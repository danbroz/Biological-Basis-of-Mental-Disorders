      "title": "The Expression of Intimacy and Sexuality in Persons With Dementia",
      "abstract": "Sexuality in dementia is infrequently addressed. Dementia is characterized by a progressive deterioration in all domains of functioning, including loss of sexual function. However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

      "abstract": "Les troubles sexuels sont nettement plus frequents chez les personnes epileptiques que dans la population generale. Dans les deux sexes, un tiers a deux tiers des patients environ presentent un ou plusieurs symptomes ou indices d’alteration de la vie sexuelle. Les troubles les plus importants, de beaucoup les plus frequents, sont inter-critiques. Dans la tres grande majorite des cas, il s’agit d’une baisse de l’activite sexuelle, qui peut affecter, isolement ou en association, le desir et l’interet sexuels, l’excitation ou l’orgasme. Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique. Les perturbations a l’origine de ces troubles sexuels sont multiples, psychologiques mais aussi physiologiques. L’etiologie de ces troubles, quasi certainement multifactorielle, reste imparfaitement elucidee. Les decharges et crises epileptiques, les lesions cerebrales, des troubles ou handicaps psychiques, intellectuels et sociaux, des modifications hormonales et neuro-endocriniennes, des effets collateraux des medicaments antiepileptiques, le traitement neuro-chirurgical de l’epilepsie sont autant de facteurs contributifs ou etiologiques dont certains sont fortement co-dependants. Les troubles sexuels en relation avec les crises sont beaucoup plus rares, qu’il s’agisse de crises comportant une semiologie de type sexuel ou d’exceptionnelles crises survenant en relation temporelle avec une activite sexuelle. En raison de la frequence des troubles sexuels intercritiques et de leur impact negatif notoire sur la qualite de vie, l’amelioration de leur depistage diagnostique et de leur prise en charge therapeutique est un objectif de soins tres important.",

      "abstract": "Cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle is an uncommon disorder, not included under the accepted definitions of functional psychoses. We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Out of the two functions constituting male sexual functions, the reproductive and the coital one, the author has made a clinical study on the latter, that is, insufficiency and impotence in the narrow sense, which has hitherto been paid little scientific attention to. The sutudy has been on psychic impotence which accounts for the most part of clinical cases and on endocrine (androgen deficient) impotence which were found conciderable in frequency.(1) The author has defined impotence as the deficiency of one or two factors of sexual pattern, that is, sexual desire, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.(2) The author's causal classification of 130 cases he treated is as follows: -a) organic cause: -penile (malformation or disease) 1.5%: endocrine (pituitary, testicular, or adrenal deficiency) 21.5%: nervous (central or distal motility, or sensory nerve damage) 4.6%. b) functional cause: -psychic (psychological 8 cases, psychic 81 cases which is 62.3%) 68.5%. c) other causes (urological cause by the disease in the urethra, in the accessory sexual glands, or by operation or external injury, diabetes mellitus, chronic consumption, physiological defect) 3. 8%. It is notworthy that out of the urological out-patient the psychic cause accounts for more than 50%.(3) Various psychic causes inhibiting the male sexual pattern were the basic factors, as the authors calls, of psychic impotence and the classification of 89 cases he treated is as follows: -sexual organ inferiority 6 cases, new marital condition 23 cases, abnormal sexual behavior 16 cases, disease anxiety or fear of disease 24 cases, suppression from the wife 3 cases, fear of conception 1 case, subconscious homosexuality 1 case, neurosis sign 8 cases, and unknown 5 cases.(4) The classification by age groups of psychic impotence is as follows: -the young group below 30 years old 45 cases, the prime-of-life group between 30 to 40 years old 18 cases, the more elderly and old age group 26 cases.(5) The author found that there was a characteristic difference between the basic factor of the young-group psychic impotence and that of the elderly-and-old-age-groups psychic impotence. The formation process of psychic impotence was that it originated from the individual's unconscious fear, doubt, anxiety, inhibitory idea about his own sexual function.(6) The treatment of psychic impotence was conducted primarily by psychotherapy through the interview at a regular interval and secondarily by medical therapy as a kind of trigger to cure. This method was sufficient and the most suitable even for a urologist.(7) The author's therapeutic result was that, out of 19 cases of new-marital impotence which is typical of young-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 2 cases unsuccessful, and uncertain of result 7 cases: and that, out of 22 cases of elderly-and-old-age-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 5 cases improved, 7 cases uncertain.(8) Endocrine impotence he treated was 28 cases and the classification of factors were that 17 cases were counted for the upper-central-nervous disorder, out of which 13 cases eunuchoidism: testicular disorders were 11 cases, out of which 8 cases post-pubertal castration, and 3 cases testicular atrophy.(9) The characteristic features of sexual pattern in endocrine impotence were that sexual desire generally declined, erotic erection and reflexible erection were damaged to various degrees, ejaculation decreasing and orgasm weakened.(10) Sexual function of castrate could be maintened and kept under control by supplying him with androgen. The author made investigation on the most efficacious method for it.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: How to Alleviate Her Suffering; Accurate Diagnosis, Tailored Treatments Can Greatly Improve Women's Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "Approximately 75% of women experience a premenstrual change in emotional or physical symptoms commonly referred to as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These symptoms--including increased irritability, tension, depressed mood, and somatic complaints such as breast tenderness and bloating--often are mild to moderate and cause minimal distress. (1) However, approximately 3% to 9% of women experience moderate to severe premenstrual mood symptoms that meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] PMDD includes depressed or labile mood, anxiety, irritability, anger, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that occur exclusively during the 2 weeks before menses and cause significant deterioration in daily functioning. Women with PMDD use general and mental health services more often than women without the condition. (3) They may experience impairment in marital and parental relationships as severe as that experienced by women with recurrent or chronic major depression. (2) PMDD often responds to treatment. Unfortunately, many women with PMDD do not seek treatment, and to 90% may go undiagnosed.4 In this article, we review the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDD. A complex disorder A distinguishing characteristic of PMDD is the timing of symptom onset. In women with PMDD, mood symptoms occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (ovulation until onset of menses) and resolve after menstruation onset. Women with PMDD report normal mood and functioning during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (first day of the menstrual cycle until ovulation). Although PMS and PMDD criteria share affective and somatic symptoms, more symptoms are required for a PMDD diagnosis, and symptoms often are more severe. (5) As defined in DSM-IV-TR (Table), (6) PMDD has a broader range of symptoms than PMS and includes symptoms not included in the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria for PMS, (7) such as impaired concentration, appetite, and sleep (hypersomnia or insomnia); and mood lability. PMDD symptoms must occur only during the 2 weeks preceding menses, although average symptoms last 6 days and severity usually peaks in the 2 days before menses. (1) The prevalence of subthreshold PMDD is fairly common; approximately 19% of women will meet some--but not all--DSM-IV-TR criteria for PMDD. (3) In a revision proposed for DSM-5, PMDD would be included as a mood disorder, which represents a significant change from DSM-IV-TR, where it is listed in the appendix as criteria. (8) In addition, in oral contraceptive users, a PMDD diagnosis should not be made unless the premenstrual symptoms are reported to be present and as severe when the woman is not taking the oral contraceptive. (8) DSM-IV-TR research criteria for PMDD A. In most menstrual cycles of the past year, [greater than or equal to] 5 of the following symptoms must be present for most of the time during the last week of the luteal phase, begin to remit within a few days after the onset of the follicular phase, and are absent in the week postmenses, with [greater than or equal to] 1 of the symptoms being either 1, 2, 3, or 4: 1. Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopeless, or self-deprecating thoughts 2. Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being keyed up or on edge 3. Marked affectivity lability 4. Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased interpersonal conflicts 5. Decreased interest in usual activities 6. Subjective sense of difficulty concentrating 7.

It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

The effect on sexual function is not normally discovered until later, often during the postoperative period, some considerable time after the onset of neurological and/or urogenital symptoms. There are few reports concerning sexual problems in CES, yet they are very common in both men and women. Loss of feeling is a significant source of sexual dissatisfaction, particularly in women. The most frequent sexual disorders reported by men are reduction in orgasm and erectile dysfunction. Ejaculatory disorders are less common. Sexual problems are often accompanied by urinary symptoms. Women most often report reduced or absent lubrication and significantly diminished libido and orgasm, often associated with local pain. Sexual dysfunction in CES is permanent and often incurable. A global approach to treatment is needed, particularly where the population suffers little motor disability and wishes to regain sexual function.",

There are no rigorous clinical studies for the treatment of these behaviors and there is no fixed classification for the types of behavior either.

The DSM-IV also excludes confounding disorders and requires confirmation of the diagnosis after 2 months of prospective daily ratings. These strict criteria reinforce the fact that not all women who have premenstrual symptoms have a mental illness. These criteria also allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is primarily reserved for milder physical and emotional symptoms.5 These criteria allow PMDD to be differentiated from premenstrual magnification (PMM), which occurs when symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder are magnified during the premenstruum.6",

Although the issue of boundaries in mental disorders is obviously profound and common, the issue of defining boundaries is especially problematic in the subthreshold diagnoses, for example AD, in which there are no symptom check lists, algorithms, or guidelines for the \"quantification of clinical features.\" There are six AD subtypes: (1) depressed mood; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed anxiety and depressed mood; (4) disturbance of conduct; (5) mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct; and (6) unspecified. In addition there is an acute form (persistence of symptoms less than 6 months) and a chronic form (persistence of symptoms for more than 6 months) after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Etiologically, the ADs are in the stress-related category of mental disorders and treatment often involves attempting to eliminate or mitigate the stressor(s), or to enhance coping with them. The AD diagnosis in children and youth has been related to more serious mental illness in adulthood. In adults the subthreshold disorder usually remits after the cessation of the putative stressor: Counseling and psychotherapy may be employed with more refractory patients.",

Whereas most symptoms of the initial prodromal condition appear to be rather un-specific and hard to distinguish from other psychiatric conditions especially depressive ones, some syndromes seem to enable an early detection and thus an indicated prevention. These are constituted by attenuated and/or transient psychotic symptoms on the one hand and certain cognitive–perceptive basic symptoms on the other. Whereas the former are thought to delineate an advanced prodromal state, the latter can occur early in course and even at the beginning of the transition sequence to first-rank symptoms.

      "title": "Depression and Cardiac Risk",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder among American adults, with lifetime prevalence rates of up to 25% in women and 12% in men, and point prevalence rates of 6% in women and 3% in men.1 These gender differences are relatively constant over adulthood, although there is evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing and the age of first onset is decreasing. Major depressive disorder is even more common among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with estimates ranging from 16% to 27%, and an additional 20% to 30% of cardiac patients with minor depression (mDD) or elevated depressive symptoms.2 Major depressive disorder is best diagnosed by a psychiatric interview. To meet criteria for MDD, a patient must report sad or “depressed” mood or a significant loss of interest in all or most things that were previously considered enjoyable for a minimum of 2 weeks, and at least an additional 4 (or 3, if both dysphoric mood and loss of pleasure are present) of the following symptoms: significant weight loss or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, decreased concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Minor depression (mDD) is not yet an official psychiatric diagnosis, but rather is a clinical syndrome often used for research purposes. Its features are similar to MDD, but with fewer depressive symptoms and less impairment. An episode of mDD involves either a sad or depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, and a total of at least 2 but less than 5 additional depressive symptoms. Dysthymia is marked by a chronically depressed mood state for at least 2 years. At least 2 additional depressive symptoms are present without meeting criteria for MDD. Self-report instruments such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Zung Depression Scale, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D) can also reliably assess depressive symptoms, although questionnaires cannot diagnose MDD and should not be considered a substitute for clinical interviews for diagnostic purposes. In this issue of the journal, Todaro and colleagues report that more than 20% of patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) met criteria for a current depressive disorder, including 9.1% for MDD, 6.4% for mDD, and 5.5% for dysthmia. These figures may be somewhat lower than expected, based on previous reports.2 However, the lower estimates may be attributable to the relatively small sample size, selective enrollment (only 82% of eligible CR participants agreed to undergo the psychiatric assessment), and use of an unfamiliar instrument, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, for the diagnosis and severity rating of depression. In addition, it is possible that patients who are referred for CR—and more importantly, follow through with the referral—may not be representative of the general cardiac population. Indeed it has been shown that patients with depression are less likely to adhere to prescribed medical therapies, including participation in CR services.3 More striking, however, was the prevalence of depression among female patients, with 43% of female CR participants meeting criteria for depressive disorder during their lifetimes compared with only 19% among males. Furthermore, almost 29% of women in the study met criteria for a current depressive disorder compared with only 9% of men. These are sobering figures and are significant for a number of important reasons: depression takes a devastating toll on patients' quality of life; adversely affects marital and social relations; results in increased use of social and medical services; is associated with more days in bed or days away from normal activities; and is responsible for enormous financial costs for treatment, lost productivity, and absenteeism from work. In addition, there is mounting evidence that depression is associated with worse prognosis, with a 2- to 5-fold increase in relative risk in patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction (MI),4 congestive heart failure,5 and post—coronary artery bypass surgery.6 Moreover, mDD, dysthymia, and even subclinical depression as measured by elevated scores on self-report instruments such as BDI and CES-D scales are associated with increased risk.2 Thus, not only recognizing depression but also successfully treating it has become a priority. Several recent studies have assessed the extent to which depression can be successfully treated in cardiac populations. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely considered to be safe for patients with CHD. For example, the SADHART study showed that sertraline did not adversely affect cardiac function and was safe for most patients.7 While non-significant or modest reductions in depressive symptoms were noted in the sample as a whole, evidence suggested that treatment was effective for patients with recurrent or more severe depression. There is also great interest in nonpharmacological approaches to treatment. Behavior therapy, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy all have been shown to be efficacious in treating depression in healthy, depressed populations without CHD. In addition, the ENRICHD trial recently showed that similar to antidepressant medication, CBT is modestly effective in reducing depression in acute post-MI patients.8 Evidence suggests that exercise therapy also may be an effective treatment for depression,9 and exercise after an acute MI has recently been reported to be associated with significantly reduced morbidity and mortality among patients with MDD,10 suggesting that exercise is a promising intervention for patients with CHD and depression. It remains to be seen whether treating depression may reduce risk of adverse events in depressed CHD patients. Although the ENRICHD trial failed to demonstrate that reducing depression improved survival, antidepressant use was actually associated with better clinical outcomes, independent of the effects on depression. Additional randomized controlled trials need to be undertaken with cardiac patients who are depressed to examine efficacy for psychosocial and “hard” clinical endpoints. It should be noted that because of improvements in the surgical and medical management of patients, it is possible that treating depression may not reduce significantly the risk of death or reinfarction over and above standard risk factors such as CHD severity and the presence of medical cormorbidities. Nevertheless, depression remains a highly prevalent and insidious comorbid condition in cardiac patients and needs to be recognized and treated, if not to prolong life then certainly to enhance patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4.

Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

Sexual dysfunction is a significant, but often underestimated, symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting 50–90% of men and 40–80% of women. The types of sexual dysfunction can be categorized in terms of the normal sexual response cycle: sexual interest/desire dysfunction (reduced libido), sexual arousal dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction) and ejaculatory and orgasmic dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction may not only be due to lesions affecting the neural pathways involved in physiological function (primary dysfunction), but also result from general physical disabilities (secondary dysfunction) or psychological and emotional issues (tertiary dysfunction). Comprehensive management should address all these possible contributing problems. Specific pharmacotherapy is only currently available for erectile dysfunction. This review summarizes the available information about sexual dysfunction in men and women with multiple sclerosis.",

      "title": "Natural history of alcohol use disorders in liver transplant patients",
      "abstract": "A. Liver transplantation (LT) patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) often have the comorbid psychiatric disorder of alcohol dependence (AD). 1. Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

PTSD may develop after a serious traumatic experience that induces feelings of intense fear, helplessness or horror. It is currently characterized by three key classes of symptoms which must cause clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning: (1) persistent and distressing re-experiencing of the trauma; (2) persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness; and (3) persistent symptoms of hyper-arousal. One of the possible symptoms within the second class is difficulty in remembering an important aspect of the traumatic event. PTSD is not an uncommon condition, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of about 7-9% based on studies conducted in the United States and Canada, with women at higher risk than men. While not everyone who experiences a significant trauma will go on to develop PTSD, about a third will do so. Sexual assault, along with other forms of assaultive violence, pose a comparatively high risk of PTSD.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "title": "Guidelines for treating depressive illness with antidepressants: A statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common illness which affects some 3% of the population per year. At least 25% of those with marked depression do not consult their general practitioner and in half of those who do the illness is not detected. Depression is easy to recognize when four or five of the core symptoms have been present for 2 weeks which often coincides with some occupational and social impairment. The core symptoms are depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, loss of energy or fatigue, concentration difficulties, appetite disturbance, sleep disturbance, agitation or retardation, worthlessness or self blame and suicidal thoughts. A diagnosis of depression is made when five of these core symptoms, one of which should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, have been present for 2 weeks. Four core symptoms are probably sufficient. Response to antidepressants is good in those with more than mild symptoms. When there are only few or very mild depressive symptoms evidence of response to antidepressants is more uncertain. Antidepressants are effective, they are not addictive and do not lose efficacy with prolonged use. The newer antidepressants have fewer side effects than the older tricyclics, they are better tolerated and lead to less withdrawals from treatment. They are less cardiotoxic and are safer in overdose. Antidepressants should be used at full therapeutic doses. Treatment failure is often due to too low a dose being used in general practice. It may be difficult to reach the right dose with the older tricyclics because of side effects. To consolidate response, treatment should be continued for at least 4 months after the patient is apparently well. Stopping the treatment before this is ill-advised as the partially treated depression frequently returns. Most depression is recurrent. Long-term antidepressant treatment is effective in reducing the risk of new episodes of depression and should be continued to keep the patient well.",

      "title": "Psychobiological Correlates of Delayed Ejaculation in Male Patients With Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The pathogenesis of delayed ejaculation (DE) is rather unknown, though the contribution of various psychological, marital, hormonal, and neurological factors has been advocated. In this study we systematically investigated the relative relevance of the aforementioned factors in 1632 men who were seeking medical help for sexual dysfunction. The severity of DE was classified according to Kaplan criteria. Mild and moderate forms of DE (MMDE) recognized different risk factors than the most severe ones (anejaculation or severe DE [ASDE]). ASDE was essentially coupled with the presence of neurological diseases or with the use of serotoninergic drugs. Serotoninergic drugs also significantly increase (by at least 10‐fold) the risk for MMDE, which, however, was also coupled with other relational factors (eg, partner's impaired climax, patient's hypoactive sexual desire [HSD]) or intrapsychic factors (eg, stress at work). At multiple regression analysis, some organic pathological conditions (such as psychiatric disorders and hypogonadism) were also associated with MMDE. In particular, hypogonadism retained significance for DE even after adjustment for HSD (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08 [1.11–3.89]; P &lt; .05), suggesting other effects of testosterone deficiency on the ejaculatory reflex besides reduced libido. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that multiple psychobiological determinants are associated with DE, a still obscure condition that substantially impairs psychosexual equilibrium of the couple.",

      "title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder",
      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

(2012) found that nearly 13% of their younger respondents (under 45) had perimenopausal symptoms which 'severely compromised quality of life', peaking amongst those who were four years post-menopause, with 31.6% reporting the same problem (p.549).Although the gradual decline with aging of hormones, like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, is the basis of natural menopause, some women have sudden onset menopause due to surgery, such as a full hysterectomy, which also removes the ovaries, or medication such as Tamoxifen for breast cancer.Equally -at least if we consult data from the Global Northsymptoms usually start to occur in a woman's mid-to-late 40s, and menopause is reached at 51.Even so, about 1% of women go through early menopause (before the age of 45), or premature menopause (before the age of 40).English language research into menopause in the Brazilian and wider Latin American context, however, suggests some compelling differences as well as some similarities between",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

Sexual dysfunction in epilepsy may result from a disturbance in social or psychological factors affecting sexual responsiveness. Alternatively, epileptiform discharges may disrupt the function of structures mediating sexual behavior, particularly the limbic cortex, or alter the release of hypothalamic or pituitary hormones. Antiepileptic drugs modulate hormone release from the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal axis and may have direct inhibitory effects on sexual behavior. Evidence both supports and refutes each of these etiologies in the sexual dysfunction seen with epilepsy. Specific evaluation and treatment protocols for patients with sexual dysfunction are available.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual symptoms include a constellation of mood, behavioral, and physical indications that occur in a cyclic pattern prior to menstruation and then wane off after the menstrual period in women of reproductive age. Most females have only mild discomfort, and symptoms do not interfere with their personal, social, or professional live; however, 5% to 8% of women have moderate-to-severe symptoms that can cause significant distress and functional impairment.Although symptoms have been recognized for a long time, the diagnostic criteria have been specified only recently. The nomenclature for disorders has changed significantly over the years, evolving from moodiness in the 18th century to premenstrual tension in the early part of 19th century to finally premenstrual in the 1950s. While some discomfort prior to menses is quite common, syndrome (PMS) includes the subset of women who experience symptoms that are severe enough to impact daily activities and functioning. Late luteal dysphoric disorder (LLDD), now known as dysphoric disorder (PMDD), accounts for the most severe form of PMS with the greatest impairment of women’s functioning and perceived quality of life, often prompting them to seek treatment.Currently, PMDD is listed in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as a separate entity under Depressive disorders, with the criteria for diagnosis as follows:Criterion A - At least 5 of the following 11 symptoms (including at least 1 of the first 4 listed) should be present: Markedly depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts Marked anxiety, tension, feelings of being “keyed up” or “on edge” Marked affective lability Persistent and marked anger or irritability or increased interpersonal conflicts Decreased interest in usual activities (eg, work, school, friends, and hobbies) Subjective sense of difficulty in concentrating Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy Marked change in appetite, overeating, or specific food cravings Hypersomnia or insomnia A subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control Other physical symptoms, such as breast tenderness or swelling, headaches, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating, or weight gain. Criterion B - symptoms severe enough to interfere significantly with social, occupational, sexual, or scholastic functioning.Criterion C - symptoms discretely related to the menstrual cycle and must not merely represent an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, dysthymic disorder, or a personality disorder (although the symptoms may be superimposed on those of these disorders).Criterion D - criteria A, B, and C confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least 2 consecutive symptomatic menstrual cycles. The diagnosis may be made provisionally before this confirmation.Women with moderate-to-severe PMS or PMDD experience more quality-of-life detriments, work-productivity losses, and incur greater healthcare costs than women with no or only mild symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is an important unwanted phenomenon of psychotropic medications.This is often underreported and not given due importance, which can often lead to impaired quality of life and less-than-optimal medication compliance.All types of psychotropic medications are linked to sexual side effects.As the underlying mental disorder improves, some of the sexual issues abate, but treatment-related sexual adverse effects may persist over time and are unfortunately underrecognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials.When it comes to sexual dysfunction due to psychiatric disorders, there are two important things to understand.First, any mental illness can cause sexual dysfunction, and second, severer the underlying psychiatric disorder, severer is the sexual dysfunction (in both frequency and severity).Even though patients may be suffering from mental illnesses of variable severity, it is important for them to have a normal and enjoyable sex life.The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction found with antidepressant medication varies considerably between different studies, making it difficult to estimate the exact incidence or prevalence.The sexual problems encompass a range of sexual disorders and include decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, and erection or delayed ejaculation problems.Patients with sexual disorders usually also have anxiety disorder and vice versa; also, women with sexual dysfunction are more prone to anxiety and depression compared with others.This happens because sex steroids and the various neurotransmitters modulate both sexual function and mood.The mechanism by which psychotropic medications affect the sexual cycle is through the interaction between medications and the various abovementioned neurotransmitters.Physicians should monitor their patients for antidepressant-induced sexual adverse effects, as these may affect compliance with therapy and the ultimate treatment success.Sexual function should be actively assessed at regular intervals.Management of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction requires an individualized approach.",

      "abstract": "Stalkers can be loosely divided into those without a mental disorder (usually disgruntled ex-partners) and those who are mentally disordered. Although the former group is by far the larger, very little is known about the characteristics of those stalkers. The mentally disordered group comprises mainly those with erotomanic delusions, presenting either as a primary illness or secondary to another mental illness. The impact of stalking on victims is enormous - many develop post-traumatic stress disorder, contemplate suicide and suffer immense disruption to their lives. A sizeable portion of stalking victims are subjected to physical and/or sexual assault. Anti-stalking laws are usually ineffective against erotomanic stalkers, but may be more effective in deterring non-disordered stalkers. The efficacy of treatment for mentally disordered stalkers is mixed - in some cases the illness resolves completely while in others it persists unabated, often for decades.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "title": "Review of Delusional Jealousy and Its Association with Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Introduction Mental state changes can affect one’s sexual life, while sexual dysfunction can lead to relationship challenges. Delusional jealousy, also called Othello syndrome, involves a paranoid belief in a partner’s infidelity, leading to controlling and violent behaviors. It can manifest as a paranoid disorder, as a delusional symptom of psychiatric, neurological or other medical conditions, or as side effect of dopaminergic medication. Although its exact prevalence remains uncertain, it has been identified in 0.5-1.4% of psychiatry inpatients. Objectives To describe sexual dysfunctions associated with delusional jealousy and to explore strategies for addressing these dysfunction. Methods A non-systematic review of the literature available at PubMed was conducted using the keywords “Sexual Dysfunction” AND “Delusional Jealousy OR Othello Syndrome”. Results A number of factors, including sexual dysfunction, can trigger or exacerbate delusional jealousy. This is especially true for middle-aged men who have a history of alcohol consumption, neurological or personality disorders. Individuals with sexual dysfunction experience feelings of insecurity, projecting these concerns onto their partners and suspecting extramarital relationships. On the other hand, sexual dysfunctions such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Female Sexual Arousal and Orgasmic Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction and Ejaculation Disturbance may occur as consequence of Othello Syndrome. Multiple factors contribute to these dysfunctions, including increased testosterone and cortisol levels, chronic alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric conditions and antipsychotics. There are reports of increased sexual desire, especially in cases of dementia. Conclusions Although the evidence is limited and dated, it points to a bidirectional association between delusional jealousy and sexual dysfunction. Further studies are essential to determine the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunctions in Othello syndrome, and the causal relationship between them. Additionally, investigating gender differences is crucial, given the male-centric focus of existing studies. This research can contribute to clinical care by promoting the screening for sexual issues and their integration into delusional jealousy management. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Although many studies have been published on the subject, only some used a validated sexual function rating scale and most lacked either a baseline or placebo control or both. In addition, many of the studies on sexual dysfunction associated with antipsychotic medication are limited by other methodological flaws. However, there is consistent evidence to suggest that a large number of antipsychotic drugs adversely affect one or more of the 3 phases of sexual response (desire, arousal and orgasm). Among the antipsychotics, the so called \"prolactin-raising\" are probably most associated with sexual dysfunction, even if further studies to confirm this are needed: the reviewed literature shows no consistent evidence that any one antipsychotic drug has a significantly superior side effect profile over another and current information on this topic is often based on methodologically weak research. Clinicians must be aware of drug-induced sexual dysfunction, since its presence can have important consequences for clinical management and compliance.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT– Thirty‐seven, out of a sample of 100 elderly subjects, all suffering from dementia, were found to have delusions. The delusions were more common in women, in patients with a history of psychiatric illness, and amongst those with higher information subscores (Blessed Scale); and were less common in patients suffering from apraxia or severe psychosocial incompetence. Amongst the deluded patients the simultaneous presence of disorientation, hallucinations and hyperactivity often signified the diagnosis of delirium, but on follow up it was not correlated with death within 18 months. The same symptoms in the non‐deluded patients were correlated with severe social incompetence and death within 18 months. It is concluded that the presence of delusions in subjects over 75 years old suffering from dementia is related, to certain extent, to previous or concomitant psychiatric illness, and that it reflects a relative preservation of mental function amongst those without such history.",

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

In addition there are several times as many unsuccessful suicide attempts and attempted homicides, mayhems, and serious assaults and batteries. It is safe to say that a large portion of these involve persons with psychiatric disorders and thus fall under medical jurisdiction. Some of these individuals are overtly psychotic: deluded and hallucinated, or uncontrollably depressed, or assailed by intolerable anxiety, guilt, or hostile feelings. More are acutely neurotic, and their acts may be seen as manipulative gestures, or cries for help, or acting-out maneuvers. A large portion have disordered personalities and faulty character structures, often with alcoholism, narcotic addiction, sexual psychopathy, passive-aggressive disturbance, or emotional immaturity, instability, or inadequacy. Frequent accompaniments are adolescent turmoil, marital discord, school or work problems, chronic or terminal illness, or geriatric disease. Thus the physician has usually been consulted before",

An unanticipated opportunity for King David to peep at Bathsheba led him to a train of Biblical woes and Nathan's rebuke. According to old lore, Tom's peeping at Lady Godiva led God to blind him. The stories of King David and Tom are presented as examples of “sinful,” not pathological, behavior. Neither story provides enough details to permit a diagnosis of voyeurism for either man. Voyeurism as a diagnosis came later. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), voyeurism requires more than isolated episodes of peeping. The DSM‐IV‐TR diagnosis of voyeurism has three criteria; (1) The patient must have recurrent sexual fantasies, urges, or acts of observing an unsuspecting person naked, in the process of undressing, or having sex; (2) The patient must have had these recurrent fantasies, urges, and acts for at least six months; and (3) Either the patient has engaged in peeping or, if not, is having personal or interpersonal difficulties as a result of voyeuristic interests.",

At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

Some clinical studies have shown that potency is not always associated with normal hemodynamics or vice-versa Therefore other factors may also be responsible for rigid erection. This disparity between penile rigidity and hemodynamic erectile response is because of expandability of erectile tissue as described by Udelson et al -(6-8) .

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

Among the leading causes of disability globally, BD is a major concern. Among all mental health illnesses, sexual dysfunction is underestimated and more common in the general population compared to those with mental health issues. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the sexual abnormalities and behaviors that are often seen in bipolar female patients. Final thoughts: Sexual dysfunctions and abnormal behaviors were more common in women with BD. Manic episodes are associated with increased hazardous sexual conduct in people with BD. Additionally, it was mentioned that couples' sexual pleasure is negatively impacted by hypersexuality during manic episodes and hyposexuality during depressed episodes, and this effect typically continues into the times between episodes. On the other hand, sex may be linked to negative emotions rather than diminished desire during depressed periods. Individuals with mental health illnesses have a greater chance of sexual difficulties damaging personal interactions and quality of life.",

      "title": "The multifactorial aetiology and management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with leuprorelin acetate",
      "abstract": "Up to 18% of women of reproductive age may experience symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or its more severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). A plethora of symptoms have been described, but both are commonly associated with other mood-related disorders such as major depression causing significant life impairment. Originally known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in the DSM-III-R ( American Psychiatric Association 1987 ), the syndrome was renamed PMDD in the DSM-IV ( American Psychiatric Association 1994 ). Between 3% and 8% of women meet the diagnostic criteria for PMDD. Currently, there is no consensus on its aetiology although it is thought to be multifactorial. Biological, genetic, psychological, environmental and social factors have all been suggested. However, an altered sensitivity to the normal hormonal fluctuations that influence functioning of the central nervous system is thought most likely. PMDD is identified in the DSM-5 by the presence of at least five symptoms accompanied by significant psychosocial or functional impairment. During evaluation, it is recommended that clinicians confirm symptoms by prospective patient mood charting for at least two menstrual cycles. Management options include psychotropic agents, ovulation suppression and dietary modification. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered primary therapy for psychological symptoms. Ovulation suppression is another option with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists. Rarely symptoms warrant a bilateral oophorectomy and a 6-month trial of GnRH agonists prior to surgery may be prudent to determine its potential efficacy. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her mid-30s experiencing severe symptoms during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle. A trial of the contraceptive pill and SSRIs were unsuccessful. Treatment with leuprorelin acetate (Prostap) improved her symptoms. She therefore elected to undergo a bilateral oophorectomy with resolution of her symptoms. She started hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This case demonstrates the multifactorial aetiology of PMDD and the challenges in its management. Women with PMDD suffer functional impairments comparable with other depressive disorders and yet PMDD and its impact remain under-recognised. As the psychological nature and consequences of PMDD often seem indistinguishable from symptoms of other mental health difficulties, this condition presents distinct diagnostic challenges for healthcare professionals. It is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis using clearly defined criteria because if it is left untreated, it can cause considerable impairment to the woman’s quality of life.",

However, in 10-20% of patients, the pain persists for months or years despite relevant treatment trials. Both acute (duration <3 months) and chronic (duration> 3 months) conditions are investigated through a diagnostic triage: • First, it is clarified whether red flags are present that require prompt action. • Thereafter, we assess whether the pain is due to possible specific diagnoses. • If the patient is in the residual group, a broader assessment is made to identify any treatment options and prognosis. Essential clinical characteristics RED FLAGS Any initial assessment of the patient with back pain is initiated by clinically identifying the few serious diagnoses that require urgent or urgent action: Sphincter symptoms or abnormal sensitivity / reflex conditions of the perineum cause cauda equina syndrome. Progressive palsy of upper or lower extremities or paralysis is often indicative of threatening nerve root incarceration. L’Hermitte’s signs, bilateral UE symptoms, hyper-reflex or Babinski’s toe phenomenon. Think incipient medullary cross-sectional syndrome. Common symptoms with eg weight loss, fatigue and fever, previous cancer disease, +50 years. Think of other red flags like infection, system disease or cancer.",

Obesity and smoking have also been identified as risk factors. Symptoms could be physical, psychological, emotional, environmental and/or behavioral and affect the ability to perform normal daily activities as well as adversely affect interpersonal relationships. Though several theories have been propounded, the exact cause of premenstrual syndrome is unknown.

The excitement is not linked to sexual desire and may also be triggered by non sexual stimuli, as mere vibrations; moreover it cannot find a way out in an orgasm, which often proves unsatisfactory. Causes that may contribute to increase female sexual activity, be it egosyntonic or egodistonic, pleasant or disturbing for the couple, are still not appropriately investigated (Leiblum, Graziottin, 2007).",

Healthcare providers have also increasingly appreciated the impact that adverse effects of treatment can have on quality of life, as well as on compliance with and the effectiveness of treatment. Many functional impairments and adverse treatment effects take the form of clinical complaints that patients and caregivers typically report to their healthcare providers without prompting. Other adverse effects are not so obviously clinical or treatment-related, and patients may not be inclined or may even be reluctant to bring them up when talking with the provider. Impairment of sexual function is a problem of this kind. Sexual dysfunction appears to be common and frequently underrecognized in certain patient populations. For example, it has been estimated that 25% to 63% of women and 10% to 52% of men with epilepsy have some form of sexual dysfunction, yet in clinical reviews of sexual disorders, epilepsy is not listed as one of the medical conditions commonly associated with impaired sexual function.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

Thirty patients have been studied with this discharge as the chief complaint and 8 patients presenting various nervous complaints in addition. These patients usually showed few or no pus cells in urethral or prostatic smears. Patients have been reported only in whom a definite psychiatric diagnosis was possible, as follows in order of frequency: reactive depression, anxiety state, hysteria, prepsychotic personality, and psychopathic personality. Previous personality characteristics were frequently as follows: excessive conscientiousness, excessive shyness, tendency to drift on the line of least resistance, hypochondriasis, and excessive dependency. Usually the sexual activity was that of continence with an occasional lapse always followed by guilt feelings. The discharge often developed after a period of continence with temptation, excepting in a proportion of cases in which it represented the persistence of an originally infective discharge. Its onset or persistence could usually be correlated with the psychiatric history. Twenty-eight patients were given psychiatric treatment, mostly psychotherapy at a fairly superficial level. Short term follow-up indicated improvement in the local condition as well as the psychiatric disorder, although failures occurred and risks were involved. Probable mechanisms have been discussed in relation to the relevant literature.",

A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

      "abstract": "Depression affects up to one in ten older adults at any one time. It is more common in those with physical health problems and is associated with shorter life expectancy. In initial screening, all possible symptoms of depression should be counted toward meeting the criteria of a depressive episode regardless of a coexistent physical disorder. Screening tests typically miss more cases in older adults with physical morbidity. The best available evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy or antidepressants are effective for mild-to-moderate major depressive episodes. Antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy may be considered in more severe episodes.",

The first symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome include: • Progressive muscle weakness on both sides of the legs, arms, and face. • Prickly, tingling sensations, usually in the feet or hands. • Pain is a significant complaint. • Loss of normal reflexes. Symptoms may develop over a period of hours, days, or weeks. They will vary in severity from minimal to total paralysis including respiratory weakness. The symptoms grow progressively worse. Most patients recover fully, but as many as 25% will have some residual symptoms. Five to ten percent have permanent, disabling deficits, and for 5% the condition is fatal. Diagnosis is dependant on the physical exam and history, cerebrospinal fluid findings, and nerve conduction studies.

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "A young woman with intense longings for love was unable to satisfy these desires by a normal sexual relationship with a man because of her fears and inhibitions. She developed urticaria at times when her longings were especially stimulated and frustrated. Twelve attacks were observed during analysis and their emotional settings are described. Eight of them occurred in connection with dreams. These dreams invariably ended on the verge of frustration in an \"almost but not quite\" situation. Other types of dreams out of a total of 94 were never followed by urticaria and vice versa, with the exception of a repetitive dream of reaching for an object or person who slipped from the patient's grasp. This dream was followed by weeping, when not by urticaria. The urticaria appeared when weeping was repressed and often terminated when the patient wept. Some of the observations are somewhat suggestive concerning the choice of sites for the urticaria. The findings were confirmed by a second analyzed case and by a few observations on five cases seen in interview. In connection with other observations, particularly on asthma, they led to the supposition of a possible relationship between certain states of allergic sensitivity and states of intense frustrated longing.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "title": "ABC of psychological medicine: Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Fatigue can refer to a subjective symptom of malaise and aversion to activity or to objectively impaired performance. It has both physical and mental aspects. The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",

In most reported cases, men are identified as perpetrators regardless of the sex of the individual assaulted. There typically is some form of relationship between the survivor and the perpetrator-whether it be an acquaintance, friend, family member, or authority figure. As such, female patients should be asked routinely about a history of sexual assault, particularly if the patient reports relevant physical symptoms and/or substance abuse. Factors that could lead to children experiencing sexual assault (particularly via domestic minor sex trafficking) include a history of abuse, substance use, mental health issues, family dysfunction, and the involvement of Child Protective Services. Short-term goals of primary care include management of physical injuries and psychological needs, evaluation for pregnancy, and prevention of sexually transmitted infections. Long-term effects may include sexual dysfunction, mental disorders (eg, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder), and medical symptoms (eg, chronic headache, infections).",

About 50% of all female and about 75% of all male patients complain of sexual dysfunctions. The primary symptoms among males are erective and ejaculative dysfunctions and reduced libido, while female patients mainly complain of reduced libido, problems achieving orgasm, decreased vaginal lubrication and changes in vaginal sensitivity. Secondary organic symptoms include fatigue, spasticity, muscular weakness, bladder problems, pain, cognitive and behavioural changes. Tertiary dysfunctions refer to general psychosocial problems in relation to chronic, progressive disease. One third of all couples in which either the man or the woman suffers from MS complain of problems in sexual and marital life, where especially the healthy female partner in general has sexual problems. Diagnosing and treating sexual dysfunctions in MS should ideally be carried out by a specialized \"MS-team\" with the core professionals being the neurologist, urologist, (neuro) psychologist and the nurse. Information about symptoms and their possible causes is an important part of the treatment, and not least learning more efficient coping strategies. Both for the patient and for the couple honest and open informative communication including information about sexual aids and perhaps also medical treatment will often result in minimizing the sexual problems and increasing quality of life.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a collection of physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms causing clinically significant distress or interference that occur in the 7 days prior to the onset of menses, after which they become minimal or absent. The diagnosis is established by symptom documentation using a validated, reliable tool such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for at least 2 menstrual cycles to confirm the timing of relevant symptoms. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there is a 1.8%-5.8% 12-month prevalence of PMDD among menstruating women1; however, the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms causing clinically significant interference or distress but not meeting full criteria for a diagnosis of PMDD may be as high as 13%-18%.",

      "title": "Schizoaffective Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) is characterized by excessive or poorly controlled sexual thoughts, urges, or behaviors, and was first described over 100 years ago. Although there is little consensus about definition or classification, CSB is generally thought to involve both paraphilic (e.g., pedophilia, voyeurism) and nonparaphilic (e.g., compulsive masturbation) forms. CSB has been estimated to affect as much as 5% of the United States population; 80%-90% of those with CSB are male. Onset occurs in the late teens or early twenties, and the disorder is generally chronic or episodic. Psychiatric comorbidity is common, particularly substance use and mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. Developmental, behavioral, neurobiologic, and sociocultural mechanisms probably play a role in the etiology of CSB and its expression. Treatment has not been well delineated, but individual psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and 12-step programs may be helpful. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help some patients regulate their sexual impulses, while anti-androgens may be helpful in sexually aggressive forms of CSB.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction covers a range of disturbances in sexual response affecting desire, arousal, and orgasm or involving pain with sexual activity. Depression and sexual dysfunction have long been known as comorbid conditions; however, some research suggests that depressed mood may not always be associated with specific sexual dysfunctions. Associations between sexual dysfunction and depression appears bidirectional, such that either one of these conditions may trigger or worsen the other, while improvement in one may also improve the other. This chapter examines the complex relationship between depression and male and female sexual dysfunctions. We explore the classification and prevalence of sexual dysfunction, the known interconnections involving neurobiology, and psychological issues. Finally, we summarize the core principles of evaluation and treatment of common sexual dysfunctions, particularly in the context of depressive illness.",

      "abstract": "Spontaneous orgasm is characterized by a spontaneous onset of orgasm without any preceding sexual or nonsexual trigger. It sheds insight on the mechanisms underlying orgasms and the sexual response cycle in humans.We report a male patient of repetitive spontaneous orgasm under trazodone treatment and systematically review the literature on drug-associated spontaneous orgasm (DASO).A total of 25 patients (18 women and 7 men), including our reported case, experienced 27 DASO events. Over half of them were under 50 years of age during the DASO event. Depression was the leading morbidity for these patients, and a limited list of antidepressants and antipsychotics were involved in 92.5% of all DASO events. Although offending drugs possess variable pharmacological properties, their common effect is an augmentation of serotonin-1A (5HT1A) neurotransmission. Offending drugs seemingly increase personal susceptibility to DASO. Over half of the patients, especially men, did not concurrently experience sexual arousal or desire during the DASO event. In the remaining patients, the orgasm was accompanied by or ensued with arousal or desire. A reduction of dose or discontinuation of the offending drug usually abolished DASO.It appears that 5HT1A has a key role in generating orgasm. Orgasms may be activated through arousal-independent or arousal-dependent pathways, and both orgasms and sexual arousal are bidirectionally activated. This double-bidirectional model of sexual response cycle may promote the success of sexual procreation and recreation, and further research on this pathway could offer an innovative method to manage anorgasmia in the future.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

From adolescence, women have a 1.5-3 times higher risk than men of suffering different depressive disorders. Traditionally, it has been assumed that transition to menopause, or perimenopause, is a period of higher depressive vulnerability, although there is some degree of controversy. This period seems to be associated with the appearance of both depressive symptoms and de novo depressive disorders, particularly if a background of depression exists. With regard to its etiopathogeny, genetic, hormonal, psychological and sociocultural factors have been suggested, but there are no solid data that support any of these explanations. Treatment basically depends on the severity of the disorder and includes antidepressants and/or psychotherapy. Maintained treatment with hormone replacement therapy (estrogens) is under discussion.",

However, some women experience severe physical and/or psychological symptoms before menstruation, which, if left untreated, can lead to a reduced quality of life. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) remain unclear. Despite the fact that PMS etiology remains unknown, there are some theories and studies supporting them that inappropriate inflammatory response and oxidative stress may be considered as the causes of occurrence of PMS. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be nonspecific and individual for each specific woman, the diagnosis is made only on the basis of symptoms, pathognomonic hormonal disorders do not exist. Rarely, the symptoms are expressed to an extreme degree and disrupt the ability to work and the rhythm of a woman’s life, then premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) should be assumed, which is often underestimated, and the patient should be recommended to record her symptoms for ≥2 cycles. Usually, the treatment of premenstrual syndrome involves a combination of various methods in order to determine the most effective in each individual case: treatment includes lifestyle changes, micronutrient support, herbal medicine, pharmacotherapy. Drospirenone-containing combined oral contraceptives are first line for PMS and PMDD. Herbal medicines are used as maintenance therapy. Transdermal estradiol and cyclical gestogens in phase 2 of the menstrual cycle can be used as second line hormonal therapy.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

We present 4 cases, one each of primary and secondary amenorrhea, MMR, and MP, respectively. In the first 3 cases (2 amenorrhea and 1 MMR), we found psychogenic factors: an insult to feminine development after rape (case 1) or marriage problems (cases 2 and 3). In the case of a recurrent MP, no relevant psychological etiology was found. Furthermore, some of the patient's relatives had menstrual or peripartum psychiatric disorders. Menstrual disorders' etiology can be psychogenic or hormonal.

The autopsy cases (n=24) were divided into three groups: positional asphyxia was the cause of death (n=15); unknown cause of death but positional asphyxia was considered (n=4); and positional asphyxia was suspected to be a contributing factor (n=5). All cases of group A included postures that could interfere with breathing, but the typical jackknife or head-down postures were seen in approximately half of the cases; “classic signs of asphyxia” were also observed in approximately half of the cases. They shared features such as high blood alcohol concentration, therapeutic levels of drugs, various disease, minor head trauma, and morbid obesity; however, no definite diagnostic criteria have been established for forensic practice. Positional asphyxia is a form of mechanical asphyxia which must be differentiated from traumatic asphyxia. In addition to a complete autopsy, thorough laboratory tests and understanding of the circumstances of the case and the situation at the death scene are required for diagnosis. Special attention is required for the diagnosis of special types of positional asphyxia such as death during institutional restraint or prone restraint.",

For such problems to be diagnosed as a sexual dysfunction, the concerns need to be further identified as personally distressing. The DSM-5 recognizes seven sexual problems: female interest/arousal disorder, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, erectile disorder, premature (early) ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, female orgasmic disorder, and genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Although individuals may present with a range of sexual problems, DSM-5 recognizes only three major categories of sexual dysfunction: interest/arousal, orgasm, and pain. This chapter reviews each sexual dysfunction, with a specific focus on the diagnostic criteria and prevalence rates, as well as known psychological and biological etiological factors.",

      "abstract": "In Brief Low or absent sexual desire is the most common sexual dysfunction in women, and its prevalence peaks during midlife. Its etiology is complex and may include biologic, psychologic, and social elements. Major risk factors for its development include poor health status, depression, certain medications, dissatisfaction with partner relationship, and history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or both. Diagnosis is based on criteria set by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) and requires that a woman experience personal distress. Clinical evaluation should include medical history, sexual history, and, sometimes, a physical examination. Laboratory data are of limited value, except when warranted by history or physical examination. Treatment options include nonpharmacologic interventions such as education, office-based counseling, and psychotherapy. Although there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved treatments for low desire, pharmacologic agents have been used off-label for this purpose. Bupropion is an antidepressant that has been shown to improve desire in some women with and without depression. Systemic estrogen therapy is not recommended in the absence of vasomotor symptoms and is not directly associated with desire. However, vaginal estrogen is useful in patients presenting with concomitant vaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that can be used as an alternative to vaginal estrogen. Exogenous testosterone has demonstrated efficacy in treating loss of desire in postmenopausal women. However, patients should be counseled that it is not FDA-approved for this purpose and there are limited published long-term safety data. Several agents for the treatment of low desire are currently in development. Gynecologists are in a unique position to address concerns about sexual desire in women. Low or absent sexual desire is the most common sexual dysfunction among women.",

At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech.

The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis.

Doctors often do not recognize the signs of sexual abuse. Most victims of rape have symptoms that may develop into posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if they persist for more than 4 weeks, such as sleep problems or panic attacks. Victims of sexual abuse also more often develop a psychiatric disorder or medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Doctors should ask about sexual abuse in cases of MUS or unexplained mental problems. The complications of abuse can be treated with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) or cognitive processing therapy (CPT).",

Many risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia have been identified, the most important of which are previous suicide attempts, depression, hopelessness, substance abuse, and male gender. Insight into having a serious mental illness and less severe cognitive impairment are also associated with increased risk for suicide in schizophrenia, most likely when accompanied by feelings of hopelessness. Typical neuroleptic drugs have not been shown to reduce the risk of suicide. However, several types of evidence suggest that clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, appreciably reduces the suicide attempt and completion rates in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, perhaps by as much as 75‐85%. Other atypical antipsychotic drugs may have a similar effect, but direct evidence is lacking. Improvement in positive and negative symptoms, reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), a direct antidepressant action, improved cognitive function, and improved compliance may contribute to reduced suicidality. The International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) is a large prospective, randomized study intended to compare the effectiveness of clozapine with that of olanzapine in reducing suicide and suicide‐related events in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients. Some information about suicidality in the patient sample is reported here.",

      "title": "Management of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 35-year-old married woman with an obsessive compulsive disorder. She had a 21-year history of obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors including compulsive checking which had become persistent since the birth of her first child. There is no evidence of comorbidity, except for a mild generalized anxiety disorder. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common chronic, and disabling disorder characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive and distressing thoughts, images, or impulses. Compulsions are repetitive, intentional behaviors that the person feels compelled to perform, often with a desire to resist. Compulsions are typically intended to avert some fear event or to reduce distress. These symptoms are ego-dystonic and cause significant distress to patients and their families. OCD is among the most common anxiety disorders, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 2.3% [1]. It is almost equally distributed between males and females.OCD often begins in adolescence or early adulthood usually with a gradual onset. However, a rapid onset of symptoms may occur, sometimes associated with a traumatic event, such as pregnancy or loss. Actually, recent literature suggests that pregnancy may precipitate OCD in individuals [2, 3], as in our case report. It appears that patients who reported the onset or worsening of OCD symptoms in pregnancy developed fear of harming the fetus or child [3, 4]. However, in our case report, the patient's preoccupations deal with responsibility for her child's health (e.g. 'my son will choke to death with his blanket if I don't check'): the patient does not fear being responsible for any harm coming to her son. Due to the secretive nature of the disorder, there is often a delay of more than 10 years before patients come to specialty settings [5]. The trouble is usually long, with most patients experiencing a chronic course, while others experience a fluctuating one [6].Patients with both obsessions and compulsions constitute a large proportion of affected patients. OCD can be expressed through many different symptoms. The classical presentation includes obsessive thoughts and ritualistic behaviors of washing and/or checking. Another pattern is one with merely intrusive obsessional thoughts, without compulsion (table 1).OCD can be severely incapacitating: depression is the most common complication and the symptoms can spread to interfere with the patient's social and occupational functioning, often involving the entire family.The case report thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or psychiatric unit. The patient meets the criteria for OCD according the DSM-IV [7].Until the early 1970s, OCD was considered a treatment refractory, chronic situation. Neither psychodynamic therapy nor a variety of pharmacological treatments, available at that time, led to significant improvement. Today, substantial evidence suggests that behavior therapy is effective in treating this chronic disorder [8]. Furthermore, recent advances in pharmacotherapy have led to a significant reduction in suffering and a return to productive living for many patients with OCD [9]. OCD is currently treated with pharmacological and/or psychological approaches. Our patient refused any pharmacological treatment; thus we recommended psychotherapy (20 sessions).Among the best established treatments are behavioral therapy, particularly those involving exposure and response prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) involves the combination of behavior therapy (BT; exposure with response prevention, ERP) and cognitive therapy (CT). After more than a quarter century of research, ERP has become the gold standard to which other psychological treatments for OCD, such as CT, have been compared [10]. For CBT15–20 sessions are proposed for the treatment of an uncomplicated OCD patient. The format is individual weekly therapy sessions. A maintenance schedule is required (monthly booster sessions for 6–12 months).BT for OCD most specifically involves exposure and response or ritual prevention. The effectiveness of BT, in the form of ERP for OCD, has been demonstrated in controlled studies and meta-analyses [11, 12]. To date, the last meta-analysis [12]including 77 studies with 4,651 patients showed that BT was superior to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Exposure capitalizes on the fact that anxiety usually attenuates after a sufficient duration of contact with a feared stimulus. In order to achieve adequate exposure, it is usually necessary to help the patient block the rituals or avoidance behaviors, a process termed response or ritual prevention. In fact, the OCD patient is exposed to stimuli that provoke the obsessive response and helped to desist from avoidance and escape (compulsive) behavior. The rationale for treatment has to be outlined in the detail during the initial session for the patient and significant others, if present. This rationale uses a functional analysis to describe the patient's symptoms and to explain how the reduction of anxiety through compulsions maintains the behavior. It includes the theoretical and practical implications of ERP, focusing on the reduction of anxiety and rituals, and explains imaginary and in vivo exposure. Information gathering includes current OCD symptoms and general functioning, administration of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, course and history of OCD, previous treatment and response, general psychosocial and family history. Information gathering usually requires three sessions. Treatment planning has to be completed in the session preceding the first exposure session, focusing on the construction of a hierarchy (which includes items that the patient either currently avoids or performs only with rituals). The patient is asked to rate each item on a rating scale in which 0 indicates no anxiety and 100 indicates maximum anxiety. After the situations are ranked from lowest to highest anxiety rating, exposure therapy proceeds upward on the hierarchy, beginning with the lower-rated items to maximize compliance of the patient. The techniques which have to be used are therapist-aided ERP in imagination and/or in vivo, exposure in vivo with response prevention through homework and family intervention whenever the family is involved in rituals [13, 14]. The patients have to record homework completion. Behavioral homework is discussed and set with the therapist.To date less attention has been paid to CT, which may be added to ERP, to address such things as faulty estimation of danger or the exaggerated sense of personal responsibility often seen in OCD patients. The first step in CT for OCD consists of informing the patient that his/her intrusive thoughts are an abnormal phenomenon and provides him or her with a list of intrusive thoughts that commonly occur in the general population [15]. The patient learns that the difference between normal and dysfunctional intrusive thoughts lies in the significance attached to these thoughts. The interpretation of these intrusive thoughts made by people with obsession affects the occurrence and/or the content of these thoughts [16]. An important general cognitive technique used by the therapist to challenge the automatic thoughts is Socratic Dialogue [17]. The patient is encouraged to question the catastrophic significance of the intrusive thought and to construct alternative less catastrophic interpretations. Behavioral experiments are also commonly used to test the empirical basis of the patient's new interpretation in order to challenge or evaluate the beliefs. Two controlled trials compared CT based on Beck's model and ERP. Van Oppen et al. [10]demonstrated that CT was better than ERP at the post-test phase, but to date no follow-up of this study has been published. In a randomized controlled trial [18]CT and intensive BT were equally effective on OCD, but at post-test CT had specific effects on depression which were stronger than those of BT. Findings for the 1-year follow-up study are presently in preparation. The principal finding is that benefits are maintained and both treatments produced equivalent results: at week 26 and 52, improvement was retained in both groups without between-group difference. Cognitive measures of obsessions changed equally in the 2 groups.In our case, the first 3 sessions were assigned to the behavioral analysis, the therapeutic goals, and evaluation. We then started the CT from session 3 to 12. We first explained the OCD cognitive model to the patient, and then we taught her to point out and modify her automatic thoughts and cognitive biases. Automatic thoughts dealt with disasters and her responsibility for these ('if I haven't closed the window, someone will enter and take my son away'). During the 13th session, we started the behavioral therapy (ERP) for 8 sessions. After having explained the OCD behavioral model and the habituation principle to the patient, we set up a hierarchy in order to expose the patient (imaginary and in vivo exposure).The predominant hypothesis about OCD pathophysiology implicates abnormal serotonergic function regulation. Research clearly shows that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only effective treatments for OCD. These medications increase the concentration of serotonin. Six SRIs are currently available: clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram are SSRIs because they primarily affect only serotonin. Clomipramine is a nonselective SRI: it affects many other neurotransmitters besides serotonin.In most cases, treatment should be initiated with a SSRI because of the superior safety tolerability, and equivalent efficacy of this class of drug compared with clomipramine [19]. Actually, there have been relatively few comparative studies between the SSRIs in the treatment of OCD [20, 21, 22]. The studies comparing SSRI and clomipramine have shown that they all demonstrated efficacy [23, 24]. However, clomipramine is also associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In a flexible dose trial of paroxetine compared with clomipramine in 406 patients with OCD [26], paroxetine and clomipramine were more effective than placebo. In terms of efficacy, no significant difference between paroxetine and clomipramine were noted beginning at week 6, and the response was nearly equivalent at week 12. However, significantly more patients treated with clomipramine withdrew from the study because of adverse effects. In a review of the efficacy of SRIs in OCD [30], the authors reported that SSRIs possess efficacy similar to that of clomipramine, but have a superior side effect profile. This suggestion may have important implications for patients with OCD who require long-term treatment. In a multicenter meta-analysis [31]placebo-controlled trials found clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline to be superior to placebo. These authors also found that the 3 SSRIs were comparable to each other in efficacy and that clomipramine was more effective than the SSRIs. Stein et al. [32]presented a meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy trials for OCD. In placebo-controlled trials, SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) had a significant effect on medication effect size with clomipramine more effective than fluoxetine. Another meta- analytic review of the efficacy of drug treatments [33]found that SRIs (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and sertraline) are effective in short-term treatments for patients suffering from OCD; although the increase in improvement rate over placebo was greater for clomipramine than for SSRIs, direct comparison between these drugs showed that they had similar therapeutic efficacy on obsessive-compulsive symptoms; concomitant high levels of depression at the outset did not seem necessary for clomipramine and for SSRIs to improve obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In a meta-analysis comparing pharmacological treatments of OCD (clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline) [34], clomipramine was not significantly better than fluoxetine or fluvoxamine; no significant difference was found between clomipramine and the other SRIs as a group in head to head trials; furthermore, no difference in drop-out rates was found. Clomipramine stands out from the other SRIs. The authors conclude that this difference is probably not clinically significant enough to warrant first choice treatment, given clomipramine's greater lethality in overdose.The backbone of pharmacological treatment for OCD is a 10- to 12- week trial with clomipramine or a SSRI in adequate doses before initiating alternative therapy. Actually, OCD appears to respond in a time interval of approximately 8–12 weeks. Clinical experience suggests the necessity of long-term, and in some case lifelong treatment. As far as pharmacologic treatment is concerned, a drug treatment should last at least 2 years after the remission of symptoms before considering medication withdrawal. This is motivated by the fact that preliminary evidence suggests that relapses after discontinuation of the drug are associated with increased resistance of treatment [35]. If the patient does not respond to an average dose of SSRI, the experts [36]recommend gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 4–8 weeks from the start of the treatment. When a patient is having a partial response to an average dose of SSRI, the experts suggest gradually increasing the dose to its maximum within 5–9 weeks from the start of the treatment. They consider 8–13 weeks an adequate medication trial before changing medication or augmenting with another agent.Despite these significant advances in pharmacological treatment with SSRIs and clomipramine, as many as 40–60% of OCD patients are clinically unchanged after an adequate trial with these agents [37].Simos [38]reported that the efficacy of combined BT and pharmacotherapy for OCD is controversial. In a review of relevant studies, Steketee [39]concluded that this combination has shown little advantage over BT alone. Preliminary findings from a trial by Kozak et al. [40]also supported this conclusion. However, some controlled studies combining BT with antidepressants showed a better outcome on rituals and depression in the long term. In particular, Cottraux et al. [41]showed that SSRI + BT compared to placebo + BT gives better results at 3 months on rituals and at 6 months on depression with equivalent results at 12 and 18 months. Moreover, a more recent but small sample study comparing CBT and medication in the treatment of OCD provided evidence in favor of the combination [42]. OCD patients received 1 of 4 treatments: medication and CBT simultaneously; CBT only; medication while on a waiting list for CBT, or no treatment while on a waiting list for CBT. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and clinical ratings significantly improved after treatment in all groups except the non-treatment, waiting list, control group. Subjects in the 2 treatment groups receiving CBT showed reduced strength in their obsessional beliefs. The subsequent administration of CBT to those groups on the waiting list also decreased the strength of their primary obsessional beliefs and beliefs about the consequences of not performing the rituals. Results of this small sample study suggest that either CBT or medication alone is more effective than no treatment. The combination seems to potentiate treatment efficacy, and, according to the authors, it is more clinically beneficial to introduce CBT after a period of medication rather than to start both therapies simultaneously. This study is limited by the small number of subjects per condition (5–9 maximum), the duration of the treatment (5 months), and the absence of follow-up.Initial management of OCD relies on potent SRIs and CBT, used separately, sequentially or concurrently. 90% of patients can be helped with one or combination of these therapies [43].Unfortunately some patients do not respond adequately or at all to the initial treatment plan of CBT or SSRI or a combination of the two. The experts [36]recommend adding an SSRI when patients have not responded well to CBT alone. When patients have not done well with medication management alone, the experts suggest either adding CBT or switching to another SSRI. Thus, combined CBT and medication is the experts' preference for most patients who have not responded to an initial trial of either CBT or medication alone. In patients who have shown no response to combined treatment, the experts recommend switching SSRIs and continuing CBT. In patients with a partial response to combination therapy, they suggest switching SSRIs, providing more CBT, and possibly augmenting with another medication.Some patients are treatment-refractory, defined by the experts [36]as those who fail to respond to 3 sequential well-delivered SRI trials combined with expert CBT. A thorough clinical assessment of patients with treatment-refractory OCD is the first step in planning possible intervention. All DSM-IV axes should be thoroughly evaluated. These aspects include assessment of complications: Axis I (e.g., comorbid disorders); Axis II (e.g., personality disorders); Axis III (e.g., underlying medical disorder), and Axis IV (e.g., psychosocial stressors). In addition, the OCD symptoms themselves should be carefully assessed. Actually, there is some evidence that hoarding is more likely than other OCD symptoms to fail to respond to treatment [44, 45].There are a growing number of management options, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy augmentation, and alternative interventions for treatment-refractory OCD patients. The literature has somewhat less agreement about what to do in managing treatment-refractory patients. First-line recommendations are to add an augmenting medication, especially if the patient exhibits associated features (e.g., tics or a comorbid anxiety disorder) that might predict a positive response to augmentation. For example, it may be helpful to add an anxiety-reducing medication, such as clonazepam or alprazolam, in patients with high levels of anxiety; a high potency neuroleptic, such as haloperidol or risperidone, when tics or comorbid schizotypy are present. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting (e.g., using a partial hospital or inpatient behavioral unit to conduct therapist-assisted ERP), technique, intensity (additional CBT sessions or intensive CBT), or format (family or group therapy), or to switch to another SRI or a monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Pharmacotherapy augmentation included augmentation with serotoningeric agents, dopaminergic agents, and various other agents as well as alternative forms (e.g., increased doses) or routes (e.g., intravenous administration) of SRI administration.There are a variety of psychological factors, such as low motivation, negative expectancies for treatment success, procrastination, and noncompliance, that may interfere with response to ERP. In these cases, the cognitive component of OCD should be addressed more directly [46]. Obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions were studied as predictors of compliance with and response to BT in a controlled trial [47]. High scores on the hoarding dimension were more likely to dropout prematurely from the study and tend to improve less. BT is specially indicated for OCD patients with aggressive/checking, contamination/cleaning and symmetry/ordering symptoms. OCD patients with comorbid personality disorder should be treated by integrative CT [48].To better understand the causes of obsessions and compulsions, further work needs to be done to identify cognitive domains (beliefs and appraisals) that are specific to OCD. Some of the beliefs and appraisals identified by the Obsessive Compulsive Working Group [49]may be nonspecific, playing a role in obsessions, compulsions, and in many other clinical problems such as depression and generalized anxiety. Further work also needs to be done to identify the causes of important beliefs and appraisals. Advances in understanding OCD are more likely to occur if we can integrate the various methods of assessment [50]. There are also several challenges to be met in the area of OC spectrum disorders. First, the boundaries of the OC spectrum need to be better defined. More systematic research is needed on the relationship between OCD and various spectrum disorders, especially with respect to etiology, treatment response, and other theoretical important features [51]. Notwithstanding the growing evidence for the efficacy of CT or CBT in treating OCD, there is still little evidence that cognitive components of treatment add to the effectiveness of behavioral therapy [18, 52]. Perhaps we do not yet know enough about cognition in OCD, especially how to measure and modify them. A number of researchers have demonstrated that CBT produces a change in measures of beliefs considered relevant and/or specific to OCD. However, these studies are preliminary at this point, but nonetheless promising [53].The development of new models of OCD should help to understand and improve actual treatments, such as the model of perceived impulsivity and compensatory compulsivity [54].The experts [36]usually prefer to begin the treatment of OCD with either CBT alone or with a combination of CBT and medication. The likelihood that medication will be included in the recommendation varies with the severity of the OCD and the age of the patient. In milder OCD, CBT alone is the initial choice. As severity increased, the experts are more likely to add medications to CBT as the initial treatment or to use medication alone. In younger patients, the experts are more likely to use CBT alone. The experts consider the combination of ERP as the optimal behavioral psychotherapy for OCD, while CT may provide additional benefit by directly targeting distorted 'OCD beliefs' and/or by improving compliance with ERP.In managing treatment-refractory patients, the experts suggest a variety of augmentation strategies that can be tried in OCD, including clomipramine, clonazepam, conventional neuroleptics, buspirone, risperidone, and a second SSRI added to the first. The choice of augmentation medications would have to be tailor made for each patient. Clomipramine may be useful in boosting the response of a patient treated with an SSRI who is not having an adequate response. Neuroleptics may be helpful for patients who have not had an adequate response to an SRI and who have a comorbid tic disorder, OCD symptoms such as compulsive touching that resembles tics, or a comorbid schizotypy. Second-line recommendations are to try a new CBT setting, technique, or intensity, or to switch to another SRI or an MAOI. Finally, in patients with extremely severe and non-remitting OCD, intravenous clomipramine, neurosurgery, or electro-convulsive therapy (if the patient is also depressed) may sometimes be considered.The case illustrated in here represents a typical obsessive compulsive patient. We offered her a CBT effective in 20 sessions. The Yates-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score dropped from 29 at the beginning of therapy to 13 at the end of the treatment. This decrease represents a 55% efficacy. Results were stable for the 1-year follow-up. The overall strategies for treatment of OCD are presented in figure 1. On the basis of the evidence available, the following approach is outlined.The first step in treating OCD is educating the patient and family about OCD and its treatment as a medical illness. During the last 20 years, two effective treatments have been developed: CBT and medication with a SSRI. Education is crucial in helping the patients and their families learn how to best manage OCD and prevent complications. CBT is the key element of treatment for most patients with OCD. Medication with SSRI is helpful for many patients, especially for patients with depression. The BT (ERP) involved systematic exposure to the obsessions as well as prevention of any compulsive or neutralizing behaviors that might be used to reduce anxiety. ERP did prove to be a very successful form of treatment for OCD, especially for those with washing and, to a lesser extent, checking rituals. Outcome studies of ERP indicate that approximated 70–80% of OCD patients who complete treatment show significant symptom improvement [55]. CT, which may be added to BT, addresses such dysfunctional beliefs as faulty estimation of the importance of thoughts, exaggerated sense of personal responsibility and perfectionism often seen in OCD patients. CT may also provide additional benefits by improving compliance with ERP. CT may also be of value for the substantial number of refusers and potential drop-outs of BT. Because of well-proven efficacy and safety profiles, the SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for the management of patients with OCD. Patients who initially do not respond to SSRI therapy may benefit from switching to another SSRI or combining another medication or CBT with SSRI. There is evidence that addition of a neuroleptic may improve response to SSRI in some patients.Once OCD symptoms are eliminated or much reduced – a goal which is practical for the majority of those with OCD – then maintenance of treatment gains becomes the goal. When patients have completed a successful course of treatment for OCD, most experts recommend monthly follow-up visits for at least 6 months and continued treatment for at least 2 years before trying to stop medication or CBT. Relapse is very common when medication is withdrawn, particularly if the person has not felt the benefit of CBT. Therefore, many experts recommend continuing medication if the patients do not have access to CBT. Individuals with repeated episodes of OCD may need to receive long-term or even life-long prophylactic medication. The experts recommend such long-term treatment after 2–4 severe relapses or 3–4 milder relapses.The efficacy, acceptance and cost-effectiveness of short-term interventions for patients with OCD should certainly be further improved. The identification of factors which predict treatment response is a major goal. To effectively address the needs of individuals with severe and refractory OCD, current treatment strategies may need to be modified and supplemented. A promising area of research is the role of cognitive factors in OCD. Only the reports by Sookman and Pinard [48]have specifically examined the use of cognitive intervention with a difficult-to-treat sample of OCD patients. The apparent success of their cognitive treatment suggests that cognitive mechanisms could be involved in determining the severity or resilience of OCD. However, firm conclusions regarding the specific effects on cognitive intervention on severe or refractory OCD must await controlled studies.The authors wish to thank Emilie Aurouer for the English translation.'Case management' is a section which addresses biopsychosocial management of cases in clinical medicine.

To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

These neuropsychiatric sequelae have considerable functional consequences at the level of the individual, society, and the broader economy. Neuropsychiatric long covid symptoms are thought to be causally diverse, and a range of risk factors as well as biological, psychological, and environmental mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to symptom development and persistence. When present, objective cognitive deficits tend to be modest for most individuals, with some evidence suggesting increased risk of dysfunction and decline specifically for older adults with a history of severe acute illness. Longitudinal data suggest a delayed emergence of psychiatric symptoms may occur in the weeks and months after an acute covid illness. Emerging research points to the early recovery period as a potential window of opportunity for intervention to alter patient trajectories, though evidence based treatment remains lacking.",

Although sexual dysfunction is a neglected area of quality of life in patients with SSc, it turns out that it is an important issue for both men and women characterized by high prevalence. The etiology of sexual dysfunction in systemic sclerosis is multifactorial and includes factors associated with both physical and emotional (psychological) status. The most common physical problems in women are vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and vaginal tightness. Erectile dysfunction is not only a frequent but also often underestimated clinical symptom in men with SSc. The incidence of erectile dysfunction in patients with SSc ranged from 12 to 81% in different studies. The main psychological factors that may affect sexuality are depression, fear, and changes in the appearance of the face and body that usually leads to impaired self-esteem. This chapter is a review about the impact of systemic sclerosis on sexual functioning.",

Women living with psychiatric illness, despite their frequent sexual difficulties, consider sexuality to be an important aspect of their quality of life. Antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, the neurobiology and symptoms of the illness, past trauma, difficulties in establishing relationships and stigmatization can all contribute to sexual dysfunction. Low sexual desire is strongly linked to depression. Lack of subjective arousal and pleasure are linked to trait anxiety: the sensations of physical sexual arousal may lead to fear rather than to pleasure. The most common type of sexual pain is 10 times more common in women with previous diagnoses of anxiety disorder. Clinicians often do not routinely inquire about their patients' sexual concerns, particularly in the context of psychotic illness but careful assessment, diagnosis and explanation of their situation is necessary and in keeping with patients' wishes. Evidence-based pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available but poorly researched in the context of psychotic illness.",

      "title": "The Impact Of Menopause On The Musculoskeletal System: A Practical Overview",
      "abstract": "Key Points • Menopause is associated with a rapid decline in estrogen, which significantly affects bone, joint, and muscle health. • Bone loss accelerates during the menopause transition, with up to a 10% reduction in spine bone density within the first five years after the final menstrual period. • Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been shown to be effective in preserving bone density and reducing fracture risk. • Musculoskeletal symptoms, such as pain, stiffness, and joint discomfort are common and often underrecognized during the menopause transition, sometimes leading to misdiagnosis. • Foundational strategies for preserving musculoskeletal health during and after menopause include lifestyle interventions such as strength training, balance exercises, and adequate protein and vitamin D intake. Menopause represents an important phase in a woman's reproductive life, marked by the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, signalling the end of the reproductive years. In North America, the average age of onset is 50.5 years, generally occurring between the ages of 45 and 55. Hormonal fluctuations and symptoms of hypoestrogenism—such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood and cognitive changes—can begin up to 10 years before menopause, during the perimenopausal or menopause transition. These symptoms stem from fluctuations in sex hormones, primarily estrogen, which has receptors distributed throughout the body and impacts nearly every organ system, including the bones, joints, and muscles. In this review, we will summarize the effects of hypoestrogenism on bone, joint, and muscle health during and beyond the menopause transition.",

      "title": "The threshold problem of impairment criteria in psychiatric diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychiatric diagnoses are made based on careful ascertainment of cluster of signs and symptoms. However, just having symptoms and signs is not sufficient, these need to create problems to the person (or others around him/her) and manifest as distress or functional impairment. For example, a person may have third-person-discussing-type auditory hallucinations for over a month, but he or she may be able to attend to most social occasions and conduct the occupation as an agriculturist diligently. Similarly, individuals may present with symptoms of cannabis use disorder, but not manifest impairment of substance use disorder.[1] We argue that there is considerable heterogeneity in the conceptualization, practical ascertainment, and interpretation of functional impairment. This results in, at least to some degree, nebulousness of determining the threshold of psychiatric disorders.[2] Determining a threshold has implications in adjudicating the prevalence of psychiatric disorder, whether a psychiatric disorder is in remission, and whether a person needs treatment. We envisage three main reasons contributing to the threshold of psychiatric diagnosis. The first is the individual context of the person being interviewed for a diagnosis. A pilot experiencing sleep difficulties due to anxiety and missing a day of flight would be considered to have a diagnosis, whereas a college student missing a class in a month might not be considered passing the diagnosis threshold. The second is the social and cultural context of the person being evaluated. A person from rural parts of Punjab in India being extremely jocular and interrupting the therapist occasionally may be passed off as nonimpairing. A similar presentation of an individual from rural Tamil Nadu may be considered manifesting impairment associated with an affective illness. The third factor is the experience and expectations of the therapist. The therapist decides whether a person crosses the threshold or not. This may have something to do with how they appraise the information and what clinico-therapeutic experiences they may have had in the past. Since there is heterogeneity in determining the threshold of psychiatric diagnoses, there are a few suggestions to address the issue. One is acceptance of the subjectivity of the process of determining the threshold of diagnosis. One could determine kappa values of interrater reliability of impairment criteria. Interrater reliability of diagnoses and functional impairment assessment has been found to be acceptable, though not completely concordant.[3] The second approach could be greater recognition of contextual aspect in determining diagnosis and addition of an explanatory note on how social, educational, economic, political, legal, and other factors might have influenced determining threshold in a particular case. The third approach could be to put a-priori note during diagnostic evaluation process, when the diagnosis is being made and about in what circumstances or degree of functional impairment would the mental health professional not consider a psychiatric diagnosis or the diagnosis to be deemed to be in remission. To conclude, we do proffer that subjectivity exists in determining the lower threshold of impairment of psychiatric disorders, and being cognizant of this may help in rationally labeling an individual as having psychiatric disorder.

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "title": "Vulnerability to addictive behaviors: the Associational Memory‐Appetitive Systems Relations Model",
      "abstract": "The concept of behavioral addictions invites controversy, but is slowly penetrating psychiatric consensus. Any addiction involves five components1: a) existence of appetitive needs and b) repeated attempts at satiation of these needs through ingestion of a substance or engagement in a behavior (appetitive effects), followed at some point by c) preoccupation with obtaining appetitive effects (e.g., craving, tolerance), d) loss of control over time spent engaged in appetitive effect-related behavior (e.g., duration, relapse), and e) undesired or negative consequences (such as failure to meet work, familial and social obligations; suffering physical injury; emotional turmoil) resulting from continued engagement in the behavior2. The fundamental underlying perspective is that addiction involves disruption of appetitive functioning; that is, of behavior directed towards fulfilling specific human psycho-socio-biological needs3. It has been theorized that addictive phenomena operate through appetitive mechanisms involving, in part, a misleading, temporary subjective sense of neurobiological fitness4, 5. This experience may be identified through subjective changes in a) affect (e.g., feelings of joy, or merely improvement of affect), b) level of arousal (e.g., alertness or sedation/calm), or c) cognition (e.g., clarity, enlightenment, or decrease in tempo of stream of thought). One may learn to associate in memory the appetitive need (internal cue) with the contexts (location, time of day, situation) and behavior (e.g., sex, work) that led to its temporary subjective satiation, even though the result may not actually be biologically adaptive. The Associational Memory-Appetitive Systems Relations Model of addiction describes how appetitive motives may become excessive, atypically elicited, or misdirected5. There are four main components of this model. First, it is acknowledged that addictions (e.g., alcohol use) have a substantial genetic component (e.g., between 10 and 50% is accounted for by genetics). The model theorizes that one's appetitive needs are impacted by one's genetics. Individuals with a genetic predisposition to substance or behavioral addictions may have a different physiological reaction when engaging in certain behaviors (e.g., involving valence of subjective reward, dissociation of wanting and liking, or involvement of counteradaptation processes). The neurochemistry of an individual can potentially create an inclination toward maladaptive appetitive functioning. DNA epigenetic processes such as cytosine methylation may impact gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (part of an appetitive motivation pathway) subsequent to initial recreational drug intake and possibly involvement in other addictive behaviors. Prolonged periods of stress, particularly at a young age (adverse childhood experiences), may lead to disruption in brain reward cascade functioning. Such disruption, in turn, may increase one's vulnerability to addictive behavioral rewards. Second, the social and physical environmental settings that one traverses will impact what information one learns and how one thinks, and may facilitate which behaviors one may select to perform. Daily life social \"pushes\" (stresses, social influence) and \"pulls\" (seductions) provide possible avenues of addiction. For example, encouragement by peers to engage in drug use or marketing the \"excitement\" of local casinos may push or pull one to explore an addictive substance or behavior. Production and distribution routes of various addictive behaviors will impact what is available to the potential \"consumer\". Accessibility and awareness of nearby addictive behavior will impact which behaviors one will initiate. Third, one's lifestyle inputs also impact what behaviors may \"pop\" to mind in daily life. A child who grows up with parents who were engaged in addictive behaviors may be relatively likely to tie appetitive needs fulfillment to an addiction-related lifestyle through vicarious learning3, or else be quite wary to fall victim to such a behavior pattern. In addition, through vicarious experiences, one may learn the vocabulary associated with an addictive behavior (e.g., cannabis \"head high\" versus a \"body high\"). That is, one may be socialized and prepared at a young age for entrée into involvement with an addictive behavior later on. When one contemplates trial of an addictive behavior, it should be mentioned that acquisition skills are needed to be able to engage in the behavior with minimal conflict. This includes behavior-specific conversation initiation skills (i.e., knowing how to meet a \"supplier\" and acquire the addictive behavior; for example, arranging a purchase of cocaine, or time with a sex worker) and a means of exchange (e.g., money or favors for drugs). Involvement in different addictions may vary over the course of human development. For example, persons as young as three years of age may suffer from television addiction. Persons as young as eight years of age may become addicted to caffeine. There are many behaviors that could be experienced as appetitive and become addictive (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and other drug misuse; binge overeating/food addiction; shopping; electronic media-related; love and sex; workaholism; exercise; and gambling)3. A large minority or a majority of people have tried at least once engaging in various addictive behaviors (e.g., overeating, alcohol use, overspending). More-than-initial trial of an addictive behavior is partly a function of attraction to that behavior. Attraction-related variables include the social image associated with the behavior (e.g., mentioned in the recovery movement, of being \"hip, slick and cool\"), what one's peers are engaged in (peer social influence), as well neurobiological effects of engaging in the behavior. Fourth, it is through the process of associative learning that appetitive needs come to be subjectively satiated through adaptive or maladaptive behaviors. Associative learning and memory have been considered in several recent models of addictive behaviors. Cues in an environment that otherwise would be considered innocuous can stand out to be emotionally salient when influenced by motivational states6. These cues can range from eating behavior being triggered when seeing fast food sign cues or eating locations, or a drug user becoming excited or agitated when in sight of his/her drug of choice. Some individuals may not, through deliberate cognition, recognize that their decisional processes are being influenced by maladaptive or extreme reward cues. It has been proposed7 that appetitive motivation is controlled through a dual process of deliberate, conscious, executive, regulatory cognition interacting with relatively automatic, implicit processes, in response to addiction-related cues. Over time, in part due to relatively automatic prompting by multiple cues, one may experience excessive thoughts about and desire to perform a behavior. In turn, excessive time may be spent to plan and engage in the behavior, and possibly recover from its effects (e.g., from \"hangovers\"), and less time may be spent on other activities, despite diminishing appetitive effects1, 8. One is most vulnerable to initial and continued trial of an addictive behavior if the initial consequences are experienced as \"filling the gap\" in one's sense of well-being (i.e., of being satiated, fulfilled). A widely used saying within the recovery movement is that at first the addiction \"does something for the person\" and then it \"does something to the person\". In conclusion, appetitive needs are instinctually embodied in every human being from birth. For at least the past one hundred years, researchers have been exploring the parameters of appetitive needs in human beings9. The interface between one's genetics, social and physical environmental cues, lifestyle situations, development and adaptation (epigenetics and associative learning), and associative memory, may underlie addictive behavior. There is a lot to be learned from an appetitive needs perspective on what is at the root of an addictive process. Appetitive needs which might be explored include those of dominance/leadership, respect, being part of a herd, providing nurturance or being nurtured, and obtaining pleasure3, 5. More research is needed to explore a taxonomy of appetitive needs, and how different appetitive needs act as sources of vulnerability factors and may transform into specific addictive behaviors.",

      "title": "Premenstruális szindróma és premenstruális dysphoriás zavar.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája. A fizikai, mentális és magatartásbeli tünetek a ciklus lutealis fázisában jelentkeznek visszatérően, és életminőség-romlást okoznak a mindennapi életben, befolyásolva a páciens szociális, munkahelyi és családi kapcsolatait. A tünetekre jellemző, hogy pár nap alatt a menstruáció kezdete után spontán eltűnnek. A PMS és a premenstruációs dysphoriás zavar (PMDD) diagnózisa a következő kritériumok alapján állítható fel a Premenstruális Rendellenességek Nemzetközi Társaságának (International Society for Premenstrual Disorders – ISPMD) ajánlása szerint: a PMS esetében a nőnek 1–4 tünete van, amelyek lehetnek fizikai, viselkedési vagy affektív/pszichológiai jellegűek, vagy minimum 5 tünettel rendelkezik, melyek fizikai vagy viselkedési jellegűek. Ha viszont egy nőnek 5 vagy több tünete van, és ezek közül az egyik affektív tünet (például ingerlékenység, hangulatingadozás, düh) a fizikai vagy viselkedési tünetek mellett, akkor a pontosabb PMDD diagnózisa állítható fel. A diagnózisok megerősítéséhez az általános és a nőgyógyászati anamnézis mellett a páciens által naponta kitöltött prospektív skálák, például a menstruációs tünetek hatásának és súlyosságának prospektív nyilvántartása, továbbá a problémák súlyosságának napi nyilvántartási skálája jelent segítséget. A terápiás terv kialakításakor fontos figyelembe venni a tünetek súlyosságát, a nő fogamzási terveit vagy fogamzásgátlási igényeit, a társuló egyéb betegségeit és a korábbi kezelési módszerekre adott válaszát. A terápiás lehetőségek közé tartozik – a PMS és a PMDD súlyosságától függően – a rendszeres aerob testmozgás, a stresszoldás, a kognitív viselkedésterápia, a gyógyszeres kezelések (szelektív szerotoninvisszavétel-gátlók, kombinált oralis ösztrogén-progesztin fogamzásgátlók, GnRH-agonisták).

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting.

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "abstract": "El Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad (TDAH, en lo sucesivo), constituye uno de los trastornos del desarrollo neuropsicologico que en la actualidad afecta a mas ninos y adolescentes, se estima una prevalencia de en torno al 5%, segun el DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); y en el que coexisten diversos sintomas que van a ocasionar a la persona que lo padece serias dificultades para poder adaptarse de forma optima a los contextos en los cuales se ve inmersa. Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

      "abstract": "Poststroke depression (PSD) is a relatively frequent psychiatric comorbidity with prevalence rates ranging between 30% and 50%. Typically, PSD tends to occur between the third and sixth month following a stroke and may be identical to primary major or minor depressive episodes. However, some elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) with bilateral silent or overt subcortical strokes may present a different type of depression in which depressed mood is associated with cognitive disturbances with impairment of executive functions, psychomotor retardation, poor insight, and impaired activities of daily living. This type of PSD is known as vascular depression. Stroke and depressive disorders have a bidirectional relation, whereby not only are patients with stroke at greater risk of developing a PSD, but patients with a history of depression are at greater risk of developing a stroke. This relation is mediated by the existence of common pathogenic mechanisms operant in both conditions, which include anti-inflammatory processes, a hyperactive hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis that can result in a hypercoagulable state, as well as cardiac disturbances. The presence of PSD is associated with a worse recovery of activities of daily living, cognitive disturbances, and a higher mortality risk. Thus, early identification of PSD is of the essence so that treatment can be started without delay.",

      "title": "Case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency mimicking major depressive disorder",
      "abstract": "ISOLATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) deficiency is a rare pituitary disorder characterized by decreased secretion of ACTH, but not of the other hormones of the anterior pituitary and causes secondary adrenal insufficiency.1 Since isolated ACTH deficiency gradually and latently develops and shows non-specific symptoms, it is easily misdiagnosed. We report a case of middle-aged-onset isolated ACTH deficiency that showed a severe major depressive episode. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to suicidal behavior. He did not have any previous history of neuropsychiatric or endocrine disorders. From 6 months before the admission, he complained of mild general fatigue, depressed mood, loss of pleasure, psychomotor retardation, insomnia, decrease in appetite, and weight loss. He was diagnosed as having major depressive disorder. A dose of 100 mg/day of sertraline did not relieve him of his depressive symptoms at all. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious and showed a severe major depressive episode with suicidal ideas. He did not show any symptoms suggestive of atypical depression or chronic fatigue syndrome, such as hypersomnia, lead paralysis, mood reactivity, rejection sensitivity, muscle pain, lymph node swelling, and fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain did not show any structural abnormality, including an empty sella. Blood test revealed anemia (red blood cell count, 3.24 × 106/µL; hemoglobin, 10.0 mg/dL) and hyponatremia (117 mEq/L). Thyroid function studies were consistent with hypothyroidism: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 49.8 µIU/mL (normal range, 0.6–5.1); fT3, 2.45 pg/mL (2.47–4.34); and fT4, 0.71 ng/dL (0.97–1.79). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, antithyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, TSH-receptor, and antipituitary antibodies were negative. Both serum ACTH (<2.0 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2–63.3) and cortisol (0.2 µg; 3.7–19.4) were extremely low, whereas aldosterone (61.6 pg/mL; 38.9–307.0) was within normal range. Neither ACTH nor cortisol responded to corticotrophin-releasing hormone stimulation test, showing that he suffered from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone test, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test, and growth hormone-releasing hormone test showed normal responses, revealing that his secondary adrenocortical insufficiency was caused by isolated ACTH insufficiency. We discontinued sertraline and started to administer him 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone. Three days later, his symptoms mimicking major depressive episode were dramatically resolved. As in our case, isolated ACTH deficiency may be comorbid with primary hypothyroidism although the mechanism of the coexistence is unknown.2 However, the comorbid hypothyroidism did not seem to induce his depressive state as hypothyroidism was recovered 4 months after rapid relief of his psychiatric state. Relationships between glucocorticoid function and symptoms mimicking major depressive episodes are complex but might reflect insufficient glucocorticoid signaling. Some major depressive episodes might be associated with the insufficient glucocorticoid signaling by decrease of glucocorticoid production or decrease of sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.3 Our case suggests that isolated ACTH deficiency should be added into a differential diagnostic list of major depressive disorder.

      "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old woman affected by abnormal, excessive and involuntary reactions to harmless and unexpected sensory stimuli, compatible with the diagnosis of hyperekplexia. It is a pathology that involves the glycinergic system on a hereditary basis and, even if genetic proof compatible with the diagnosis is not present in this case, the fact that an aunt on her father’s side manifested the same disorders supports the clinical suspicion. From an early age, clinical history shows anomalous motor manifestations, initially framed as a form of focal epilepsy or ordinary disorders of the mood sphere, later excluded by the lack of effectiveness of a targeted therapy. Despite this, intellectual, psychological and socio-emotional development was regular. The manifestations, present throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in moderate entity, worsened after the age of 50 perhaps due to hormonal changes. The presence of consequent anxiety and depression has compromised her quality of life, and in order to improve it therapies were resorted which, however, involve cognitive-attention deficits. No diagnostic test has confirmed the diagnosis, although some scars in brain areas involved in the control of reactions are elements favorable to the condition in genetically predisposed subjects. Therapies currently in use attenuate the motor symptomatology without resolving it and cause side effects in the psychological and cognitive sphere. In this case, we want to highlight the difficulty of diagnosing a very rare genetic condition, still not well known and presenting symptoms which are easily confused with other more common diseases, in the absence of clinical-diagnostic tools at the present time.",

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

      "abstract": "Summary There are very few studies on the changes in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) treated with psychodynamic psychotherapy, around the world, and as far as we know, this is the first report in Mexico on this subject. The main features of this disorder appear at 18 years of age (75% females; 25% males) and are frequent crises characterized by impulsivity (physical figths, substance abuse, suicide or selfmutilating behavior), affective instability (episodes of depression, anxiety and anger) and alterations in identity (sudden changes in values, vocational or laboral goals) that consume a lot of health resources and contribute to many failures in academic and work performance. Its treatment always needs some form of individual or group psychotherapy, with medication at times. In most of the clinical settings this disorder is considered as untractable or to take years to produce beneficial modifications. According to the epidemiological studies of several countries, this disorder appears in 1.1 to 4.6% in the general population, in 10% of the patients in ambulatory mental health centers, in 20% of the hospitalized psychiatric patients and in 30 to 60% of the patients with personality disorders. In a clinical psychiatric population in the Central Military Hospital (Mexico City) the prevalence was 35.7%. This paper reports changes observed in the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder treated by therapists trained in the Kernberg’s manualized psychodynamic psychotherapy, delivered in two weekly 45 minutes sessions, videorecorded and supervised once a week by experts. As for the therapists that participated in the study, four were psychoanalysts with a mean experience of 12 years (D.E. = 1.15) and 10 psychotherapists with a mean experience of 4.67 years (D.E. = 4.23). The experience of both groups of therapists was significately different (U = 7.5, p,.002). Nineteen patients were treated: four males and 15 females who met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria. Measurements of the psychopathology and global functioning were made at the beginning of the treatment, and every 24 sessions during a two years period, using the Clarkin’s Dimensional Scale of the DSM IV Borderline Personality Disorder, and the DSM IV Global Assessment of Functioning. The results were: a) Eleven patients no longer met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria at the 72 nd session measurement, b) there was a positive change in the severity of the psychopathology in all criteria along time, c) the impulsivity criteria disappeared at the 24 th session evaluation; affective instability criteria almost disappeared at the 48 th session evaluation, while identity alterations criteria had only minimal changes even in those patients that remained in treatment for almost two years, d) the gaining in the Global Assessment of Functioning from the beginning to the 72 nd session measurement was 70% and, f) there were no significative differences between the type of therapist and the improvement of the patient in the measurements. These results should be replicated and contrasted with randomized and comparative studies between this type of therapy and supportive psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, group therapy and medication in patients of other social classes treated by residents in psychiatry and clinical psychologists before making available this therapy to a wider patients population.",

Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

Patients do not always present with obsessions or compulsions and this may complicate the process of diagnosing and starting adequate treatment. In this article three patients suffering from OCD but not presenting with obsessions or compulsions are discussed. In the first case, in a 42-year-old woman, the presenting symptom is a therapy-resistant dermatitis, due to excessive washing. The second patient, a 27-year-old man, presented with a depression, a frequent comorbid condition. In the third case, a 34-year-old man, the effects on and the suffering of the partner and family of a patient with OCD (they were asked to co-operate in his compulsive behaviour) were the reason for his wife to consult the general practitioner. OCD has a lifetime prevalence rate of 2.5% and is somewhat more frequent in females than in males. The most characteristic symptoms are obsessions and/or compulsions. They cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), and interfere significantly with the person's functioning (occupational, social activities, relationships). Neurobiological studies suggest genetic influences and dysfunctional neuronal circuits in the brain. The treatment of OCD consists of pharmacotherapy and behavioural therapy, but it is a lifelong condition.",

The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure.

The advancing multimodal therapies, while significantly improving the morbidity and mortality, have limited impact on psychopathologies, which often persist despite disease remission. The most common psychopathologies in acromegaly include depression, anxiety and affective disorders, together with sexual dysfunction, which may be considered as either a consequence or potentially even a contributory factor to these psychopathologies. Approximately one-third of patients with acromegaly manifest depression, whereas two-thirds of patients display anxiety, with both conditions tending to be more prevalent and severe in younger patients with shorter duration of disease. Apparently, a major impact of psychological discomfort in women compared with men appears to be the fact that women tend to internalize whereas men tend to externalize their distress. Personality disorders also commonly associated with acromegaly, especially due to body image suffering, are linked to sexual dysfunction, which seems to affect women more than men. In summary, psychopathology in acromegaly is a major determinant of the quality of life and a complex array of psychological abnormalities are associated with acromegaly.",

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression.

Suicide attempts were made by one fifth of this group of patients, and 6% committed suicide. However, three-fourths of the patients were well three-fourths of the time.

In addition to the classified clinical depressions, there is a considerable prevalence in the general population of depressive symptomatology and dysphoric states, apparently related to genetic factors, age, and stress.

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "abstract": "espanolLas depresiones en las personas mayores desencadenan una serie de consecuencias fisicas, funcionales, sociales, psicologicas, que pueden mantenerse en el tiempo, aun tras la mejoria de la sintomatologia afec- tiva. Se considera que en mas de las tres cuartas partes de los mayores deprimidos pueden persistir sintomas residuales, dando lugar a estados postdepresivos en forma de depresiones menores, depresiones subum- brales o depresiones subsindromicas. Entre estos sintomas residuales mas frecuentes en los estados postdepresivos destacan las dificultades de concentracion, el enlenteci- miento, la astenia, los sintomas somaticos, los trastornos del sueno o la hipocondriasis. En los mayores son mas frecuentes las de- presiones subclinicas o subsindromicas, que frecuentemente aparecen tras la mejoria de un trastorno depresivo mayor. Los factores que se asocian para la aparicion de estas depresiones subsindromicas son de tipo so- ciodemografico (ausencia de contactos so- ciales), empeoramiento funcional, historia previa de trastornos afectivos, antecedentes de trastornos vasculares cerebrales o facto- res existenciales (preocupaciones sobre el futuro, baja percepcion de salud,..). Este tipo de depresiones tienden a la cronici- dad y al deterioro funcional, y por tanto se recomienda el tratamiento de las mismas.

EnglishDepression in elderly are associated with somes factors like physical, functional, so- cial, and psychological consequences that can be maintained over time, even after the improvement of affective symptomatology. It is considered that in more than three quar- ters of elderly depressed may persist, giving rise to postdepressive states in the form of minor depressions, sub-threshold depres- sions or subsyndromic depressions. Among these most prevalents residual symptoms in postdepressive states are difficulties of con- centration, bradipsychia, asthenia, somatic symptoms, sleep disorders or hypochondria- sis. In elderly people, subclinical or subsyn- dromal depressions are more prevalent, which frequently appear after the improvement of a major depressive disorder. The factors that are associated for the appearance of these subsyndromic depressions are sociodemo- graphic factors (loss of social contacts), functional impairment, previous history of affective disorders, history of cerebrovascu- lar disorders or existential factors (concerns about the future, low perception of health, ..). This form of depression tends to chronici- ty and functional impairment, and therefore treatment is recommended.

      "title": "Cyclical Premenstrual Psychosis - Sometimes It Is Your Hormones",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Menstrual psychosis is a broad term used to describe a number of disorders characterized by the acute onset of psychotic symptoms with brief duration, complete resolution of symptoms between episodes, with timing related to menses. This entity was first described in the 18th century, with only 27 confirmed cases using strict diagnostic criteria. While research into causation is limited, estrogen withdrawal is thought to precipitate psychotic symptoms. We describe a case of premenstrual psychosis successfully treated with use of transdermal hormonal contraception and extended menstrual cycling. Clinical Case: A 25-year-old non-binary biologic female (they/them/theirs) with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and psychogenic non-epileptiform seizures was referred to endocrinology for evaluation of recurrent psychotic symptoms associated with menses. They endorsed stable mental health symptoms on aripiprazole except during the seven days prior to their menstrual cycle. During this time they reported persistent auditory hallucinations along with dysmenorrhea, with symptoms resolving at the onset of menses. Timing of menarche was uncertain, however they reported oligomenorrhea until beginning oral contraceptives at age nineteen, after which they developed regular monthly cycles accompanied by psychotic symptoms. Pituitary and ovarian hormone levels were unable to be assessed due to hormonal contraception. Prolactin was 8.3 ng/mL (3-30 ng/mL). In order to limit hormonal fluctuations from daily oral contraceptive pills and monthly withdrawal, the decision was made to transition to transdermal norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol patches changed weekly, with extended cycling to allow one menstrual cycle every three months. At follow-up visit nine months later they reported resolution of auditory hallucinations on this regimen, with symptoms recurring only during extreme stress. Conclusions: While the etiology of menstrual psychosis is unclear, described treatments include a combination of neuroleptics and hormonal therapy, including estrogen, progesterone, and GnRH agonists. As symptoms did not resolve until suppression of monthly menstrual cycles, this case supports the estrogen withdrawal hypothesis. Our case adds to the literature both in that transdermal, rather than oral or injectable therapy was used, and treatment was successful in alleviating the patient’s psychotic symptoms, improving their mental health and quality of life.

      "abstract": "The taking of a careful history in patients with exophthalmic goiter commonly yields three important facts: (1) Information to the effect that one or more blood relatives is or had been suffering with \"nervousness,\" exophthalmic goiter, or diabetes mellitus; (2) the patient has been of more or less \"nervous\" temperament, characterized by irritability, impatience, fractiousness, and emotionalism, usually since childhood; (3) the onset of the symptoms of the disease followed soon after the occurrence of a psychic trauma. From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

Emphasis is placed on a practical set of recommendations relevant to general practice.Comprehensive clinical history-taking, tailored physical examination and relevant laboratory testing can provide relevant clues for MSD diagnosis. Modifying lifestyle behaviours, managing reversible risk factors and optimising existing medical conditions are important first-line management options.

      "title": "SGCE Myoclonus-Dystonia",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SGCE myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE-M-D) is a movement disorder characterized by a combination of rapid, brief muscle contractions (myoclonus) and/or sustained twisting and repetitive movements that result in abnormal postures (dystonia). The myoclonic jerks typical of SGCE-M-D most often affect the neck, trunk, and upper limbs with less common involvement of the legs. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have additional focal or segmental dystonia, presenting as cervical dystonia and/or writer's cramp. Non-motor features may include alcohol abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and anxiety disorders. Symptom onset is usually in the first decade of life and almost always by age 20 years, but ranges from age six months to 80 years. Most affected adults report a dramatic reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. SGCE-M-D is compatible with an active life of normal span. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SGCE-M-D is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SGCE. Management Treatment of manifestations: Class 1 evidence supports the improvement of myoclonus and dystonia with zonisamide. Benzodiazepines (particularly clonazepam) and anti-seizure drugs used to treat myoclonus (especially valproate and levitiracetam) also improve myoclonus in individuals with myoclonus-dystonia. The response to other anti-seizure drugs (e.g., topiramate) is more variable. Anticholinergic medication may improve dystonia. Botulinum toxin injection may be especially helpful for cervical dystonia. Improvement with L-5-hydroxytryptophan, L-dopa, and the salt of sodium oxybate has been reported. Deep brain stimulation has improved both myoclonus and dystonia, with most targeting the globus pallidus interna (GPi); however, success with ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) target has also been reported. Other: Symptoms of SGCE-M-D often improve short term with ingestion of alcohol, but the risk of addiction recommends against its long-term use. Genetic counseling SGCE-M-D is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with penetrance determined by the parental origin of the altered SGCE allele: an SGCE pathogenic variant on the paternally derived (expressed) SGCE allele generally results in disease; a pathogenic variant on the maternally derived (silenced) SGCE allele typically does not result in disease. Most individuals with SGCE-M-D inherited the disorder from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have clinical signs of M-D (as phenotypic expression in the parent would depend on the sex of the transmitting grandparent). Each child of an individual with SGCE-M-D has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Almost all children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their father develop symptoms, whereas only ~5% of children who inherit an SGCE pathogenic variant from their mother develop symptoms. Once the SGCE pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "abstract": "A disfunção erétil (DE) é a incapacidade recorrente de obter e manter uma ereção que permita atividade sexual satisfatória, sendo a disfunção sexual que mais afeta os homens no envelhecimento. Estima-se que 50% dos homens acima de 40 anos apresentem essa disfunção. Como a prevalência é expressiva, torna-se necessária a realização de uma revisão da literatura sobre epidemiologia, fisiopatologia e tratamento acerca da DE, com o intuito de melhor compreensão da doença. A ereção é dependente de vários fatores como o relaxamento do músculo liso do corpo cavernoso, o aumento do fluxo arterial e a restrição do fluxo venoso de saída. Esses mecanismos podem estar prejudicados em várias doenças, sendo que, em alguns casos, a DE pode ser considerada como marcador precoce de problemas mais graves. Essa disfunção sexual apresenta várias etiologias: vascular, endócrina, neurológica, psicológica/psiquiátrica e relacionada às drogas ou às intervenções cirúrgicas. O próprio tratamento de algumas doenças de base pode ser a causa ou o agravamento da DE, como alguns anti-hipertensivos e antidepressivos. A principal explicação para a DE é a redução da disponibilidade de óxido nítrico, um importante vasodilatador. Contudo, fazem também parte de sua fisiopatologia a obstrução mecânica dos vasos sanguíneos e problemas de transmissão de estímulos neurológicos. A DE é primeiramente avaliada pelo método clínico, mas existem instrumentos avaliativos multidimensionais, sendo o Índice Internacional de Função Erétil considerado o padrão-ouro. O tratamento pontual para esta doença deve ser fundado na sua etiologia. Existem várias linhas de tratamento, sendo os inibidores da fosfodiesterase-5 e a psicoterapia (para DE psicogênica ou mista) os de primeira escolha, associados ou não à reposição de testosterona. Como segunda-linha, tem-se a injeção intracavernosa de substâncias vasoativas. Caso essas terapias não produzam resultado, a prótese peniana pode ser indicada.",

As alteracoes agudas do comportamento no adolescente sao muitas vezes associadas ao consumo de drogas, alcool ou medicamentos. Estas podem, no entanto, ser a manifestacao inaugural de uma psicose ou de uma doenca neurologica de origem infeciosa ou autoimune. Caso clinico : Apresenta -se o caso de um adolescente com desajuste subito do comportamento, de agravamento progressivo, semelhante a surto psicotico. A investigacao permitiu o diagnostico de meningoencefalite por Mycoplasma pneumoniae . Discussao / Conclusao : Este caso clinico vem reforcar a necessidade de uma abordagem alargada do adolescente com alteracoes agudas do comportamento. E fundamental manter a suspeita de patologia orgânica, investigando sempre a possibilidade de uma causa inflamatoria, infeciosas ou imunologica. O Mycoplasma pneumoniae e um agente essencialmente respiratorio, com potenciais complicacoes extrapulmonares, embora raras, sendo destas as neurologicas as mais frequentes.

      "title": "Orgasm phase dysfunctions in multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological condition for young adults in the United States, affecting approxi? mately 250,000 people. Sexuality and fertility are important concerns for this population since the onset of MS generally occurs between ages 20 and 40. MS is typified by lesions in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, particularly the periventricular region in the brain and the tracts of the optic nerves and chiasm, brainstem, and spinal cord (Adams & Victor, 1981). Nerve conduction in these areas may be entirely impeded, or impaired on a partial or intermittent basis. Consequently, MS produces a variety of symptoms that may change as disease activity fluctuates. Although studies of sexual function in MS patients have been limited, surveys of male patients reveal that 44% to 77% report unspecified difficulties in the orgasm phase of the sexual response cycle (Lilius, Valtonen, & Wikstrom, 1976; Minderhoud, Leemhuis, Kremer, Laban, & Smits, 1984; Valleroy & Kraft, 1984). Abnormalities in orgasmic sensation or ejaculation of semen can be detrimental to sexual pleasure and fertility. Most clinicians treating sexual dysfunction in men with MS have focused narrowly on erectile dysfunction, which is reported by 63% to 80% of men with MS (Goldstein, Siroky, Sax, & Krane, 1982; Lilius et al, 1976; Minderhoud et al, 1984; Valleroy & Kraft, 1984). Unfor? tunately, urologists and mental health clinicians often overlook orgasm phase dysfunctions when a patient seeks help for an erection problem (Schover & Jensen, 1988). Some men with erectile dysfunction can reach orgasm with a flaccid penis and would be willing to continue noncoital sexual activity despite impaired erections. For them, im? paired orgasm remains an important handicap. Others are candidates for a penile prosthesis or intracavernous injection therapy (Montague, 1988; Segraves & Schoenberg, 1985), but have unrealistic expectations that these treatments to enhance penile rigidity will also resolve prob-",

Despite their value in identifying and evaluating sexual dysfunction, screening tools and questionnaires should never substitute for a thorough sexual, medical, and psychosocial history. For patients with multiple sexual dysfunction symptoms following cancer diagnosis or treatment (e.g., ED and low libido), further evaluation of these symptoms is always recommended prior to initiating therapy for cancer or sexual dysfunction. Whenever possible, the temporal association or causal relationship between the symptoms should be assessed. The sexual, medical and psychosocial history is an essential element in the basic evaluation and should be obtained in all patients presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction. The essential components of sexual function assessment in the male should always include: erectile response (onset, duration, progression, severity of the problem, nocturnal/morning erections, self-stimulatory and visual erotic-induced erections), altered sexual desire, ejaculation, orgasm, sexually-related genital pain disorders, and partner sexual function, if available.",

      "title": "PROGNOSIS IN MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSES",
      "abstract": "A follow-up study of 208 manic-depressive conditions is reported. Analysis of such conditions permits the following summary. Positive heredity is common—chiefly depressions, and more commonly in the direct line of heredity. This shows more consistently in the manic cases. Characteristic personality type is outgoing. Unexplainable psychosis is rare (20 per cent). Most have disturbing circumstances at the time of onset. Oldest and youngest siblings may more frequently develop psychoses. Somatic handicaps frequently contribute to or help to precipitate the illness. Abrupt onset is rare except in manics. The condition usually requires one to six months to develop. Suicidal risk or attempt occurred in 30 per cent of all cases. The affective picture is often mixed, not purely as sadness or elation. Psychoneurotic (not often as anxiety), schizophrenic, and arteriosclerotic components are frequent (79 cases). (33.1 per cent). Thinking disturbances are present in one-fourth of the cases (manic and depressive phases). Capacity for rapport is fair or good in 41 per cent of the manics and in 70 per cent of the depressions. Some insight is present in 47 per cent of the manics and in 54 per cent of the depressions. Remissions of 10-20 years are common (67 cases, 32.2 per cent). Depression may begin early, but rarely (3.8 per cent, 8 cases), or late (65+, 11 cases, 5.2 per cent). The largest incidence occurs in the decade 45-55. Course is a matter of months; on the average 2½ months in the hospital. Three-fourths of the cases are well or improved at the time of discharge; 93 per cent recover from the first attack. Chronic cases are rare (16, 7.7 per cent). Cyclothymic cases tend oftener to chronicity. Single attacks are rare (21 per cent). Recurrence is likely. Long-term follow-up convinces us that caution is necessary in pronouncing recovery for the future. Seventy-nine per cent had recurrences. This is particularly true for cyclothymic cases. Many variations in course and phases occur. Depression following elation is more common than vice versa. Depression almost always lurks behind elation. Manic patients may suicide. Depressive or paranoid content occurred in 14 of the manic cases (77.7 per cent). Depressive cases may show definite manic features (spurts of elation in the morning, rhyming and flight with sadness). Single attacks of manic psychosis are very rare. Single attacks of depression occurred in 40 cases (19.2 per cent). Fourteen of these became chronic (35 per cent of 40 and 6.8 per cent of 208). The unfavorable depressions may develop a schizophrenic picture. Deterioration may occur in depression. Stupor in depression occurs—catatonic in appearance. First attacks on the average last 6½ months. Recovery from first attack is almost invariable (93 per cent). Twenty-one per cent had single attacks; 79 per cent had recurrent illnesses; 63.5 per cent had third attacks, and 45.1 per cent had fourth attacks. Attacks tend to become prolonged as they recur, especially after 45. Best prospect for recovery for patients having first attack is between 21 and 30, poorer after 40, worst after 50. Recovered patients show small number of attacks (2.7) and shortening of the course in subsequent attacks. The more frequent the attacks, the less chance for ultimate recovery. Depth of psychosis is not significantly important. Negative heredity is not an outstanding factor in recovery. Out-going make-up is a factor in recovered cases.",

Assessment of these case are often not straightforward, and their certification can be some of the most difficult cases that a forensic pathologist can be faced with in respect to the determination of both cause manner of death. Perceived unfair and/or unpopular certifications of these cases can result in professional criticism, allegations of bias, complicity or bias by certifying pathologist, social dissatisfaction/unrest and violent public protests.

      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

The prevalence of ED has been estimated as nearly 40% of men >40 years of age1 although these figures are contested.2 ED increases in frequency with age and is estimated to affect 15% of men aged 40–50 years, 45% of men in their 60s and 70% of men older than 70 years.3 Successful erection is a complex system involving reflex action (peripheral nerves and spinal cord), the limbic system (psychogenic stimuli) and the release of nitric oxide. Adequate levels of testosterone are required, and hence an intact hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular axis. Hence, ED can result from disease or treatment that produces hormonal deficiency, neurological impairment, problems with penile blood flow, disorders of tissue mechanics, psychological factors or any combination of these.\n\nLogically, ED secondary to testosterone deficiency should be treated by testosterone replacement. Testosterone levels in men decrease with age.4 Both epidemiological and observational studies have demonstrated that reduced testosterone is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. One meta-analysis showed lower testosterone and higher 17β oestradiol as significant risk predictors despite adjustment for age and body mass index.4 Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have been found to have lower testosterone levels than controls, and there is inverse correlation between testosterone and the incidence of major cardiovascular disease (CVD).4 A significant negative correlation has been reported between total testosterone levels and Framingham risk score.4 However, it has been pointed out that ‘It is unclear if this is a causal association or due to low testosterone being a biomarker of poor health’.4 Testosterone replacement as a treatment for …",

It takes an average of 17 years from the onset of OCD to obtain appropriate treatment. OCD tends to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Patients may be secretive or lack insight about their illness. Many health care providers are not familiar with the symptoms or are not trained in providing treatment. Some people may not have access to treatment, and sometimes insurance plans do not cover behavioral therapy, although the situation is improving. This lack of access or coverage is unfortunate, since earlier diagnosis and proper treatment can help patients to avoid the suffering associated with OCD and lessen the risks of related problems, such as depression, marital difficulties, and problems related to employment. 4 OCD may have a genetic basis. 5 Concordance for OCD is greater among pairs of monozygotic twins (80 to 87 percent) than among pairs of dizygotic twins (47 to 50 percent). 6 The prevalence of OCD is increased among the first-degree relatives of patients with OCD, as compared with the relatives of control subjects, and the age at onset in the proband is inversely related to the risk of OCD among the relatives. 5,7,8 There is evidence of a dominant or codominant mode of transmission of OCD. 9-12 the clinical problem",

Sexual adverse effects, mainly loss of libido and anorgasmia or delayed orgasm/ejaculation concern more than 50% of these patients. The antidepressive effects of treatment are generally satisfying, but the sexual side effects may be a reason for non-compliance. This article refers to studies that specifically have investigated sexual adverse effects caused by AD-treatment and strategies to handle and prevent these problems. A questionnaire sent to general practitioners showed that they are well aware of the problem with sexual adverse effect in AD treatment and ascribe it great importance. The knowledge of effects and side effects of newer AD drugs seemed somewhat insufficient. An increased knowledge about these substances and alternative treatment strategies would perhaps make it easier for the physicians to handle or avoid AD induced sexual side effects.",

      "abstract": "Parmi les problématiques psychiques susceptibles d’entraver ou de soutenir le traitement des conflits engagés par l’expérience du vieillissement et/ou du handicap, la question des identifications sexuelles se révèle nodale. En effet, outre la question identitaire, des assises narcissiques et de la différenciation moi/non moi, la question des identifications secondaires mobilisées par les différences des sexes et des générations se révèle être une dynamique majeure du rapport que toute personne peut entretenir avec son corps. Le vécu des limitations liées à l’expérience du handicap, et de celles, plus communes, liées à la traversée du vieillissement et de la vieillesse – qu’elles soient brutales ou insidieuses, aiguës ou chroniques –, entretient des rapports complexes avec les fantasmes de castration et de passivité. L’expérience de psychothérapies analytiques d’hommes qui, pour cause accidentelle traumatique (chute, accident de la voie publique), ou pour cause de fragilité somatique (accident vasculaire cérébral), se retrouvent en situation de handicap (avec des séquelles plus ou moins invalidantes) et vieillissent ainsi, permet de discerner combien la question des identifications féminines joue un rôle capital dans l’élaboration des conflits psychiques inhérents à cette rencontre entre vieillissement et handicap. L’auteur propose d’illustrer cette question clinique par l’exposé des grandes étapes de la psychothérapie d’un homme de 75 ans qui permet de saisir comment la rigidité puis la souplesse des identifications sexuelles, de la revendication de la puissance à la possibilité d’y renoncer au profit de l’acceptation d’une certaine passivité-jouissance, organisent, gênent ou élaborent le conflit psychique et, partant, les relations aux proches, aux enfants, aux femmes et aux hommes.",

Pain was most frequent in patients with neurosis and personality disorder. The occurrence of pain was significantly associated with unskilled work, but was not related to experience of social stress. Patients with pain reported more anxiety and hostile feelings and had a higher degree of somatic anxiety and muscular tension, thus attaching importance to anxiety‐induced muscle spasm as a pain‐mediating mechanism. A specific relationship between pain and depression was not supported.",

For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. At the age of 25, half will still have symptoms which continue to cause significant impairment. ADHD is associated with an increased rate of other disorders: mood disorders; anxiety; other behavioural disorders; autism spectrum disorders; tic disorders; specific learning difficulties; developmental co-ordination disorder and sleep disorders. The GP has an important role in identification of possible ADHD, and onward referral, and also in the management of ADHD post-diagnosis, particularly with respect to prescribing medication usually on a shared care basis with specialist services.",

Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological and clinical studies show that often persons affected by depression and schizophrenia can suffer of impairment of the sexual function. Most antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs have adverse sexual effects but it is difficult to identify if the impairment of the sexual function can be attributed to clinical picture or to the psychopharmacological treatments. Both antidepressants and novel and conventional antipsychotics are associated with significant sexual side effects and the presence of sexual side effects may affect compliance and adherence to treatment. In some specific clinical populations (e.g. youths), these specific side-effects turn out to be one of the most annoying and promote increased drop-out rates and poor adherence to treatment. Nevertheless, these clinical variables are often underestimated or not investigated in the course of follow-up of persons suffering from psychiatric disorders in treatment with psychotropic medications. Growing awareness of the adverse effects of psychotropic drugs has led to attempts to use adjuvants or substitute treatments to resolve sexual dysfunction. Effects on sexual function should be carefully diagnosed and treated; it should clearly discuss with patients in order to preserve an adequate quality of life, promote greater adherence to treatment and promote a good remission and recovery. The aim of this study is to review the most recent and significant literature data regarding association between sexual dysfunction and psychotropic medications, especially highlighting neurobiological and clinical data in order to improve the clinical pratice.",

      "abstract": "There are many conditions which, although not menacing to life or even to ordinary good health, are extremely distressing to the individual in the discomfort and disturbance of function and the general wretchedness which they cause. In this group of disorders perhaps none is more completely harassing than incontinence of anal control. Various conditions may result in loss of control of the sphincter ani muscle. Direct injury to the muscle itself from accident or operation, damage to its nerve supply anywhere along the course of the fibers from the cerebral cortex to the end-organs in the muscle, and certain congenital defects from which either the muscle or its nerve supply is defective are the principal types of lesions which result in incontinence of feces. For some of these conditions, efforts have been made in the past to repair the damaged muscle by suture or plastic operations of various sorts. Others",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction and Associated Psychiatric Comorbidities Impacting Quality of Life in Epilepsy: A Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Epilepsy is caused by dysfunction in the brain, which is characterized by an enduring disposition for unprovoked seizures that reoccur often, along with the neurological, cognitive, psychological, and social effects of the condition, which are often managed with prolonged and sometimes lifelong medications that involve antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). To confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy, at least two unprovoked seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart should be reported. This illness affects both children and adults. Patients with epilepsy are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction compared to the general population, which often leads to a poor quality of life. The pathophysiology involved consists of the impact of epilepsy and AEDs on the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, consequently resulting in a high risk of developing testicular or ovarian dysfunction, leading to sexual dysfunction in epilepsy patients. Aim: This review aims to highlight various studies focusing on the association of developing the risk of sexual dysfunction with psychiatric comorbidities, mainly depression and anxiety, that impact the quality of life in epilepsy patients. Methodology: The search methodology involved articles from the Google Scholar and PubMed databases published between 2018 and 2023. \"Sexual dysfunction\", \"epilepsy\", \"depression\", \"anxiety\", and \"quality of life\" were the keywords used to search the articles. The Boolean operator \"AND\" and \"OR\" were used in between the keywords used. Following this, a total of 15 articles were included in the review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conclusion: The review concluded that epilepsy patients are often affected by sexual dysfunction along with associated psychiatric comorbidities that mainly involve depression and anxiety, consequently impacting their quality of life, as demonstrated by various studies. Sexual dysfunction is a common yet underdiagnosed condition in epilepsy patients due to the stigma attached to it. Hence, neurologists must keep a high index of suspicion for this problem. Furthermore, screening and monitoring for sexual dysfunction should be added to the usual epilepsy work-up.",

This article reviews the pertinent literature, defines and describes postabortion syndrome (PAS) as a type of Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder. Four basic components of PAS are proposed: (a) exposure to or participation in an abortion experience, which is perceived as the traumatic and intentional destruction of one's unborn child; (b) uncontrolled negative reexperiencing of the abortion event; (c) unsuccessful attempts to avoid or deny painful abortion recollections, resulting in reduced responsiveness; and (d) experiencing associated symptoms not present before the abortion, including guilt about surviving. Clinical evidence and the cardinal features of PAS are presented, and objections to the validity of this diagnostic category are discussed.",

Symptoms associated with it may precede or follow the menopause, which is a single event during the climacteric, and they are therefore better called climacteric rather than menopausal symptoms. They include hot flushes; depression or emotional instability , sometimes with insomnia as the most prominent feature; and dyspareunia . Changes in libido apart from dyspareunia are often of psychological origin and are probably caused as much by ageing as by a fall in oestrogen production.

The pattern was of mild but typical depressive symptoms. Residual symptoms were more common in subjects with more severe initial illness, but were not related to any other predictors, including longer prior illness, dysthymia, or lower dose of drug treatment during the illness episode. There were weak associations with personality that might have been consequences of symptom presence. Residual symptoms were very strong predictors of subsequent early relapse, which occurred in 76% (13/17) of those with residual symptoms and 25% (10/40) of those without.",

      "title": "854 Sexsomnia in a Divorce Proceeding and its Custody Implications",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexsomnia is a NREM parasomnia under the subtype of Confusional Arousals, defined as abnormal sexual behaviors emerging from partial arousals during slow-wave sleep. Case reports suggest that is more common in men. Precipitating factors include Obstructive Sleep Apnea, insufficient sleep, alcohol and fatigue/stress and history of NREM parasomnias. Report of case(s) A 37-year-old male with bruxism (using mouth guard) and anxiety for 7 years, who presented to the sleep clinic for a second opinion to discuss concerns around the safety of his children due to his sleep related sexual behavior. Sexsomnia was first noted with the stressors related to becoming a parent (fostering children and having biological children). Sexual behavior reported by the couple was mostly provoked with spouse’s touch during sleep. Behaviors ranging from fondling to aggressive sexual intercourse were reported to occur 1 to 3 times/week. There were no injuries during episodes which only occurred in the bedroom with the spouse and the patient was amnestic of his behavior. Due to marital discord provoked by other stressors, he began to sleep alone in the basement. A video-polysomnogram revealed no parasomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep arousal disorders. Normal REM with atonia was observed. The patient was treated with Duloxetine 20mg for anxiety after the initial sleep visit. His condition contributed to marital separation. In the divorce proceedings, the spouse argued for denial of visitation rights related to his sleep-sexual behaviors noting that the children may be at risk. After separation, his anxiety and stress levels lowered in conjunction with therapy and medication. Follow up after 2 months found the patient asymptomatic. He placed an alarm on his bedroom door, to alert him and others during sleep. There are no published reports to provide a prediction as to whether his condition would-be supporting restrictions in overnight visitation by the foster and biological children. Conclusion In this case, there was a precedent condition (bruxism) and precipitating stress and anxiety, known to provoke NREM parasomnia. The absence of polysomnographic evidence is not unusual. Forensic repercussions, in particular prospective calculations of risk, are poorly described in the literature. Support (if any):",

      "title": "Estudio de la eficacia de un tratamiento psicológico breve en la disminución de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "El trastorno de panico se define como un trastorno en el que los ataques de panico presentan de forma inesperada y recurrente y al menos uno de ellos va seguido de un minimo de un mes de inquietud o preocupacion persistente por la aparicion de nuevas crisis o sus consecuencias, y/o por un cambio significativo y desadaptativo en el comportamiento que se relaciona con los ataques de panico. El ataque de panico se describe como la aparicion subita de miedo y/o malestar intensos que alcanza su maxima expresion en minutos y han de presentarse al menos cuatro de los trece sintomas fisiologicos y cognitivos descritos (APA, 2013).\nEn terminos generales se estima la prevalencia anual en Estados Unidos y varios paises europeos en torno al 2-3% en los adultos y adolescentes (APA, 2013). \nEl trastorno de panico conlleva un alto grado de deterioro de la calidad de vida e insatisfaccion (Comer et al., 2011; Barrera y Norton, 2009), mayor probabilidad de intentos de suicidio y suicidio consumado (Nepon et al., 2010), aumento de disfuncion cognitiva y emocional (Deckersbach et al., 2011), asi como con costes economicos y sociales sustanciales (Batelaan et al., 2007; de Graaf, Tuithof y van Dorsselaer 2012).\nLa terapia cognitivo-conductual ha sido ampliamente estudiada y es un tratamiento psicologico eficaz para el trastorno de panico (Hoffart et al., 2016; Kaczkurkin y Foa, 2015; Porter y Chambless, 2015; Sanchez-Meca et al., 2010; Arch y Craske, 2009; Hoffmann y Smits, 2008). La duracion promedio del tratamiento es de 12 a 15 sesiones, pero incluso los tratamientos mas breves han demostrado ser eficaces siempre que estos tratamientos mantengan los elementos centrales de la intervencion estandar (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Las dos formas principales de terapia cognitivo conductual desarrolladas para el trastorno de panico han sido el tratamiento de control de panico del grupo de Barlow (Barlow y Cerny, 1998; Barlow y Craske, 2000) y la terapia cognitiva del grupo de Clark (Clark y Salkovskis, 1989). Ambos tratamientos incluyen los componentes de psicoeducacion acerca del panico, reestructuracion cognitiva, la exposicion a las sensaciones corporales interoceptivas temidas y exposicion en vivo a situaciones temidas, pero dando mayor peso a la exposicion el grupo de Barlow y al componente cognitivo el grupo de Clark.\nAunque el tratamiento para el trastorno de panico ha demostrado un exito significativo, hay mucho margen de mejora, las tasas de respuesta inadecuada al tratamiento (Smits et al., 2012; Frentz et al., 2014; Gloster et al., 2015; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004) y la necesidad de tratamiento adicional permanecen altas (Arch, Wolitzky-Taylor, Eifert, y Craske, 2012; Casey et al., 2004; Bandelow y Ruther, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014; Landon y Barlow, 2004; Smits et al., 2012, Frentz et al., 2014). Por lo tanto, sigue habiendo una clara necesidad de nuevas estrategias terapeuticas, combinaciones de las ya existentes o bien, personalizar el tratamiento segun las caracteristicas del paciente, para aumentar las tasas de respuesta al tratamiento, especialmente entre pacientes refractarios.\nSi bien hay muchos tratamientos cognitivo-conductuales bien establecidos para los trastornos de ansiedad y el panico, la investigacion centrada en la mejora de los factores de riesgo permanece aun en una etapa incipiente (Feldner, Zvolensky y Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2007; Schmidt y Keough, 2010). En los ultimos anos se ha ido abriendo paso el interes por el estudio de los factores de riesgo para el panico asi como el desarrollo de intervenciones eficaces para el tratamiento de los mismos (Zvolensky, Schmidt, Bernstein y Keough, 2006). En el caso del trastorno de panico, se sabe que un factor de riesgo cognitivo es la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y que es una variable de diferencias individuales bien establecida que refleja una tendencia estable a temer las sensaciones corporales asociadas con la excitacion ansiosa (Reiss y McNally, 1985). \nPor otro lado, pese a contar con un gran numero de estudios donde se demuestra la eficacia de las terapias cognitivo-conductuales para el panico, estos se basan en paquetes terapeuticos que constan habitualmente de unas 12-15 sesiones (Taylor, Jakubovski y Bloch, 2015). Recientemente han adquirido especial enfasis los estudios de programas de tratamiento mas breves y facilmente aplicables en los servicios de Salud Mental a los que puedan acceder un mayor numero de pacientes (Deacon y Abramowitz, 2006; McHugth, Smits y Otto, 2009; Keough y Schmidt, 2014).\nHasta la fecha, la mayor intervencion centrada en la reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad se ha llevado a cabo por Schmidt et al. (2007) y Schmidt y Keough (2010). Ha sido realizada sobre individuos no clinicos con alto indice de sensibilidad a la ansiedad mediante los programas ASAT (Anxiety Sensitivity Amelioration Training) y el protocolo revisado ASERT (Anxiety Sensitivity Education and Reduction Training), consiguiendose una reduccion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad cercana del 60% en un mes de seguimiento comparado con un grupo control (Keough y Schmidt, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). \nEn nuestro pais no contamos con estudios donde se evalue la eficacia de tratamientos breves que tengan como diana terapeutica la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad aplicados en el entorno de un Centro de Salud Mental, sobre muestras clinicas.\nEl presente estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la eficacia en la disminucion de la sensibilidad a la ansiedad de un tratamiento breve (una sesion) con dos componentes (psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva) en pacientes con trastorno de panico con o sin agorafobia. Para ello se realizo un diseno cuasi-experimental de dos grupos de pacientes adultos (edad 18-65 anos) del Centro de Salud Mental de Pontones (Madrid) con trastorno de panico. El grupo experimental lo formaron 37 pacientes y el grupo control 39, con medidas pre, postratamiento y de seguimiento al mes y a los tres meses tras el tratamiento, a los cuales, al grupo experimental se le aplico un tratamiento basado en psicoeducacion y exposicion interoceptiva y al grupo control, un tratamiento-placebo basado en psicoeducacion general para la salud. A los pacientes se les administro en cada momento de la evaluacion el Indice de Sensibilidad a la Ansiedad que evalua el miedo a los sintomas fisiologicos, cognitivos y sociales de la ansiedad; la subescala Rasgo del Inventario de Ansiedad Estado-Rasgo que evalua un factor que comprenderia las diferencias individuales, relativamente estables, para responder ante situaciones percibidas como amenazantes con un aumento en la ansiedad (ansiedad rasgo) y la Escala de Inadaptacion que evalua en que medida el trastorno de panico afecta a diferentes areas de la vida cotidiana del sujeto como trabajo, vida social, tiempo libre, relacion de pareja y convivencia familiar, junto con una valoracion global\nLos resultados indicaron que el tratamiento basado el psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva disminuyo significativamente los niveles de sensibilidad a la ansiedad asi como la interferencia que el trastorno de panico producia en la vida de los sujetos, efectos, ambos, que el tratamiento-placebo no logro. Se observo tambien que el tratamiento experimental, asi como el control-placebo, no lograron cambios significativos en la variable ansiedad-rasgo. Los cambios observados aumentaron en el seguimiento.\nSe puede concluir que el tratamiento compuesto por psicoeducacion para el panico y exposicion interoceptiva se muestra eficaz para disminuir la sensibilidad a la ansiedad y el grado de interferencia que el trastorno de panico produce en la vida de los pacientes y que el tamano del efecto del tratamiento es grande y se incrementa con el paso del tiempo. La sensibilidad a la ansiedad como diatesis cognitiva para el trastorno de panico se ha mostrado como una diana terapeutica maleable en los pacientes con trastorno de panico. Sin embargo, el tratamiento experimental no se ha mostrado eficaz para disminuir la variable ansiedad-rasgo.",

      "title": "Psychosomatic Aspects of Urinary Incontinence in Women",
      "abstract": "Urinary incontinence in women is a common problem. With increasing age its prevalence and severity of its manifestations increase. Among nursing home residents the frequency is between 43 and 77 %, 6 to 10 % of all admissions to nursing homes are due to urinary incontinence. The risk for urinary incontinence among women with cognitive deficits is 1.5- to 3.4-fold higher than for women without mental disorders. The most common form is stress incontinence (50 %), followed by mixed stress-urge incontinence (40 %) and purely urge incontinence (OAB = overactive bladder, 20 %). With regard to its cause, the latter remains unclarified in about 80 % of the cases. It is often difficult to treat. There are also cases in which urge incontinence is related to traumatic events. In such cases behavioural and psychotherapeutic options may be helpful. Almost inevitably every form of incontinence has psychological consequences: shame and insecurity are often results of uncontrolled loss of urine. Among others, in the long term, they lead to the avoidance of social contacts and possibly to depression and isolation. Consideration of the psychosomatics is important in the therapy for female urinary incontinence from three points of view: 1) the efficacy of treatment is better suited to the patient, 2) the treatment costs are lower, 3) the professional satisfaction of the responsible physician increases.Harninkontinenz bei der Frau ist ein häufiges Problem. Mit dem Alter steigt ihre Prävalenz und die Schwere ihrer Ausprägung. Bei Bewohnerinnen von Pflegeheimen beträgt die Häufigkeit 43–77 %, 6–10 % der Heimeinweisungen erfolgen wegen Harninkontinenz. Das Risiko für eine Harninkontinenz ist bei Frauen mit kognitivem Defizit um den Faktor 1,5–3,5 erhöht gegenüber Frauen mit ungestörter mentaler Funktion. Die häufigste Harninkontinenz ist die Belastungsinkontinenz (50 %), gefolgt von der gemischten Belastungs-Drang-Inkontinenz (40 %) und der reinen Dranginkontinenz (ÜAB = überaktive Blase, 20 %). Letztere bleibt hinsichtlich ihrer Ursache in ca. 80 % der Fälle ungeklärt. Sie ist gelegentlich schwierig zu behandeln. Es gibt Fälle, in denen eine Dranginkontinenz im Zusammenhang steht mit traumatisierenden Ereignissen. Dann können zusätzliche verhaltenstherapeutische und psychotherapeutische Ansätze hilfreich sein. Fast zwangsläufig hat jede Form von Inkontinenz psychische Folgen: mit unkontrolliertem Urinverlust sind häufig Scham und Unsicherheit verbunden. Sie führen u. U. langfristig zur Vermeidung von sozialen Kontakten, und evtl. zu Depressivität und Vereinsamung. Unter 3 Gesichtspunkten ist die Berücksichtigung der Psychosomatik bei der Therapie der weiblichen Inkontinenz wichtig: 1. die Effizienz der Behandlung wird der Patientin besser gerecht, 2. die Kosten der Behandlung sinken, 3. die Arbeitszufriedenheit der behandelnden Ärzte und Ärztinnen steigt.",

      "title": "Prescribing for depressed adolescents: Office decision-making in the face of limited research evidence",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a relatively common, disabling, potentially life-threatening medical condition.1 MDD is diagnosed when there are five or more symptoms occurring over 2 or more weeks.2 Adult and adolescent symptoms of MDD are almost the same. However, irritable mood and lack of weight gain can qualify as depressive symptoms in adolescents.2 The lifetime prevalence of unipolar depression (MDD or dysthymic disorder) in adolescence is 11.7%; three-quarters of this percentage suffer severe impairment.3 Adolescent MDD has very high levels of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders.4 Depression is the condition most commonly implicated in adolescent and adult suicide.5 Adolescent depression runs a remitting and relapsing course, often recurring later in adolescence or adulthood6, 7 (see Fig. 1). Of those adolescents who recover from their depression, about 50% will have another depressive episode in the next 5 years.6, 8 In summary, adolescent MDD is a serious and sometimes chronic medical condition that requires assertive treatment. Course of adolescent major depression. *No depressive symptoms for over 2 months. A number of antidepressants have come onto the market since 1987 that provide fewer side effects at therapeutic dose and in overdose than the older tricyclic antidepressants.9, 10 These newer agents include the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram), the serotonin–norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) and the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine). The prescribing of antidepressants to children and adolescents has increased from 1996 to 2007.11 Overall, 19% of Australian paediatricians and 68% of child psychiatrists self-report prescribing SSRIs.12 However, this is very unlikely to be specifically for major depression, as paediatricians prescribe across a broad variety of diagnoses and at times for off-label conditions. The SSRIs are a class of antidepressant that have a high affinity for blocking the presynaptic serotonin transport proteins but not the other monoamine transmembrane transport proteins.13 SSRIs differ in their effects through secondary binding to non-serotonergic receptors,14 the antidepressant effects of their metabolites, their excretion half-lives and their effect on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.15 Despite their differences, the available SSRIs are all effective treatments for moderate adult depression16 and display similar overall side effect profiles.15 In 2004, evidence emerged from antidepressant trials conducted by pharmaceutical companies that there was an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviours in children and adolescents given antidepressants. In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered that pharmaceutical companies add a ‘black box’ warning on all antidepressant medication warning of the heightened risk of suicidality.17 There have been several key guidelines, meta-analyses and papers published since the FDA black box warning that have added further information in an attempt to clarify the role of antidepressants in the treatment of depressed adolescents. Despite the increasing amount of information available, it is our contention that the available literature remains limited and at times contradictory about prescribing. A selective review of the key papers is provided with a discussion on the implication for practice-based management of depressed adolescents. The association of antidepressants and suicidal behaviour in adolescents is discussed elsewhere.18 Do antidepressant drugs work at all in adolescent depression? There is universal agreement that tricyclic antidepressants have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. A Cochrane meta-analysis found that there was no difference in the rate of recovery in children and adolescents with depressive disorder between those given tricyclic antidepressants and those given placebo treatments.19 The randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English peer-reviewed journals for the treatment of adolescent or combined adolescent/child depression (n = 14) are shown in Table 1. The majority of the studies were industry-funded and were conducted in North America. Unpublished and non-English-language studies on nefazodone, citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine and mirtazapine have been noted elsewhere.34-37 Fluoxetine is the drug with the most consistent positive response, in three out of the four studies. On the basis of evidence of efficacy from RCTs, the FDA has approved both fluoxetine, in 2003,38 and escitalopram (the active enantiomer of citalopram), in 2009, for use in adolescent depression.39 While seven studies show superiority of drug over placebo, the reported findings from some of the studies have been queried since publication. A study of sertraline by Wagner et al. (2003) that reported positive results had in fact pooled two studies with the same methodology.25 When each of the sertraline studies is taken on its own there is no significance in either study.18 Jureidini (2008) noted that the significant difference between paroxetine and placebo reported by Keller et al. (2001) was found using measures not cited in the original protocol (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression depressed mood item, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia – Lifetime depressed mood item, Clinical Global Impression).40 It is possible that the outcomes reported from each of the RCTs may be influenced by the variables related to the study design, medication compliance, placebo response rate and the nature of the cohort recruited.37, 41-43 The differences between the studies restrict direct comparison of their reported findings. The limitations of single RCTs point us to systematic reviews with meta-analyses that have the capacity to pool data and address the problem of small sample sizes.44 An early meta-analysis (n = 5 RCTs) reported a small effect size for antidepressants over placebo, with suggested negligible clinical benefit.45 Tsapakis et al. (n = 29 RCTs including tricyclics) reported an overall number needed to treat (NNT) of 9, with a higher response rate in adolescents compared with children.46 Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry (n = 12 RCTs)47 and Whittington et al. (n = 5 RCTs)48 reported a modest benefit for fluoxetine over placebo. In summary, these meta-analyses found small effect sizes that have been interpreted as reflecting limited to negligible clinical improvement. The most recent Cochrane review (n = 19 RCTs) of 3335 participants treated with newer antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, mirtazapine, venlafaxine)35 found a small statistically significant difference in response/remission favouring antidepressants over placebo, but this finding was qualified as being not clinically meaningful.35 Other authors came to different conclusions. Bridge et al. (n = 15 RCTs) found in their meta-analysis that the NNT for antidepressants in children and adolescent MDD was 10 but advocated for ‘the cautious and well monitored’ use of antidepressants.37 Other techniques have been used to assess antidepressant efficacy. Gibbons et al. (2012) pooled all the data from each participant in the fluoxetine RCT studies (n = 708) over the first 6 weeks of treatment, arguing this approach was superior to a meta-analysis as it utilised all the data available.49 Gibbons et al. found that using fluoxetine compared with placebo, the NNT for response to treatment was 4.49 Higher response and remission rates were reported for fluoxetine in depressed youth than adults.49 The overall findings suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine and less evidence for that of other antidepressants in the short term. The various complex analyses, in the main, have been confusing, as different authors have argued for exclusion of selected RCTs from analysis depending on their orientation.46, 50, 51 Further, meta-analysis itself is not an exact science and is open to some interpretation depending on which studies are included, the quality of the studies and the nature of the statistical analysis (fixed-effects vs. random-effects regression).37, 52 Some studies that have compared combined cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication treatments to monotherapeutic approaches for adolescent depression have shown differences in the relative efficacy of CBT, antidepressants or combination after 3 months.31, 53 However, there is convergence in efficacy across all the treatments (medication vs. CBT vs. combination) in the subsequent months53, 54 and years.8 In a meta-analysis of five RCTs, antidepressants (predominantly fluoxetine) have been shown to be equivalent to a combination of antidepressant and CBT at 26 and 36 weeks' follow-up.55 These findings challenge the assumption that two treatments are ultimately better than one. In contrast, for adolescents with MDD who do not respond to the initial SSRI, changing to another antidepressant (SSRI or venlafaxine), especially in conjunction with CBT, has been shown to result in an improvement in depressive symptoms in half of patients.56 In this treatment-resistant group the change to a combination of CBT and antidepressant or another antidepressant led to 38.9% achieving remission at 24 weeks.57 RCTs of antidepressant efficacy have typically aimed to examine short-term outcome (2 to 3 months). Adolescent depressive disorder runs a relapsing, remitting course into early adulthood.6 There have been two placebo-controlled studies of children and adolescents with MDD looking at relapse prevention.58, 59 Over 32 weeks' (n = 40) and 6 months' (n = 102) follow-up of patients who remitted from MDD, fewer patients relapsed on fluoxetine than placebo, and those on placebo relapsed more quickly than those on fluoxetine,58, 59 providing preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of fluoxetine in reducing risk of MDD relapse. Kennard et al. conducted a pilot study of adolescents with MDD (n = 46) who had responded to fluoxetine, randomising them to CBT and fluoxetine or fluoxetine only over the next 6 months.60 Those adolescents who were given CBT and fluoxetine were eight times less likely to relapse than those who received medication alone.60 There is early evidence that in the continuation phase of treatment (6 to 12 months after the acute phase), there is a role for antidepressant and possibly CBT prophylaxis to prevent relapse. Depression in children and adolescents is associated with parental depression.61 This association is likely to be mediated by genetic susceptibility; exposure to parental depressive emotions, cognitions and behaviours; and increased familial stresses. Intervention studies to treat depressed parents have largely focused on maternal depression.62 For depressed adolescents whose mothers are concurrently depressed, treating the mother's depression has been shown to improve internalising disorders in their offspring.63 This improvement continues at 12-month follow-up.64 These studies, taken together, point to the importance of looking at the whole family system and not just treating the adolescent in isolation. There are several clinical practice guidelines that incorporate these research findings and expert opinion to assist paediatricians in the management of the depressed adolescent. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care treatment (GLAD-PC) were published in 2007,65 the beyondblue Clinical Practice Guidelines were released in 2010,66 and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines were released in 200567 and updated in 2011 without change. The NICE guidelines recommend that children and adolescents with moderate to severe depression should be offered, as first-line treatment, CBT, interpersonal therapy or short-term family therapy of at least 3 months' duration. Antidepressants should only be prescribed if the adolescent has moderate to severe depression, is assessed by a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services tier 2 or 3 professional and is receiving concurrent psychological treatment. The beyondblue guidelines recommend that fluoxetine should be considered for reduction of depressive symptoms in the short term where psychological treatment has failed, is inaccessible or is refused.66 The GLAD-PC guidelines recommend using an SSRI for moderate to severe depression, outlining dosing regiments for six different SSRIs.65 The NICE guidelines appear to be the most conservative in their recommendations and the GLAD-PC the most liberal. The recommendation for the use of antidepressants in the short term by the beyondblue guidelines is in line with the evidence base, which, in the main, has investigated short-term outcomes of depression. A number of factors limit the clinician's ability to apply RCT findings in his or her practice.68 The RCTs described use placebos, are short-term and are not representative of those depressed adolescents who present in the clinician's office. Hetrick, McKenzie and Merry reported that the children and adolescents in RCTs were unlike those who presented for treatment, who were suffering with lower levels of comorbidity and suicidality.47 The paediatrician often sees patients who would be excluded from most of the adolescent depression RCTs. For instance, there is scant information about the assessment of use of antidepressants in those with MDD and developmental disability,69 leaving them therapeutic orphans. Further, the clinician does not have the option of using a placebo. If the likelihood of a short-term response is 61% on an antidepressant,37 where does that leave the prescribing clinician? It is very likely that many clinicians will consider trialling an SSRI. Seligman (1998) has made the point that the aims of clinical trials overlap with those of the practicing clinician, but they are not the same thing. Seligman notes that clinical trials are largely short-term, single-intervention studies, usually focusing on a single outcome (e.g. reduction in depressive symptoms).70 By contrast, clinical work is, in the main, a long-term engagement, involving multiple treatments that are self-correcting.70 The decision to medicate, while guided by the available research, is also directed by the adolescent's severity of symptoms, unique strengths and vulnerabilities, family factors, access to mental health services and individual wishes of the patient and his or her parents. The paediatrician is well placed to integrate all these factors. The treatment guidelines for adolescent depression suggest that the role of antidepressants is as a second-line treatment for moderate to severe depression as part of stepped treatment where there has been inadequate response to psychological therapies. Of the antidepressants, fluoxetine has the strongest evidence of efficacy; however, the evidence is largely short-term. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that fluoxetine can prevent relapse. Tricyclics have no role in the treatment of adolescent depression. CBT may be added to an antidepressant; however, evidence of an additive effect is limited. Effectiveness studies are largely unavailable, and treatment response rates may vary in clinical practice. If an adolescent and his or her mother are both depressed, then both are likely to benefit if the mother is the one who takes and responds to an antidepressant.",

      "abstract": "A number of patients with schizophrenia suffer from drug-related sexual and endocrine problems. Questionnaire\nstudies suggest that 40-60% of the patients report sexual dysfunctions. Sexual dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia\nseems to be associated with the disease itself, psychosocial factors, medical health, as well as to the use of\nantypsychotics. Many of the conventional or typical antipsychotics have been associated with sexual dysfunction,\nsuch as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmia, delayed or retrograde ejaculation, oligomenorrhoea, and\namenorrhoea. The contemporary literature hardly gives any information on systematic studies on the frequency and\nquality of sexual functioning in patients with schizophrenia. The limited information available suggests that some\nantipsychotics often induce sexual side effects and comparative studies are almost completely absent. The underlying\nmechanisms of sexual side effects induced by antipsychotics are only partly known. Several mechanisms contribute to\nthe effects of antipsychotics on sexual functioning. Dopamine seems to be involved in almost all aspects of sexual\nbehaviour and antipsychotics induced dopamine blockade playing a role in the impairment of all stages of sexual\nperformance. The prolactin elevation associated with dopamine blockade interferes with erection as well as with\nother aspects of sexual performance in a dose dependent manner. Also some antipsychotics induce noradrenergic\nblockade, which is associated with disturbances in ejaculation and possibly lubrication. In addition serotonergic,\nhistaminergic and hormonal effects contribute to the actual sexual performance. The aim of this paper is to depict the\nmechanisms underlying the sexual dysfunction associated with antipsychotic treatment.",

      "title": "A Case of Musical Hallucinations in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aims: New onset psychosis in the elderly is rare with lifetime prevalence rates of 0.3–1%. Schizophrenia occurs in 0.1–0.5% of the elderly, however more common causes of new onset psychosis include dementia, delirium, drug-induced psychosis, and primary psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression. More than 50% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience psychotic symptoms and 70% develop delusions, in particular, persecutory type. Visual hallucinations are the most common type of hallucination occurring in 80% of patients with Lewy Body dementia. Second person auditory hallucinations occur in schizophrenia-like psychosis, however musical hallucinations where one perceives music without an external source are rare. Methods: An 84-year-old female patient with no psychiatric background reported a 2-month history of musical hallucinations, causing distress and poor sleep. Patient denied hearing voices and other modalities of hallucinations. The musical hallucinations were not lateralised to either ear or side of space but experienced as external. Delirium was ruled out and patient’s medications were screened for anticholinergics and sedative-hypnotics. Patient had good cognition and a CT head excluded organic causes. The patient appeared distracted by the musical hallucinations, however, was not agitated and her mood was euthymic with congruent affect. No evidence of mood disorders ruled out psychotic depression and other affective disorders with psychotic symptoms. No thought disorders or delusions were present. Antipsychotics quetiapine and amisulpride proved no benefit for the patient. Results: The patient’s presentation showed no clear reversible pathology and was unresponsive to antipsychotics. Musical hallucinations was given as a diagnosis of exclusion. A musical hallucination is a type of auditory hallucination involving the perception of music without an external source. Patients are usually female, over 60 and subdivided into those with hyperacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy and intoxication. Our patient was female and over 60 with presbycusis. Musical hallucinations are proposed to be due to abnormal autonomous activity in the auditory brain systems responsible for normal music imagery. Sensory auditory deprivation or acquired peripheral deafness leads to impoverished auditory input and spontaneous activity occurs within the network for the perception and imagery of music. Conclusion: This case report describes a rare phenomenon of musical hallucinations in an elderly patient. It identifies important diagnoses to exclude including delirium, dementia and other organic causes. The patient was female, over 60 yrs and diagnosed with presbycusis, characteristic of patients with musical hallucinations. The patient showed no improvement with antipsychotics and so treatment consisted of psychoeducation.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

Sleep, however, is a fragile state that can easily be impaired by psychological stress or physical illness. For up to 10% of the general population, difficulty falling and/or maintaining sleep occurs several times a week (i.e., chronic insomnia). Some of these problems may be due to existences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition that affects over 10% of the population, or due to restless leg syndrome (RLS)/periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), sleep-related involuntary leg movements often associated with an abnormal sensation in legs. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common. Narcolepsy is a primary EDS disorder affecting about 0.05% of the population. EDS is also often secondary to a severe insomnia associated with obstructive sleep apnea.",

      "title": "Postconcussion Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "abstract": "Il DSM-IV definisce il disturbo da desiderio sessuale ipoattivo(DDSI) come una persistente o ricorrente carenza (o assenza) di fantasie sessuali e desiderio per attivita sessuale causa di disagio o difficolta interpersonali. Il testosterone (T) e la prolattina (PRL) sono i piu importanti\r\nfattori ormonali implicati nel controllo del desiderio sessuale. In quest’articolo descriviamo come altri fattori psico-biologici, individuati attraverso l’utilizzo dell’intervista strutturata SIEDY, siano associati al DDSI in un campione di pazienti maschi che si rivolgono ad un ambulatorio andrologico riportando un disturbo della sessualita. Diversi fattori relazionali (riduzione della capacita orgasmica e libidica della partner come percepita dal paziente, presenza di malattie nella partner, relazioni prolungate e conflittuali) e stressogeni ambientali\r\n(soddisfazione sul lavoro e/o presenza di conflittualita familiare) sono risultati significativamente associati con il DDSI. Tra i fattori ormonali, una iperprolattinemia severa (>700 mU/l), sembra giocare un ruolo maggiore rispetto all’ipogonadismo (testosterone < 12 nM) sulla\r\npatogenesi del DDSI (RR= 7.5 [2.5-22.4] vs 1.5 [1.1-1.9], rispettivamente). La presenza di disturbi psichiatrici maggiori o l’utilizzo di farmaci con impatto potenzialmente negativo sulla funzione sessuale sono altri parametri associati al DDSI cosi come la presenza di sintomi\r\nd’ansia e depressivi. In conclusione, il DDSI e associato a diversi fattori organici, intrapsichici e relazionali che possono essere simultaneamente individuati attraverso l’utilizzo di SIEDY.",

The risk of recurrence is higher in the presence of neurologic or electroencephalographic abnormalities or if the seizure is partial as opposed to generalized. Neurologic abnormalities and partial seizures also reduce the probability of remission. Gradual drug withdrawal can be considered if the patient has been in remission for 2 years in the absence of any negative prognostic indicators.When deciding whether to begin or discontinue antiepileptic drug therapy, clinicians should consider the risks and possible benefits for the individual patient.",

      "abstract": "Peyronie's disease (PD) is characterized by the formation of palpable fibrotic tissue in the tunica albuginea of the penis. It is thought to manifest in response to recurrent microtrauma during erection in those with risk factors that may include wound-healing disorders. The initial stage of PD is thought to last from 6 to 18 months, and it is characterized by an inflammatory period with pain in approximately one-third of men. This initial phase is followed by a chronic phase when pain typically resolves and the deformity stabilizes with no additional plaque development. PD has been reported to develop in up to 9% of adult males according to published literature, but the incidence may be even higher. The most frequently affected age group is men between 50 and 59 years. Because of the associated penile deformity and effect on sexual relations, psychosocial distress is very common in those with PD. It has been reported to negatively affect self-image, sexual activity, intimacy, and mood, and it is often associated with depression and erectile dysfunction (ED). At this time, nonsurgical treatments are unreliable and have variable efficacy, and surgical treatments are reserved for those with disabling disfigurement. Moreover, surgery may result in loss of penile length and ED, and there are only a few physicians in the United States that perform such surgeries. There is a great need to increase awareness of PD in patients and general practitioners, to elucidate the pathogenesis of PD, and for the development of novel treatments for this disfiguring disease.",

When any or all of these factors are disrupted by a progressive dementia it is unsurprising that sexual ‘problems’ are identified. Most sexual behaviour ‘problems’ relate to expressions of normal sexuality complicated by changes in relationships, care needs and cognitive function, and complex ethical and legal considerations emerge. Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium. Evidence and approaches to assess and to manage sexual behaviour problems in dementia are discussed.",

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

Single episodes were included when they lasted for a minimum of 1 day. EPC with Rasmussen syndrome and acute stroke were excluded.Three time courses with two subtypes each were distinguished, that is, EPC as a solitary event (de novo or in preexistent epilepsy); chronic repetitive nonprogressive EPC (with frequent or rare episodes); and chronic persistent nonprogressive EPC (primarily or evolving out of an episodic course). These were unrelated to etiologies (morphologic lesions 34%, inflammatory 29%, systemic disorders 9%, idiopathic 5%, unknown 23%). Precipitation and inhibition of seizures is a frequent feature of EPC. Levetiracetam and topiramate have improved the possibilities for pharmacotherapy. Topiramate seems to be particularly effective with dysontogenetic etiologies.The existence of several clearly distinct courses of nonprogressive EPC is a new finding. These distinctions will be further investigated in a prospective study with precise protocols for electroencephalography (EEG), imaging, and other studies. This should better establish the relation of motor and somatosensory EPC; further clarify the relations, pathogenesis, and significance of the different types and their etiologies; and possibly identify more semiologic variants. It should also provide more precise knowledge about therapy and modification of ictogenesis by external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The aim of this article is to review recent epidemiological research on age-of-onset of mental disorders, focusing on the WHO World Mental Health surveys. Recent findings Median and inter-quartile range (IQR; 25th–75th percentiles) of age-of-onset is much earlier for phobias (7–14, IQR 4–20) and impulse–control disorders (7–15; IQR 4–35) than other anxiety disorders (25–53, IQR 15–75), mood disorders (25–45, IQR 17–65), and substance disorders (18–29, IQR 16–43). Although less data exist for nonaffective psychosis, available evidence suggests that median age-of-onset is in the range late teens through early 20s. Roughly half of all lifetime mental disorders in most studies start by the mid-teens and three quarters by the mid-20s. Later onsets are mostly secondary conditions. Severe disorders are typically preceded by less severe disorders that are seldom brought to clinical attention. Summary First onset of mental disorders usually occur in childhood or adolescence, although treatment typically does not occur until a number of years later. Although interventions with early incipient disorders might help reduce severity-persistence of primary disorders and prevent secondary disorders, additional research is needed on appropriate treatments for early incipient cases and on long-term evaluation of the effects of early intervention on secondary prevention.",

The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

Typically, compulsive sexual behaviors are characterized by the failure to resist the urge for a given sexual behavior, which is frequently followed by feelings of guilt, regret, and self-reproach, leading to their inclusion in the spectrum of impulse control disorders. The treatment of compulsive sexual behaviors is challenging, with reports of varying success for several psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics.",

      "title": "Management of Recurrent Depression in Primary Care",
      "abstract": "The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a major depressive episode of recent onset. She had 2 previous episodes 1 and 3 years earlier, which had been treated by her primary care physician with fluoxetine for 6 months each time. There is no evidence of bipolar illness. She wants to know which treatment is right for her at this point.Major depressive disorder is a highly prevalent condition in the general population. Its chronic and recurrent nature is getting increasing attention [1]. Approximately 8 of 10 people experiencing a major depressive disorder will have 1 or more episodes during their lifetime, i.e., a recurrent major depressive disorder [2]. In some patients, the episodes are separated by many symptom-free years of normal functioning. For others, the episodes become increasingly frequent [3]. This latter course appears to be the more prevalent, both in psychiatric and primary care settings [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].Partial remission between episodes, not full recovery, appears to be the rule and is associated with residual disability [7]. At least 1 patient out of 3 is likely to relapse within a year [4, 5, 6]. Two major risk factors associated with relapse appear to be persistence of subthreshold or subclinical symptoms and number of episodes of major depression [4, 5, 6, 7]. As a result, for most people, depression is a life-long episodic disorder with multiple recurrences (averaging 1 episode in every 5-year period) [8].The adverse economic, interpersonal and medical consequences (e.g. work impairment, and family dysfunction) of the course of unipolar depression are considerable [1]. The case vignette thus highlights a common clinical problem faced by clinicians, whether in primary care or specialty settings. As our patient meets the criteria for recurrent depression developed by Frank et al. [10](≥3 episodes of unipolar depression, with the immediately preceding episode being no more than 2.5 years before the onset of the present episode), there is an 80–90% chance of relapse within 2 years from remission of depression and discontinuation of antidepressant treatment [10, 11].Since the chances of relapse are so high, the primary care physician would think of referral to a psychiatric specialist as the next logical step, relying on his/her clinical judgment for further therapeutic strategies. There is very little empirical support, however, that this choice, per se, entails substantial benefits for the patient. An impressive series of studies point to this conclusion.Simon et al. [12]compared the 6-month outcome in depressed patients receiving antidepressant prescriptions either from psychiatrists or primary care physicians. The proportion receiving antidepressant medication at an adequate dose for 90 days or more was similar in both cases (about 50%). The two groups showed similar rates of improvement in all measures of symptom severity and functioning [12]. Even collaboration between primary care physicians and mental health consultants [13]or implementation of clinical-practice guidelines and practice-based education [14]did not yield any significant advantage over usual care in long-term outcome.Three hundred eighty-six patients with recurrent major depression or dysthymia who had recovered after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment by their primary care physicians were randomized to a relapse prevention program (involving a depression specialist) or usual primary care [15]. There were no significant differences in the relapse rate over a 12-month follow-up period.What emerges from these studies is the failure of the mental health specialist to improve the outcome of major depression in the primary care setting [16]. The introduction of more tolerable and easy-to-use antidepressant drugs, compared with the traditional tricyclics (which required dosages that nonpsychiatric physicians were reluctant to use), has blurred the difference among physicians in prescribing antidepressant drugs. At the same time, an impressive amount of pharmaceutical propaganda has clouded the evidence which underlies clinical decisions [17]. The main therapeutic strategies are now described, taking into consideration the most reliable findings available.Maintenance pharmacotherapy has been advocated as an effective tool for reducing relapses and recurrences in major depression [18, 19, 20]. A number of studies have demonstrated the superiority of antidepressant drugs (mostly tricyclics) against placebo in protecting the patient from relapsing [18, 19, 20]. Their average duration was 17 months [21]and only one small trial of imipramine reached 5 years [22]. Viguera et al. [23]analyzed 27 studies with variable length of antidepressant treatment which reported follow-up on drug discontinuation. Duration of drug treatment did not seem to affect long-term prognosis once the drug was discontinued. In clinical terms, this means that it does not matter whether you have treated a depressed patient for 3 months or 3 years, when you stop the drug. Indeed, there was a statistical trend which suggested that the longer the drug treatment, the higher was the likelihood of relapse [23]. An observational study on 236 unipolar patients, who had received antidepressants during recovery and were followed for an affective recurrence for up to 5 years, showed that the rate of recurrence for patients with fewer than 5 previous episodes was not affected by medication after the initial 8 months [24]. While benefits of long-term drug treatment have been clearly shown only in outpatients with major depression, we cannot assume that these can be achieved in the milder, heterogeneous forms of depression in primary care [19, 25].If we then consider the case vignette in light of the evidence we have summarized, we reach the following conclusions. One might judge the time of treatment with an antidepressant used by the primary care physician (6 months) in the previous 2 episodes as being too short and expect a more favorable outcome with a longer course of treatment (1 or 2 years). Certainly, during that time, the patient would be more protected from relapse than being drug free, but this would not affect the outcome after discontinuation of the antidepressant drug [23]. The problem would simply be postponed (table 1). One might expect this strategy to be valuable at a time when the patient is particularly exposed to stressful life circumstances. In a controlled study [26], however, maintenance pharmacotherapy was not found to be protective against life stress.Another option would be lifelong pharmacotherapy with antidepressant drugs. This, however, is not easy to communicate to the patient. Not infrequently, the physician starts with a gradual approach (telling the patient it will be for 1 or 2 years, while meaning indefinitely). Andrews [27]raised the issue of being more honest with people with recurrent depression and the need of long-term pharmacotherapy. However, if 'people have a right to the truth' [27], they are also entitled to the full story [28].Even though lifelong pharmacotherapy is chosen (table 2), there is the common and vexing problem of relapse during pharmacotherapy [29]. The return of depressive symptoms during long-term antidepressant treatment was found to occur in 9–57% of patients in published trials [30]. Possible explanations include pharmacological tolerance, loss of placebo effect, increase in disease severity, change in disease pathogenesis, accumulation of a detrimental metabolite, unrecognized rapid cycling, and prophylactic inefficacy [30]. A number of pharmacological strategies have been suggested in uncontrolled and often small trials for addressing this loss of efficacy (increase or decrease in dose, augmentation, change to a different drug), but specific guidelines do not exist [30]. In the first and only large-scale controlled trial [31], about 1 patient out of 3 relapsed during a 3.5-month maintenance treatment with fluoxetine. Two of the 3 patients relapsing while on fluoxetine responded to a blindly determined double dose of fluoxetine. However, part of these patients (11% of the initial ones) relapsed again while on doubled fluoxetine, despite the relatively short follow-up [31]. The patient should thus be warned that loss of clinical effects during long-term pharmacotherapy does occur, despite adequate compliance. Increasing the dose could be effective (at least temporarily), but depression can also become treatment resistant. Results from one study [32]suggest that full doses are superior to lower doses in the maintenance phase. Lower doses, however, are less likely to produce side effects [32]and more likely to allow a successful response by increasing the dosage when there is a loss of clinical effect [29]. The occurrence of side effects such as weight gain or sexual dysfunctions [21]may undermine compliance and quality of life.Lithium has been found to reduce relapses in unipolar depression [33]. However, also with lithium, progressive loss of clinical effect has been reported [34, 35]. Certainly reemergence of depressive symptoms in allegedly unipolar depressed patient treated with antidepressants calls for reconsideration of differential diagnosis, with particular reference to milder forms of bipolar disorder [29].Recurrence of depression in the case vignette can also be managed by treatment of the new episode with the same or other antidepressant and discontinuation when remission ensues [36]. The appearance of prodromal symptoms generally precedes the full syndrome by weeks or months [36]. An early intervention upon relapse was found to significantly shorten the length of the depressive episode [37]. As a result, relatively frequent follow-up visits and education of patients and their family members to recognize the patient's characteristic prodromal symptoms (which appear to be similar across episodes of the same patient) may potentially increase the efficacy of this approach [36]. This treatment, which is in line with approaches to recurrent disorders in clinical medicine, requires the establishment of a good patient-doctor relationship and a lower degree of compliance compared with the long-term pharmacotherapy. It should also be observed that a substantial proportion of patients discontinue antidepressant therapy after responding to the initial acute phase of treatment, regardless of the physician's advise [38, 39, 40, 41].Two main disadvantages may, however, be present (table 1). One is given by the phenomenon of resistance [29]: the likelihood that a drug treatment may be associated with a diminished chance of response in those patients who successfully responded to it but discontinued it. This phenomenon was considered to be relatively rare. In a naturalistic 6-year follow-up of depressed patients where the intermittent pharmacotherapy was used and patients were treated with the same antidepressant of the initial episode, it was found to take place only in 4% of instances [42]. However, the first study which assessed the efficacy prospectively of reinitiating exactly the same treatment (fluoxetine) in patients who had a depressive relapse upon drug discontinuation [43], provided a different picture. Thirty-eight percent of patients either did not respond or initially responded but again relapsed after reinitiation of fluoxetine. The second disadvantage has to do with discontinuation syndromes which may occur, particularly with SSRI, despite tapering [44, 45].The presence of residual symptoms, despite drug or psychotherapeutic treatment, has been strongly correlated with poor long-term outcome [7]. Further, some residual symptoms of major depression may progress to become prodromal symptoms of relapse [7]. This has led to the development of a sequential strategy based on the use of pharmacotherapy in the acute phase of depression and cognitive behavioral therapy in its residual phase [46]. In randomized controlled trials [11, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50], the various applications of this model have been found to yield a lower relapse rate in recurrent depression. Preliminary studies have suggested its usefulness also in atypical depression [51], bipolar disorder [52], and when loss of clinical effects occurs during long-term antidepressant treatment [53]. Its preventive effects appeared to be related to abatement of residual symptoms and/or increase in psychological well-being and coping skills. The practical steps for implementing this approach are described in table 2 and detailed elsewhere [46]. It may include discontinuation of antidepressant drug treatment, as outlined in table 2, or its maintenance. It may offer the advantage of yielding enduring effects while limiting the exposure to and costs of drug therapy. There are two main disadvantages (table 1). One is given by the fact that patients should be motivated to undergo a short-term (10–20 sessions) psychotherapeutic treatment while they are apparently well. The other is the fact that, while the other strategies may be pursued by a nonspecialist physician, implementation of the sequential approach requires referral to a specialized psychotherapist.Information is needed about several clinical issues surrounding recurrent depression.Attention has been called to the arbitrary nature of the distinction between treatment response associated with residual symptomatology and refractory depression [54]. At present, we do not know whether different antidepressant drugs may entail different rates of residual symptoms. What we know is that there may be differential remission rates, as was found to be the case for amitriptyline [55]and venlafaxine [56]. The question would be crucial in view of the role of residual symptoms in recurrent depression [54]. Similarly, we do not know whether combinations of antidepressant drugs, as they are used in treatment resistant depression [57], may yield a more pervasive recovery than a single antidepressant.Whether different antidepressant drugs or different dosages of the same antidepressant drug may engender different rates of loss of clinical effects is another crucial, unanswered clinical question [29]. At present, we have only one, large-scale, controlled study [31]on the effects of increasing the dosage of antidepressants. Other strategies, such as switching to a different type of antidepressant, have not been investigated in controlled studies [30]. We also need to know more about the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying tolerance to antidepressant drugs [58].Similarly, we do not know whether lack of response to an antidepressant which is reinstituted after a drug-free period in the same patient and which was found to be effective, may differ among drugs [54]. We also need to compare intermittent and continuation pharmacotherapy in controlled studies.Adding cognitive behavioral psychotherapy to the treatment package of recurrent depression was found to yield long-term benefits in terms of relapse rate [11, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50]. Both discontinuation and maintenance of pharmacotherapy have been used in the sequential approach, but have not been directly compared in controlled studies. Is there an advantage in keeping drug treatment after psychotherapy?Guidelines for the treatment of depression are available to clinicians. Both those developed by the American Psychiatric Association [59]and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Practice Guidelines [60], while providing evidence-based data on the management of the acute phase of depression, do not provide adequate discussion of the different strategies that recurrent depression entails. Evidence indicates that both antidepressant pharmacotherapy and time-limited depression-targeted psychotherapies are efficacious in primary care settings [59]. The Primary Care Guideline Panel recommended maintenance pharmacotherapy for patients with histories of 3 or more depressive episodes and vulnerability to future recurrences because of associated risk factors [60]. Guidelines for treating depression in primary care were developed also in Australia and New Zealand [61]. They suggested at least 2 years of continuation of pharmacotherapy for repeated episodes or where there were other risk factors for relapse [61].Hollon and Shelton [62]show how treatment guidelines for major depressive disorders understate the case for the empirically supported psychosocial interventions. Another important aspect in the development of guidelines is the issue of conflict of interest of those involved in them [63, 64, 65], which disclosure fails to correct [66].The World Health Organization ranked major depression as the fourth most disabling medical disorder by disability-adjusted life years, a measure of burden [67]. By 2010, World Health Organization projected, major depression will be ranked second unless meaningful improvements occur in prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The case illustrated in the vignette outlines the difficulties that prevention of depressive recurrences entails. On the basis of evidence available, the following approach is outlined.First, the patient should be offered adequate information about the prognosis of her depressive illness. It is unlikely that a new course of treatment with the same or similar antidepressant will favorably affect her condition. Andrews [27]remarks that many doctors are concerned that telling people the true prognosis will cause their depression to worsen. However, this very much depends on the content and modalities of the communication. In our Affective Disorders Program, we share with our patients that depression is likely to recur [28]. In the case vignette, we would tell her that depression is very likely to ensue again once antidepressant drugs are stopped. So, one option would be to continue with an antidepressant drug indefinitely. We would tell her, however, that also this option is not completely risk free, since loss of clinical effect may occur. The other option would be to start working on prevention of the next episode. For doing this, we would need to view depression not as something coming 'out of a clear sky', but as a result of a maladaptive lifestyle. Depressed patients are often unaware of the consequences of long-term minor life stresses, interpersonal friction, prolonged anxiety, excessive work, and inadequate rest [11]. It is ironic that, while psychiatrists tend to view prevention of relapse of depression purely in pharmacological terms, as if it were a disease such as diabetes [27], diabetologists, as other medical specialists, emphasize the importance of nonpharmacological strategies [68]. This second option is more difficult to pursue, but is likely to yield enduring effects. We would also explain to the patient that a longer course of treatment with an antidepressant drug this time would be unlikely to yield a better prognosis once the drug is discontinued [23]. In our clinical experience, patients generally look favorably to pursuing a treatment strategy that may provide long-term effects.If the patient described in the vignette accepted to try to pursue a sequential approach, we would treat her with the same drug that was used in the previous 2 episodes. If resistance occurs, we would switch her to a different type of antidepressant (a drug affecting both serotonin and noradrenaline, such as a tricyclic). After 3 months of treatment, we would reassess the patient carefully (table 2). Is she well or simply better? What is the level of residual symptomatology? Such an assessment may require both structured interviews and self-observation (diary). A helpful example which we make is the following. 'When we first saw you, you were very depressed. Driving the way you did, you went off the road. With antidepressant drugs, we did put you back on the road. Things are much better now. However, if you keep on driving the way you used to, you may end up off the road again, sooner or later' [46]. The example outlines the need for lifestyle modification and introduces a sense of control in the patient as to his or her depressive illness. This psychological preparation paves the way for subsequent psychotherapeutic approaches.The clinician could then refer the patient for a short-term (10–20 sessions) course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. This would be the psychotherapeutic approach of choice, since it has been specifically studied for its preventive effects [46]. We would be inclined to taper antidepressant drugs during the course of psychotherapeutic treatment (table 2). Tapering should be performed at the slowest possible pace, to minimize the risk of antidepressant medication discontinuation syndromes [21, 59]. There are no significant differences in relapse rates off medication between studies involving rapid discontinuation and those in which tapering was more gradual [23]. Slow tapering, however, may allow the detection of emerging symptoms in their prodromal phases, which may become the target of psychotherapeutic strategy [54]. Interventions that bring the person out of a negative functioning are one form of success, but facilitating progression toward psychological well-being is quite another [69]. This is an emerging area for psychotherapeutic research and practice [46, 69]. The advantages of maintaining the patient on antidepressant drugs are not clear, unless one aims to keep pharmacotherapy indefinitely and to use the addition of a psychotherapy only as a boosting strategy.A final aspect of the sequential approach lies in a careful assessment of the patient once both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy have been terminated. If improvement appears to have occurred, the patient can be seen at regular follow-up visits, geared not only to verify the presence of depressive relapses, but also to assess the subclinical symptomatology [7]. If substantial residual symptomatology persists despite clinical response or minimal or no benefits have been achieved by psychotherapeutic approach, then indefinite drug treatment can be discussed with the patient. In our clinical experience, however, the patient has gained a better psychological acceptance of a pharmacological approach. Whether this should be indefinite or intermittent (table 1), very much depends on the patient's preferences and the patient-doctor relationship (with ensuing opportunities for monitoring the patient). Clinical indicators for indefinite, instead of intermittent, drug therapy could be rapid onset of depression with suicidal ideations and the likelihood of severe discontinuation syndromes in a specific patient.Prevention of recurrence in major depression cannot simply be based on prolongation of ongoing pharmacological treatment. The evidence available suggests that the active collaboration of the patient (in choosing a treatment option, in lifestyle modification, in seeking treatment again when needed) is a crucial, and yet neglected variable. This can lead to a more rational use of antidepressant drugs and to therapeutic efforts of more enduring quality than those prevailing today [70].This paper was supported in part by grants from the Ministero dell' Università e della Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica (MURST, Roma, Italy) to G.A.F. and N.S. and by a grant from the 'Mental Health Evaluation Project' (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Roma, Italy) to G.A.F.

The psychiatric syndrome may appear without physical symptoms, or may accompany severe systemic involvement. In either case psychiatric diagnosis is quite difficult and consequently treatment is often controversial. We review current knowledge and present the case of an 18-year-old male which illustrates the complexity of both diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

We will describe four cases of catatonia that occurred over one year in a single medicine department. All four patients were over 60 years old. The causes of catatonia were diverse: hemorrhagic shock occurring in the context of mixed dementia, schizoaffective disorder, a severe major depressive episode, and a depressive syndrome associated with Lewy body disease. Three out of four patients were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and all evolved towards remission. The diagnoses were consistently established by a liaison psychiatrist. Before the recruitment of liaison psychiatrists in the institution, this diagnosis had not been considered in the department. The cause of catatonia can be psychiatric (75 to 80% of cases) and/or non-psychiatric (20 to 25% of cases). In two thirds of organic cases, it is a condition of the central nervous system. Symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepine allows for remission of symptoms in more than two thirds of cases. In the absence of response to benzodiazepines, treatment with electroconvulsive therapy is indicated. Catatonia can progress to death, following possible complications or in cases of severe dysautonomia (malignant catatonia). Catatonia is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Despite a relatively high prevalence, well-defined diagnostic criteria, and a symptomatic treatment that is often very effective, the prognosis of catatonia can be poor in the absence of treatment. Psychiatrists should be consulted whenever there is doubt regarding a clinical presentation.",

      "abstract": "Il est classique de dire que le deuil va entraîner des conséquences biopsychosociales. Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

      "title": "BIOCHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHONEUROSES— A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant medication varies considerably between studies, making it difficult to estimate the exact incidence or prevalence. The sexual problems reported range from decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, to erection or delayed ejaculation problems. There are a number of case reports of sexual side effects, such as priapism, painful ejaculation, penile anesthesia, loss of sensation in the vagina and nipples, persistent genital arousal and nonpuerperal lactation in women. The focus of this article is to explore the incidence, pathophysiology, and treatment of antidepressant iatrogenic sexual dysfunction.

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

Information that stroke affects young, sexually active persons is becoming more and more common, however this aspect of patients' functionality falls into the background, both for patients and specialists, as it seems to be less important than other disorders. These patients report the decrease of all sexual functions such as libido, erectile function, orgasm, vaginal lubrication and sexual satisfaction; the frequency of intercourse decreases significantly. The sexual dysfunction in these patients depends on many factors. Among them, we can distinguish between the extent of the focus of the stroke, the method of treatment and the level of general post-stroke disability. Some of the sexual disfunctions are temporary in the initial period they result mainly neurological deficit (aphasia, movement disorders, paresis, limbs paralysis) later on, psychological factors may start playing a significant role. These disturbances also show some dynamics over time. The etiology of sexual disorders after stroke is multi-functional. There are organic factors and also psychosocial and psychological. Among psychological factors, depression, anxiety and fear that the stroke can come back can lead to the decrease of one's sexual drive. Sexual dysfunction in patients after a stroke may be associated with a malfunction of the genitourinary system, including urinary incontinence.

Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders. There is also emerging evidence that insomnia increases the risk for incident hypertension and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "El delirio de relacion sensitivo representa un tipo determinado de enferme­ dad o un tipo reactivo paranoico bien caracterizado por su etiologia, sus sintomas y la forma de su evolucion. Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad. Los representantes mas perfilados de este grupo caracterial son individuos complicados, de elevada inteligencia y de gran valor; poseen una sen­ sibilidad fina y profunda, y poseen una etica escrupulosa. Su vida psiquica inte­ riorizada e hipersensible hace que sean presa facil para las pruebas banales de la vida. Ocultan profundamente sus afectos, y los ocultan durante mucho tiempo. Se analizan y se critican con refinamiento. Son muy susceptibles y tenaces, pero",

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

ED may induce depression, loss of self-esteem, poor self-image, anxiety, and tension in the relationship with the partner. These emotional disturbances can create physical conditions that lead to increased difficulty in achieving an erection. Depression can deprive a person of the ability to experience many of life's pleasures. It not only affects the mind but also the body--often in unexpected ways. As a result, many men who have been diagnosed with depression find themselves suffering from another condition: ED. Sexual dysfunction is a big problem also in patients with chronic renal failure and seriously affects their quality of life. About 40% of men on dialysis suffer from ED. Many uremic patients have additional symptoms including reduction of libido and a decreased frequency of sexual intercourse. With the start of dialysis some of these symptoms may improve, without, however, returning to normal.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

One of the first diagnostic considerations must be the establishment of primary or secondary libidinal dificit, or indeed, whether there is no libido at all. In cases of libido disorders with primary libido dificit, depression, organic disease, or side effects of pharmaca may be the cause. Libido disorders in the presence of functional libido, however, must be regarded as primarily psychologically caused. An exception are libido problems in the presence of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vasculatory defeciencies. In these cases libido is either totally absent or appears only secondarily. The symptomatology of libido disorders in the presence of depression, diabetes melitus, and peripheral vasculatory disturbancies, as well as psychologically caused erectile and ejaculatory difficulties are discussed in detail. These groups are compared with respect to libido and behavior involving erection, ejaculation, anxiety and avoidance.",

Overview of Sexual Dysfunction in WomenSexual dysfunction can refer to difficulties in libido (sex drive), arousal, or orgasm.There are many causes of sexual dysfunction.Psychiatric conditions such as depression or anxiety or emotional distress from work or relationship stressors are common causes.Some medical conditions can also affect sexual function, such as heart disease, certain neurological conditions, arthritis, or hormone changes during menopause.Medications, especially antidepressants, can also cause sexual dysfunction.Addressing the underlying medical or psychological issues improves sexual function in most women.However, some women who have no other medical or psychological concerns still have low sexual desire that affects both their personal and relationship well-being.This condition is referred to as female sexual interest/arousal disorder.This is a new diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition), which combined the previously separate disorders of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and female sexual arousal disorder.The prevalence of these disorders varies widely depending on the population surveyed, but studies have suggested it can range anywhere from 5% to 15% of women.Treatment of HSDD and female sexual arousal disorder can be challenging.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

We obtained a retrospective history from 24 subjects who were long term (more than 1 year) recovered from anorexia nervosa. We found that 58% reported that they had the onset of one or more childhood anxiety disorder diagnoses at the age of 10 +/- 5 years old. This was 5 years before the mean age of onset of anorexia nervosa. The onset of depression was about 1 year before the onset of anorexia nervosa in about one half the subjects. Alcohol and substance abuse/dependency tended to occur after the onset of anorexia nervosa and only occurred in anorexic subjects who binged and/or purged. The early and common onset of childhood anxiety disorders in a substantial percentage of anorexics raises the possibility that childhood anxiety disorders herald the first behavioral expression of a biologic vulnerability in some subjects who develop anorexia nervosa.",

      "abstract": "Many people suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, statistics showing that 1 in 3 people have their lives affected because of these worrying and annoying symptoms. One of the most common anxiety disorders observed in general medical practice and in the general population is the generalized anxiety disorder. In about 85% of cases, generalized anxiety does not appear alone, but is accompanied by other psychological problems, of which the most common are: depression, other anxiety disorders, substance abuse, digestive problems, etc. The patient diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) usually has suffered from severe anxiety and worries about several different areas of their life for at least six months. It occurs in 5-9% of the population, and the incidence is twice as high in women as in men. Generalized anxiety usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood. GAG is caused by several factors: 30%-50% of it can be genetic in nature, but it also can be caused by experiences during childhood, recent stressful life events, unrealistic expectations about others and oneself, conflicts in relationships, alcohol consumption, coping skills and other factors (Ciubara et al., 2018). Studies show that the anxiety levels in the general population have risen over the past 50 years - probably due to declining social cohesion affecting communities, unrealistic expectations for quality of life, excessive focus on negative news, and other factors, social and cultural aspects.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

Low sexual desire in men includes a lack of interest in thinking about sex or in being sexual, alone or with a partner. Sexual health counseling often is helpful. Physicians should prescribe supplemental testosterone only if it is clearly indicated. (Sexual dysfunction is an off-label use of testosterone.) Supplementation is not beneficial for men with a normal total testosterone level. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the consistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain a penile erection sufficient for sexual satisfaction. The cause typically is multifactorial. The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are the first-line pharmacotherapies for most patients with ED. Their use is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates. Peyronie disease is an acquired penile abnormality that causes curvature or other deformities of the erect penis. Premature ejaculation is defined as a lack of ejaculatory control that is associated with distress. All pharmacotherapies for premature ejaculation are used off label. First-line treatment options include daily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, paroxetine), on-demand clomipramine, and topical penile anesthetics. Psychotherapeutic and physical therapies also have been shown to be effective.",

      "abstract": "Of 842 consecutive patients with movement disorders seen over a 71 month period, 28 (3.3%) were diagnosed as having a documented or clinically established psychogenic movement disorder. Tremor was most common (50%) followed by dystonia, myoclonus, and parkinsonism. Clinical descriptions of various types are reviewed. Clinical characteristics common in these patients included distractability (86%), abrupt onset (54%), and selective disabilities (39%). Distractability seems to be most important in tremor and least important in dystonia. Other diagnostic clues included entrainment of tremor to the frequency of repetitive movements of another limb, fatigue of tremor, stimulus sensitivity, and previous history of psychogenic illness. On examination, 71% had other psychogenic features. Over 60% had a clear history of a precipitating event and secondary gain and 50% had a psychiatric diagnosis (usually depression). Twenty five per cent of patients presented with combined psychogenic movement disorder and organic movement disorder; 35% resolved and this subgroup had a shorter duration of disease than those who are unresolved. Psychogenic movement disorder represents an uncommon diagnosis among patients with movement disorders. The ability to make a diagnosis rests on the presence of a multitude of clinical clues and therapeutic action should be taken as early as possible.",

      "abstract": "Masturbation, or self-stimulation of the genitalia is a common human behavior, said to occur in 90–94% of males and 50–60% of females at some time in their lives [1]. Infantile masturbation is highlighted because masturbatory behavior has been often mistaken for epilepsy due to usual presentation with paroxysmal movements of recurrent character [2]. Infantile masturbation can also mimic other conditions such as abdominal pain, paroxysmal dystonia and dyskinesia [3, 4]. Masturbatory activity in infant and young children is difficult to recognize because it has a spectrum of different behavior patterns, which often do not involve manual stimulation of the genitalia. Misdiagnosis consequently may lead to unnecessary investigations and treatment [2,3]. The condition is more often seen in girls than in boys (65% among 31 patients in Nechay at al. [5], all 12 patients were girls in Yang et al. [4]). It often starts at age under 1 year of life. Episodes are usually observed when the child is sitting in a car seat, when he/she is bored or tired and in relation to the transition between waking and sleeping [5]. During the events of masturbation children exhibit different types of behavior: dystonia-like posturing of different parts of the body has been most often seen, grunting, flushing and sweating are also very typical; rocking and assumed eidetic imagery (seeing ‘telly in the sky’) can also be observed",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

We report a series of patients in whom recurrent, unprovoked, typical AS was the main clinical feature. Method : We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients referred to our epileptic centers, on the following criteria: (1) recurrent, unprovoked episodes of typical AS representing the unique or the predominant seizure type, (2) at least one episode of AS recorded by video‐EEG or by EEG only, and (3) clinical and EEG features fulfilling the criteria of idiopathic epilepsy. We excluded patients with situation‐related AS. Results : We found 11 such cases (5F, 6M). The onset of AS was after puberty or in early adulthood in most; no clear triggering factor could account for the recurrence of AS episodes; infrequent generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and, rarely, absences, could also occur. These patients had no family history of epilepsy, normal neurological evaluation, normal neuroimaging, interictal EEG showing generalized spike‐ and polyspike‐wave discharges on a normal background, no photoparoxysmal response, variable response of AS to intravenous benzodiazepines, and usually good seizure control with valproate. This peculiar condition was misdiagnosed in most because of the unusual clinical presentation and of some atypical interictal EEG findings, often leading to the use of inappropriate drugs. Conclusion : Although there is some overlap with previously described epilepsy syndromes, specific and shared features point to the existence of a distinct epilepsy entity that we propose to name “absence status epilepsy.” This syndrome expands the spectrum of idiopathic generalized epilepsies.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "The restrictions imposed upon sexual activity by neck, back and radicular pain syndromes are of serious concern to the patient. In recent years the subject of When, and even How is raised with increasing frequency, and the patient expects the physician to reply with appropriate answers. The reply must be tempered by the level of the patient's recovery, the evaluation of what other activities the patient can perform without pain or with minimal pain and the method to be used. Sexual activity may precipitate recurrent pain or aggravate existing pain in the same manner as lifting, pushing, pulling or any other physical activity, if performed too early or too vigorously in the course of recovery from neck, back or radicular pain syndromes. In dealing with the problem of recovery from painful musculoskeletal or neuromuscular states, timing is of the utmost importance. Unless a timetable is specifically outlined, recurrences are common, and the condition may become chronic. The inability of the patient to deal satisfactorily with the sexual aspect of his daily living may, in itself, lead to emotional tensions and guilt feelings which may delay or prevent recovery. There is need to handle this problem at every level of the involvement in order to achieve a desirable end result-namely, the absence of pain and its replacement with pleasure.",

Las soluciones ni son simples ni uniformes en los diferentes sindromes, que algunas veces se asocian con patologias conocidas como el sindrome de Down, rubeola congenita, sindromes de Rett o de la X fragil, embriopatia por valproato, etc. Para hacer un diagnostico de autismo, el DSM-IV –de la Asociacion Americana de Psiquiatria- indica que es necesario encontrar las siguientes caracteristicas: A. Un total de seis o mas manifestaciones de (1), (2) y (3), con l menos dos de (1), al menos una de (2), y al menos una de (3). 1. Trastorno cualitativo de la relacion, expresado como minimo en dos de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Trastorno importante en muchas conductas de relacion no verbal, como la mirada a los ojos, la expresion facial, las posturas corporales y los gestos para regular la interaccion social. b. Incapacidad para desarrollar relaciones con iguales adecuadas al nivel de desarrollo. c. Ausencia de conductas espontaneas encaminadas a compartir placeres, intereses o logros con otras personas (por ejemplo, de conductas de senalar o mostrar objetos de interes). d. Falta de reciprocidad social o emocional.  2. Trastornos cualitativos de la comunicacion, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Retraso o ausencia completa de desarrollo del lenguaje oral (que no se intenta compensar con medios alternativos de comunicacion, como los gestos o mimica). b. En personas con habla adecuada, trastorno importante en la capacidad de iniciar o mantener conversaciones. c. Empleo estereotipado o repetitivo del lenguaje, o uso de un lenguaje idiosincrasico. d. Falta de juego de ficcion espontaneo y variado, o de juego de imitacion social adecuado al nivel de desarrollo. 3. Patrones de conducta, interes o actividad restrictivos, repetitivos y estereotipados, expresados como minimo en una de las siguientes manifestaciones: a. Preocupacion excesiva por un foco de interes (o varios) restringido y estereotipado, anormal por  su intensidad o contenido. b. Adhesion aparentemente inflexible a rutinas o rituales especificos y no funcionales. c. Estereotipias motoras repetitivas (por ejemplo, sacudidas de manos, retorcer los dedos, movimientos complejos de todo el cuerpo, etc.). d. Preocupacion persistente por partes de objetos. B. Antes de los tres anos, deben producirse retrasos o alteraciones en una de estas tres areas: (1) Interaccion social, (2) Empleo comunicativo del lenguaje o (3) Juego simbolico.  C.

Comprehensive assessment of sex offenders includes a full history and mental state evaluation, obtaining a collateral history from other sources, observation, psychometric testing, and psychophysiological methods of assessment, including penile plethysmography. Trials of the use of the polygraph are also under way. The treatment of sex offenders, especially those with paraphilias, may include medication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or anti-libidinal agents.

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

No major changes in the neurological status of these children were observed. However, the three children with ADHD showed an exacerbation of symptoms on fluoxetine.

      "title": "Functional limitations associated with mental disorders : inescapable fact or avoidable reality?",
      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "title": "Adjustment Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals, regardless of their age, are subjected to a significant psychosocial stressor, two possible outcomes are likely—in one instance the person is not significantly affected by the stressor and proceeds on with their life without indication of perceptible problem. In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL) is characterized by fractures (resulting from radiologically demonstrable polycystic osseous lesions), frontal lobe syndrome, and progressive presenile dementia beginning in the fourth decade. The clinical course of PLOSL can be divided into four stages: 1 The latent stage is characterized by normal early development. 2 The osseous stage (3rd decade of life) is characterized by pain and tenderness, mostly in ankles and feet, usually following strain or injury. Fractures are typically diagnosed several years later, most commonly in the bones of the extremities. 3 In the early neurologic stage (4th decade of life), a change of personality begins to develop insidiously. Affected individuals show a frontal lobe syndrome (loss of judgment, euphoria, loss of social inhibitions, disturbance of concentration, and lack of insight, libido, and motor persistence) leading to serious social problems. 4 The late neurologic stage is characterized by progressive dementia and loss of mobility. Death usually occurs before age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PLOSL can be established in a proband with radiologically demonstrable polycystic osseous lesions, frontal lobe syndrome, and progressive presenile dementia beginning in the fourth decade. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TYROBP or TREM2 can confirm the diagnosis if radiographic and clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Orthopedic surgery and/or devices may be of value in individual cases. Antiepileptic drugs can be used to prevent epileptic seizures and secondary worsening of the condition. Prevention of secondary complications: Some of the social consequences of PLOSL may be avoided if family members are informed early about the nature of the disorder. Surveillance: Intervals for follow up of bone lesions and neurologic and psychiatric manifestations must be determined on an individual basis. Genetic counseling PLOSL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a TREM2 or TYROBP pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.",

Screening for MDD is recommended in the general adult population when resources are available for diagnosis, management, and follow-up. Several screening tools are available, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC). Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence. Referral to a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician should be considered when the diagnosis is in question or when symptoms do not improve with standard treatment.",

      "title": "Psychological Inflexibility in Depression with Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that can last for weeks or even months, in which there is a depressed mood accompanied by anxiety, in addition to negative changes in cognitive functions, psychomotor movement and vegetative functions. Depression with psychotic features is a psychiatric syndrome that progresses with delusions as well as severe symptoms such as psychomotor retardation or agitation, depressive ruminations, deterioration in cognitive functions, and confusion. Compared to the subtypes without psychotic features, the symptoms are more severe, the age of onset is earlier, and the duration of the disease is longer. Feelings of guilt, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide are more common. The risk of exacerbation is greater. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is more common in first-degree relatives of these patients. Objectives An 18-year-old female patient with somatic delusions and psychotic persistence that started after a sexual trauma and persisted for 1 month was consulted after organic exclusions were made. It is understood from the anamnesis that the patient had a manic episode about 6 months ago and that his mother was followed up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The patient’s current clinical picture was evaluated as depression with psychotic features, and after hospitalization, the treatment was adjusted as fluoxetine 20 mg/g, olanzapine 5 mg/g, and lithium 900 mg/g. Self as context, cognitive defusion and acceptance interventions were applied to the patient. Methods When the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire(CFQ), Self-as-Context Scale(SACS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire(AAQ-II) completed by the patient during hospitalization and in remission periods were compared, it was observed that there was a significant regression in the patient’s psychological inflexibility during the period of remission. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient whose clinical picture was presented in order to contribute to the scientific literature. Results Depression with psychotic features is another clinical picture in which psychological inflexibility increases, and it has been observed that interviews to increase psychological flexibility during the treatment process contribute positively to the treatment process. For this reason, the contribution to the healing process can be better clarified in further studies on interventions to increase psychological flexibility applied in addition to pharmacological treatments. Image: Conclusions Psychological inflexibility is an effort to control a person’s emotion, thought, behavior or experience in a dysfunctional way in the face of an undesired experience. It has been seen in studies conducted in recent years that; There is a significant positive correlation between high psychological inflexibility and somatization, depression, anxiety and other psychological disorders.

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization reported a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% for BD-I, BD-II and sub-threshold types of bipolar disorder (BD). Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

Esta cifra es mucho más elevada que la que se encuentra en enfermos depresivos más jóvenes y puede atribuirse al efecto patoplástico de la edad. El sexo del enfermo no guarda ninguna relación estadística con la frecuencia con que aparecen estos síntomas. &#x0D; &#x0D; Los síntomas hipocondríacos se manifestaron, solos, o acompañados de otros síntomas depresivos, desde el comienzo de la enfermedad en 72-casos (47,3%).

En ninguno de estos 28 casos se hizo en estos hospitales una exploración psiquiátrica sencilla enfocada a descubrir una posible depresión, y únicamente se llegó al diagnóstico correcto después de que el enfermo se intentó suicidar o tuvo una crisis de agitación. &#x0D; &#x0D; Aproximadamente el 25% de los enfermos que presentaban síntomas hipocondríacos intentó suicidarse, mientras que entre los que no presentaban estos síntomas; únicamente el 3,28%.&#x0D; &#x0D; Se detallan las diversas localizaciones y características de estos síntomas.

Se detallan las razones por las cuales es importante llegar a este diagnóstico precoz y se sugiere un esquema sencillo de exploración psiquiátrica que quizá pueda ayudar al médico general a excluir la posibilidad de una depresión.",

Multiple psychosocial and health-related factors and prior exposures are associated with risk for clinical depression, anxiety, and negative mood symptoms and syndromes in women of all ages. These include low socioeconomic status, life stressors, inadequate social support, vulnerable personality traits, medical conditions, vasomotor symptoms, psychiatric history, health history, reproductive-related factors, childhood abuse and family history and genetics. Few are specific or unique to psychiatric morbidity during the menopausal transition. Those that may be more prevalent or limiting during this period of life than prior to it include vasomo-tor symptoms, life stressors, and increased physical problems. The extent to which the physical and biological changes during the transition make women more vulnerable to the effects of factors such as low social support, a tendency to ruminate, or a history of childhood abuse are not known.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "title": "Alcohol Abuse",
      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS in which psychoneurological symptoms prevail. For the diagnosis of PMDD, the specific DSM-5 criteria were developed by the American Psychiatric Association according to which the the diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of five or more symptoms in women during the week prior to menstruation and their disappearance a few days after the onset of menstruation. These symptoms are observed for at least two cycles. Treatment of women with PMS/PMDD, first of all, should start with the lifestyle adjustment, inclusion of regular mode rate physical activity into daily activities. The effectiveness of vitamins B6, E and calcium has not been confirmed in studies. First-line drug therapy includes SSRIs or combined oral contraceptives containing drospirenone are prescribed first, then agonists of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.",

In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959).

The symptoms were most marked in infancy, but ameliorated with time, becoming milder than in the average acquired case.

      "title": "Resolution of stuttering during ketamine treatment: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stuttering may include repetition of words in whole or part, difficulty saying words, and elongated pauses in speech. Approximately 5% of children stutter for a period lasting 6 months or more. Most of those children stop stuttering as they approach adulthood, but the condition persists in approximately 1% of adults. The cause of stuttering is unknown. Adults who stutter face substantial burdens in many aspects of their lives. Stutterers may choose not to pursue meaningful employment opportunities, may not be hired for positions they seek, or may be denied promotions or positive performance evaluations. Stuttering can cause physical tension from fear of speaking. Social challenges arise when a person who stutters is seen as less capable or of lower intelligence than fluent speakers. Stuttering causes emotional difficulties through the frustration and embarrassment that disfluent speakers feel. Stutterers may experience a general loss of self-esteem and personal satisfaction in life. Speech therapy is the primary intervention for stuttering. Medications have been investigated as treatments for stuttering, but no medication has been identified that has widespread effectiveness. Case presentation A 60-year-old white non-Hispanic woman who had been a near lifelong stutterer was prescribed ketamine for an unrelated condition and experienced an almost immediate resolution of her stuttering. Conclusions Many possible pharmacological treatments for stuttering have been studied. Some medications appear to be effective in some patients; some appear to be more generally effective but have negative side effects. No reporting in relevant literature has addressed a possible role for ketamine in stuttering treatment. On the basis of this case report, research on the effect of ketamine on stuttering would be useful. Any effective treatment for stuttering would have a significant positive effect on quality of life for persons who stutter.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a disorder with a high prevalence that increases with age. It is estimated that 18.9% of men’s between 25 and 70 years suffer it in Spain. Most cases have a multifactorial origin and it is admitted the influence on its pathogenesis of systemic diseases, different kind of drugs, psychogenic factors, cardiovascular, endocrinological and neurological diseases. Neurologic cause erectile dysfunction may have its origin in the central or peripheral nervous system. Among possible process of neurogenic erectile dysfunction of central origin would be tumors, cerebral vascular accidents, encephalitis, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis and other demyelinization diseases, dementias, olivopontocerebellar degeneration and epilepsy. Myelopathies of any etiology may be, depending on their localization and extension, cause of erectile dysfunction. At the peripheral level, disorders of the sensitive tracts constituting the afferent limb of the erection spinal reflex, and the efferent vegetative or somatic tracts mediating arterial vasodilatation, cavernous smooth muscle relaxation or pelvic floor striated muscle contraction. The aim of this work is to review in detail the most relevant causes of neurogenic erectile dysfunction, their etiopathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic approaches currently considered more adequate for each particular case.CONCLUSIONS: The correct diagnostic approach to patients with erectile dysfunction passes through identification, if possible, of the etiopathogenic factors implied. Regarding this, detection and identification of a possible neurogenic risk factor will contribute to a better understanding of the physiopathologic mechanisms, and more adequate diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches, mainly in those patients refractory to first line therapy.",

      "abstract": "Urodynamic analysis has revealed a high proportion of uninhibited bladder activity in adult enuresis. There was no associated neurological deficit to explain this abnormality. There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "title": "Aging, Disability and Frailty",
      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioural symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in a close reciprocal relation with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other non-antidepressant treatments, or the more extreme intervneitons that eliminate ovulation altogether, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that SSRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SSRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms.

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

However, some children fail to inhibit this normal aggression and by the time they are three or four are showing signs of oppositional defiant disorder. In older children persistent antisocial behaviour is classified as conduct disorder. At any age, antisocial behaviour is on a continuum, and while the most severe 5% or so will meet diagnostic criteria, those falling short are often described as having conduct problems. Epidemiological follow-up surveys show that the risk of poor outcomes in antisocial children is very high. The causes are multiple but two sets of factors stand out. First, genetic predisposition. Even children adopted away from violent or criminal parents have three or four times the rate of antisocial behaviour and second, poor parenting. Watching and waiting is a reasonable strategy if the antisocial behaviour is not very severe. It is important to be vigilant for severe tantrums or aggression occurring almost every day, harsh, rough, or inconsistent parenting and coexistent ADHD. If severity is moderate, referral to an evidence-based parenting group would be a good first move. If this fails to make things better, or if the child or parent has a comorbid condition, referral to CAMHS is indicated. For older children, aged 10 to 17, there are effective interventions such as anger management CBT and parenting groups for adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Psychotropic-related sexual dysfunction is a quite frequent issue in clinical practice, mainly in chronic treatments affecting both quality of life and compliance. Recent findings In the last decade fortunately antidepressants and antipsychotic compounds have been deeply screened in order to identify sexual adverse events that were commonly underdiagnosed and previously underestimated by clinicians and perhaps by pharmaceutical companies as well. Some differences in the mechanism of action are the nucleus of this poorly tolerated adverse event. All antidepressants with serotonergic activity can cause mild to severe sexual dysfunction such as decreased libido and delayed orgasm frequently (>60%) or anorgasmia and arousal difficulties sometimes (30%). In contrast, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, or melatonergic antidepressants do not cause sexual dysfunction but perhaps the clinical profile of patients receiving these compounds could be different. Antipsychotics that highly increase prolactin levels and strongly block dopamine receptors could be related to sexual dysfunction as well. Unfortunately, these dysfunctions are present during the long term after the antipsychotic onset to provide continued symptom control and enable recovery. Young patients suffering psychosis and concomitant sexual dysfunction (erectile and/or orgasmic difficulties) tend to show poor compliance in chronic treatments affecting the outcomes. Summary The implications of psychotropic-related sexual dysfunction in clinical practice are relevant mainly in patients under long-term treatment with previous satisfactory sexual life. Implications for future research about sexual dysfunction in all new treatments should be strongly taken into account.",

Post-traumatic stress may emerge in children and teens who are exposed to overwhelming experiences: accidental trauma; physical or sexual abuse; repeated or prolonged medical or surgical hospitalizations with difficult procedures to endure. Some ethnic and racial minority patients are at increased risk for traumatic experiences, including child abuse.",

We report on an 84-year-old woman with WD. Despite the absence of treatment, the only symptom she presented with, until the age of 74 years, was Kayser-Fleisher rings. At the age of 74, she developed slightly abnormal liver function. This case raises the following issues: (a) Should WD be considered in all patients of all ages who manifest signs related to the disease? (b) Are ATP7B mutations fully penetrant? (c) Should all patients diagnosed presymptomatically receive anticopper therapy?",

      "title": "Antidepressant maintenance medications: when to discontinue and how to stop.",
      "abstract": "Most depressive disorders, once developed, have a lifetime course. For the majority of patients, the risk for future episodes increases as the number of past episodes increases. The length of the well interval between episodes becomes progressively shorter with each new episode. Those who are older at onset often have higher probabilities of relapse during future years if not maintained on treatment. As the number of episodes grows larger and the patient becomes older, severity often intensifies, treatment responsivity to conventional antidepressants may diminish or even disappear, and the destructive consequences of the disorder progressively worsen. This destructive lifetime pattern can be prevented in many if not most patients since antidepressant and other maintenance medications are being shown to be efficacious in preventing most future episodes of depression, maintaining euthymia, and preserving quality of life. On the basis of these and other still-developing findings (and with the recognition that maintenance strategies have been inadequately tested in depressed children and adolescents), reasonable clinical wisdom might suggest that lifetime pharmacologic maintenance may be indicated for patients 50 years or older at first episode, 40 years or older with two or more prior episodes, or for those with three or more prior episodes. \"Maintenance\" dosages need to be comparable to established \"treatment\" dosages until it is proven that lower doses are efficacious; such data now are lacking. When medication is selected for long-term treatment, strong considerations should be given to the agent's side effect profile, since compliance is essential for success.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "Recovery Versus Remission in Schizophrenia and Related Persistent Psychotic Disorders: no Contrasting but Complementary Models",
      "abstract": "At present there is no consensus on defining “Recovery” in schizophrenia,while there is an accepted definition of “Remission”. Remission model considers “stability” the treatment primary goal and, once achieved, focus is on mainteining stability and preventing relapse. This model reflects a condition where are absent prominent symptoms but may be present some mild symptoms of schizophrenia, retaining not realistic absence of any symptoms. It would require treating an acute psychotic episode,then there still may be a range of no detectable or persistent and disabling symptoms:remission and level of functioning are related but not the same. Some patients could have good level of functioning despite persistent symptoms and others could meet remission criteria despite considerable impairments. Remission is an obteinable outcome for many psychotic outpatients:the point of departure between manteinance and recovery-oriented model happens only after “stability” is achieved;no one could recover in face of repeated crisis,hospitalisation or unrelenting psychotic symptoms. Unfortunately two causes have resulted in a relative neglect of the concept of recovery from psychotic illness:the divide between mainstream biologically oriented psychiatry and the psychiatric rehabilitation movement;the misunderstanding fact that term “recovery movement” is sometimes construed as anti-medication or anti-psychiatry orientation. Irrefuteble point is that recovery model not rejects the importance of remission:stability and relapse prevention. The recovery model besides asserts that achieving remission is the beginning and not the end of treatment plan:then there will be continued efforts to work with patient,family,caregiver,to continue to achieve further improvements in life goals. The “Recovery” patient-centred model have to be embraced as prymary goal by mainstream organizations and services in Mental Health.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

Paraphilic disorders are defined as persistent, intense and atypical forms of sexual excitement that appear with clinically significant functional impairment. The original clinical use of the terms sadism and masochism was to describe the sexual perversions of attaining sexual pleasure by hurting or being hurt. These terms have been usefully expanded to mean emotional sadism and masochism: experiencing emotional satisfaction or comfort due to exercising power over another or submitting to another’s power. This disorder begins at an early age and most sadists and masochists are actually satisfied with their unconventional sexual activity. Personality disorders are divided into three groups: A, B, and C, based on descriptive similarities. Group B in the classification of personality disorder is composed of an antisocial, histrionic, borderline and narcissistic personality disorder. People who fall into this group are characterized by impulsiveness and emotional instability, in their behavior they are dramatic and mischievous. Unlike true love, falling in love by itself is not a conscious choice nor a willing act. Love constitutes a voluntary act with which spritiual growth and maturity of ourselves and others is achieved. Similarly, love is action, not a feeling. In every long-lasting romantic relationship, including sadomasochistic ones, mutual respect and paying atttention play a major role.",

However, ED may be a regular and more severe problem in some men. It can cause low self-esteem, performance anxiety, depression and stress, and may also affect the quality of a marriage or intimate relationships. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, participating in more exercise, stopping smoking and minimising the risk of heart disease, may help to improve the condition. The introduction of the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of ED. Surgery may be considered when these inhibitors and other approaches fail or are contraindicated.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a common clinical issue with varying definitions depending on the source. The DSM-V defines insomnia disorder as one or more of: difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning wakening with an inability to fall back asleep. These problems occur despite adequate time allowed for sleep (7 hours), cause dysfunction, and are not attributed to another disorder. The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common clinical symptom affecting almost every person at some point in their life. Although most acute episodes of LBP are self-limiting, recurrent pain occurs in about 50–75% of individuals within 1 year. For the majority of patients, LBP is a chronic-recurrent problem and thus initial treatment recommendations should focus on long-term active approaches to health and well-being. Psychosocial and affective factors are the best predictors of an episode of acute LBP transitioning to a chronic pain state. These include depression, anxiety, trauma, social marginalization, passive coping, and fear. Exercise is generally the best supported treatment for LBP, although there are no real data to suggest that any one particular approach is uniquely beneficial. Excessive rest, unnecessary imaging, negative language, inaccurate and unhelpful diagnoses, excessive activity restrictions, and reliance on generally unhelpful or overtly harmful medications lead to iatrogenic disability and worse outcomes.",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

About 1% of 5-year-olds and as many as 1.5% of 7- to 8-year-olds are estimated to exhibit fecal soiling or incontinence, also known as encopresis. Symptoms of encopresis frequently begin after an illness. They can also result from psychosocial stressors, inappropriate toilet training, or in conjunction with a behavior disorder. Enuresis is an elimination disorder characterized by the repeated voiding of urine in inappropriate places (e.g., bed, clothing, floor) at least twice per week for 3 consecutive months. Enuresis can be specified as one of three types: nocturnal only, diurnal only, or nocturnal and diurnal.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by obsessions or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and senseless thoughts, images, or impulses that occur repeatedly. Obsessions are experienced as unwanted and involuntary by the patient and can focus on such themes as contamination, aggression, orderliness, religion, sex:, doubt, or loss of possessions. Compulsions are ritualistic but seemingly purposeful behaviors that are often performed in response to an obsession. These compulsive behaviors, either observable or mental, alleviate or neutralize anxiety associated with the obsession. The patient fears the outcome should he or she not perform the ritual, despite the knowledge that the fear is irrational. Because the ritual does not entirely relieve the fear, the impulse to repeat the ritual returns. Common compulsive behaviors include hand-washing, checking, arranging, touching, repeating, or hoarding. Table 1 summarizes diagnostic criteria according to the American Psychiatric Association. l Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs at some point during a lifetime in approximately 2.5 to 3 percent of the population; it is equally common in men as in women, and one-third of the cases begin by the age of 15 years.2 As with many other psychiatric illnesses, patients might not seek care until years after the onset of the disease. A variety of causes have been proposed: behavioral, developmental, biochemical, psychological, and genetic. Familial tendencies have been seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one sample of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 71 percent had a parent with either full-blown obsessive-compulsive disotder or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.3 The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder have also previously been viewed as extreme variants of normal developmental rituals",

      "abstract": "This manuscript presents working definitions for key clinical course indicators for bipolar disorder, including response, remission, relapse, recurrence, and roughening.A work group of experts in bipolar disorder reviewed prior efforts to define clinical course indicators for unipolar depression and for schizophrenia. Using these efforts as templates, the work group developed consensus operational definitions. The rationale for each of the definitions was a point of time when a treatment decision needed to be made.The group defined response as a 50% reduction in a score from a standard rating scale of symptomatology from an appropriate baseline, regardless of index episode type (manic, depressed, or mixed). In addition, the other pole cannot be significantly worsened during response. Remission was defined as absence or minimal symptoms of both mania and depression for at least 1 week. Sustained remission requires at least eight consecutive weeks of remission, and perhaps as many as 12 weeks. A relapse/recurrence was defined as a return to the full syndrome criteria of an episode of mania, mixed episode, or depression following a remission of any duration. Roughening was defined as a return of symptoms at a subsyndromal level, perhaps representing a prodrome of an impending episode.The work group recommends that all reports of clinical trials in bipolar disorder include results using these definitions. This will introduce standards for such reports. Hopefully, the definitions will be revised and improved over time.",

The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Conversion disorder has one or more symptoms that affect voluntary motor or sensory function suggesting a neurological or other medical condition, but they are inconsistent with known neurological or musculoskeletal pathologies. Individuals with conversion disorder do not intentionally produce or feign their symptoms. Instead, the symptoms are due to an unconscious expression of a psychological conflict or need. There might be associated primary and secondary gains which act as maintaining factors. The disorder is more common in adolescence than in childhood. CASE REPORT: A 17 years old male reported to the Emergency Department alleged history of fall from a 10 feet wall c/o neck pain, inability to move all 4 limbs, diminished sensation below the neck. Cervical immobilization was done and his vitals & routine blood investigations were found to be normal. No signs of any urinary retention or fecal incontinence. Routine neurological examination was performed which revealed hypotonia in all 4 limbs with flaccidity with a power of 0/5 and diminished sensation at the level of C3. Neuro imaging was done. MRI brain with cervical screening revealed no edema, cord compression. MRI CERVICAL SPINE – NORMAL. Stressor: He was convicted under POSCO act for 3 years, 2 days before the incident. Neurosurgeon ruled out the physical cause of the above presentation. Detailed history revealed he was being convicted for 3 years for a marrying a 17 years old girl with her consent under POSCO act 2 days prior to the incident. He was seen distressed after hearing the verdict, had sleep disturbances, remained aloof, not communicating with others. He attempted suicide by jumping from the wall. He had a history of occasional cannabis use for the past 2 years. Family history revealing possession attacks in his mother. He was raised by a single parent as his father left him and his mother when he was 5 years old. He had no episodes of similar illness in the past. His temperament revealed that he had difficulty in adjustment to the situations being impulsive and had self-injurious behavior. Mental status examination revealed that the patient was lying in supine position, not able to move his all 4 limbs with obvious psychomotor retardation decreased talks, sad mood. DISCUSSION: The clinical picture is indicative of Dissociative Motor Disorder F44.4 according to ICD 10. After taking a detailed history, it was clear that he was extremely distressed regarding his punishment under POSCO act as he willfully married a 17 years old girl with her consent which could not stand in the court of law. Patient was started on therapy sessions as well as low-dose diazepam. In the sessions, possible causes of these symptoms were discussed, his family members were also psycho-educated about the psychosomatic nature of the symptoms and advised to encourage him for a symptom-free lifestyle. They were also given an instruction not to pay attention to his complaints of physical nature. Psychotherapy sessions were started in which all her stressors were therapy discussed. CONCLUSION: Conversion disorder, somatoform disorder, and malingering always remain a diagnostic challenge for the clinicians. The prompt history taking, identification of stressors, use of appropriate and validated physical examination manoeuvres, and coordination of care and information exchange between all family members and medical team may facilitate the expeditious care of these patients in a cost-effective manner. Psychogenic symptoms should be treated using suggestions, patience, and reassurance. Early recognition of a conversion disorder will limit unnecessary tests and medications. The quality of doctor-patient relationship can influence outcome. The existing literature supports a multidisciplinary treatment approach, with specific interventions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy for cognitive restructuring and psychodynamic therapy for addressing symptom connections to trauma and dissociation.",

In 2 cases the same allergic reaction was consciously provoked by a reapplication of the medicaments concerned during a following depressive phase; again with favourable results since under these conditions coincidences are not very probable, the conclusion can be made, and experimentally supported, that allergic drug reactions may be employed in the course of depressions, with careful avoidance of complications.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive compulsive disorder is a severe and disabling clinical condition that usually arises in late adolescence or early adulthood and, if left untreated, has a chronic course. Objectives To report and discuss a clinical case, followed by the authors. Aims/Methods Consultation of the patient's medical file, serial clinical evaluations and scientific literature review. Results 33 years-old male, married, degree in economics. Observed in the emergency room for having thoughts dominated by ideas of obsessive content, with a sense of self-reference, associated with recurrent compulsions as cleaning and checking rituals, consequential high levels of hopelessness and a depressive mood, with jeopardized chronobiological rhythms. This clinical condition started seven years before and seriously undermined the patient’s autonomy. Some of the difficulties outlined by the patient are: on his way to and from work, whenever he passed by a crosswalk he would circle the following roundabout several times, to confirm that he hadn't run over any pedestrian; at the end of the day, he would go through the same path in reverse, by bicycle, to confirm that no pedestrians had been run over by him. After two years of psychopharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy the patient showed significant clinical improvement. Conclusions On this case, the most likely diagnosis is an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The particularity of this case lays on its severity, given its evolution period, the psychopathological richness demonstrated and the functional commitment of the patient; and in the significant clinical improvements observed, largely due to optimal patient adherence to treatment.",

      "title": "Effects of SSRIs on Sexual Function",
      "abstract": "Sexual problems are highly prevalent in both men and women and are affected by, among other factors, mood state, interpersonal functioning, and psychotropic medications.The incidence of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction is difficult to estimate because of the potentially confounding effects of the illness itself, social and interpersonal comorbidities, medication effects, and design and assessment problems in most studies. Estimates of sexual dysfunction vary from a small percentage to more than 80%. This article reviews current evidence regarding sexual side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Among the sexual side effects most commonly associated with SSRIs are delayed ejaculation and absent or delayed orgasm. Sexual desire (libido) and arousal difficulties are also frequently reported, although the specific association of these disorders to SSRI use has not been consistently shown. The effects of SSRIs on sexual functioning seem strongly dose-related and may vary among the group according to serotonin and dopamine reuptake mechanisms, induction of prolactin release, anticholinergic effects, inhibition of nitric oxide synthetase, and propensity for accumulation over time. A variety of strategies have been reported in the management of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, including waiting for tolerance to develop, dosage reduction, drug holidays, substitution of another antidepressant drug, and various augmentation strategies with 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2), 5-HT3, and [small alpha, Greek]2 adrenergic receptor antagonists, 5-HT1A and dopamine receptor agonists, and phosphodiesterase (PDE5) enzyme inhibitors. Sexual side effects of SSRIs should not be viewed as entirely negative; some studies have shown improved control of premature ejaculation in men. The impacts of sexual side effects of SSRIs on treatment compliance and on patients' quality of life are important clinical considerations. (J Clin Psychopharmacol 1999;19:67-85)",

Stress can exert various negative effects on the body ranging from alterations in homeostasis to life-threatening effects and death. Erectile dysfunction can be a manifestation of chronic stress. ED is the most common male sexual dysfunction that affects 10-25% of middle-aged and elderly men. ED may result from many etiologic factors like psychogenic, endocrino- logic, neurogenic, arteriogenic or venoocclusive dysfunction. These factors are not mutually exclusive and multi- ple factors contribute to ED in many patients. According to modern science Psychogenic factors frequently coex- ist with other etiologic factors and should be considered in all cases. A patient aged 35 years came to the OPD of A&amp;U Tibbia college with complaints of inability to initiate and maintain erection along with abnormal vision, dizziness, retrosternal burning, indigestion, heaviness in chest and disinterest. He was advised for Shirodhara along with counselling (Satvvajaychikitsa) and after a couple of days, there was a significant improvement in pa- tient. In this case study, we are trying to highlight the contribution of stress &amp; psyche on male sexual dysfunction and its management through Satvavajaychikitsa (counselling) and Shirodhara.

A patient is associated with major depression when he or she possesses at least five of these clinical symptoms; sadness (also known as depressed mood), lack of concentration, sleeping disorder such as insomnia and hypersomnia, fatigue, loss of interest, lack of appetite, excessive guilt, unworthy feeling and suicidal thoughts. The mentioned symptoms should be present for a minimum period of two weeks for the diagnosis of major depression to be established. Left untreated, major depressive disorder may interfere with daily life activities and eventually leads to suicide, which is one of the leading cause of death in the United States. In this report, the referred case study for major depressive disorder will be the scenario of a 30 year old woman who attempted suicide by consuming 8 bodrex pills. She was given psychotherapy and treated with antidepressant of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor group which indeed showed a good improvement on her health.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive. Specify if: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.",

At least 15% of women on OCs were classified as suffering from depression. Other symptoms were nausea headache increase of appetite anxiety increased or decreased libido.

      "title": "How sexuality is affected and managed in patients under antipsychotic drugs",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a prevalent side effect of antipsychotic drugs (AP), and it impairs patients’ quality of life. Because of the distress caused by it, it should be borne in mind when prescribed since it is responsible for treatment nonadherence or discontinuation. SD affects about 45- 80% of males and 30-80% of females that take it. In SD, all phases of the sexual response cycle may be compromised. Objectives This non-systematic review of the literature aims to better understand the antipsychotic-induced SD and its management to better compliance of AP-treated patients without compromising their quality of life. Methods A semi-structured review on PubMed linking SD as a side effect of AP drugs. Results All AP drugs can cause SD. It seems related to their mechanism of activity at receptors D2, 5-HT2, α1, H1, and M, which are also involved in sexual function. They do it by diminishing arousal, decreasing libido by blocking motivation and reward system and orgasm indirectly, provoking erectile dysfunction by vasodilatation, and decreasing woman lubrification. Hyperprolactinemia is a significant cause of sexual dysfunctions. Haloperidol, Risperidone, and Amisulpride (prolactin elevating AP) are more likely to cause SD than Olanzapine, Clozapine, Quetiapine, and Aripiprazole (prolactin sparing AP). Although psychotic disorders (Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders) can impact sexual functioning, according to evidence, there is no denying the role of AP in this issue. Aripiprazole, a D2 partial agonist, has been associated with lower rates of SD and seems to reduce the rates of SD in patients previously treated with other AP. Other AP with the same potential dopamine agonist activity, such as Cariprazine and Brexpiprazole, can probably have the same effect. The management of SD induced by AP drugs should include measuring serum prolactin and modifying risk factors like hypertension, smoking, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia. In that regard, waiting for spontaneous remission, reducing the dose of the AP prescribed, or switching to Aripiprazole are all viable strategies, if possible. Although the evidence supporting the addition of symptomatic therapies is weak, adding dopaminergic drugs (amantadine, bromocriptine, cabergoline) or drugs with specific effects on sexual functioning (such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors or yohimbine) may be helpful in selected cases. Conclusions Although all AP drugs can cause sexual dysfunction, it is difficult to determine its true prevalence accurately. AP-induced sexual dysfunction can adversely affect compliance and is one of the factors that must be considered when selecting treatment. In summarizing, Aripiprazole has shown to be the AP with the most favorable profile concerning SD. Cariprazine and Brexpiprazole, being also D2 partial agonists, may cause less SD.

In older people, the relationship between depression and impaired social functioning and quality of life is complex and ill defined. Despite well-tolerated and effective treatments, many depressed individuals are undiagnosed or under-treated. The impact of depression on the quality of life (QOL) and social functioning of older people can be considerable. Furthermore, impairment of social functioning, consequent on the social isolation and functional disability that goes hand-in-hand with ageing, may be a causative factor in old age depression. Once depression develops, it may result in further narrowing of social repertoire, compounding the problem. Notwithstanding some of the difficulties in measuring social functioning and quality of life, progress has been made in defining the extent of these problems in older depressed individuals. The impact treatment of depression has on these parameters is becoming increasingly recognised and evaluated in clinical trials.",

Surgical intervention to decompress affected organs or area of the body is often the only effective treatment, although evidences to assess the best timing of intervention are lacking. Present paper systematically reviewed the literature stratifying timings according to the compartmental syndromes which may beneficiate from immediate, early, delayed, or prophylactic surgical decompression. Timing of decompression have been stratified into four categories: (1) immediate decompression for those compartmental syndromes whose missed therapy would rapidly lead to patient death or extreme disability, (2) early decompression with the time burden of 3–12 h and in any case before clinical signs of irreversible deterioration, (3) delayed decompression identified with decompression performed after 12 h or after signs of clinical deterioration has occurred, and (4) prophylactic decompression in those situations where high incidence of compartment syndrome is expected after a specific causative event.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction often accompanies severe psychiatric illness and can be due to both the mental disorder itself and the use of psychotropic treatments. Many sexual symptoms resolve as the mental state improves, but treatment-related sexual adverse events tend to persist over time, and are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians and scarcely investigated in clinical trials. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction adversely affects quality of life and may contribute to reduce treatment adherence. There are important differences between the various compounds in the incidence of adverse sexual effects, associated with differences in mechanisms of action. Antidepressants with a predominantly serotonergic activity, antipsychotics likely to induce hyperprolactinaemia, and mood stabilizers with hormonal effects are often linked to moderate or severe sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, delayed orgasm, anorgasmia, and sexual arousal difficulties. Severe mental disorders can interfere with sexual function and satisfaction, while patients wish to preserve a previously satisfactory sexual activity. In many patients, a lack of intimate relationships and chronic deterioration in mental and physical health can be accompanied by either a poor sexual life or a more frequent risky sexual behaviour than in the general population. Here we describe the influence of psychosis and antipsychotic medications, of depression and antidepressant drugs, and of bipolar disorder and mood stabilizers on sexual health, and the optimal management of patients with severe psychiatric illness and sexual dysfunction.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development.

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

      "abstract": "Over 75% of depressed patients in primary care complain of painful physical symptoms such as headache, stomach pain, neck and back pain aswell as non-specific generalized pain. The presence of such symptoms predicts a greater severity and a less favourable outcome of depression with a poorer health-related quality of life. World Health Organization data obtained in primary care centres worldwide show that 22% of all primary care patients suffer from persistent debilitating pain and that these patients are four times more likely to have co-morbid anxiety or depressive disorder than pain-free primary care patients. Not unexpectedly, the risk of depression is greater when the pain is more diffuse, as indicated by the number of painful sites, and has a greater effect on the quality of life. Certain depressive symptoms, such as low energy and sleep disturbances, are commonly found in patients with co-morbid pain, whereas the opposite is true for symptoms such as guilt and loneliness. Increasingly, major depression is seen as being composed of psychological, somatic and painful physical symptoms. In order to achieve full sustained remission it is necessary to treat symptoms in all three of these areas. The area of painful physical symptoms is unfortunately still poorly understood and clearly merits greater attention. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affecting up to 7% of reproductive age women. Women with PMDD are of reproductive age; therefore, contraception and treatment of PMDD are important considerations. The disorder as described in the DSM-V is characterized by moderate to severe psychological, behavioral and physical symptoms beginning up to two weeks prior to menses, resolving soon after the onset of menstruation and significantly interfering with daily functioning. PMDD develops in predisposed individuals after they are exposed to progesterone at the time of ovulation. It has been hypothesized that PMDD is in part attributable to luteal phase abnormalities in serotonergic activity and to altered configuration of ℽ-aminobutyric acid subunit A (GABAA) receptors in the brain triggered by the exposure to the neuroactive steroid progesterone metabolite, allopregnanolone (Allo). A large body of evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be effective in the treatment of PMDD. Combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) pills, specifically the 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/3mg drospirenone in a 24/4 extended cycle regimen has been shown to significantly improve the emotional and physical symptoms of PMDD. Other combined monophasic, extended cycle hormonal contraceptive pills with less androgenic progestins may also be helpful, although not well studied. Copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) are recommended for those not seeking hormonal contraceptives. Progestin-only methods including the progestin-only pill (POP), levonorgestrel (LNG) IUD, etonorgestrel implant or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) have the potential to negatively affect mood symptoms for women with or without baseline mood disorders, including PMDD. Careful counseling and close follow-up is recommended for patients with PMDD seeking these contraceptive methods.",

Manifestations of PMS include: nervousness, depression, irritability, insomnia, headaches, breast enlargement, abdominal bloating, oedema, gastrointestinal upsets, skin disorders antisocial behavior and psychosexual aberrations. Hormonal changes are probably the main etiological factor and the newest approach to management consists of inhibition of ovulation by means of estradiol implants. Although emotional and psychiatric symptoms are prominent, psychiatric treatment is disappointing. PMS is simply a response to biochemical and metabolic changes following ovulation; distressing PMS represents a psychological maladjustment to these hormonal tides.",

      "abstract": "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) comprises about 5% of ad cases and is associated with delays in diagnosis and aggressive course. Psychotic symptoms are frequent in ad and often include delusions of infidelity and hallucinations. When present, ad with psychosis is accompanied by elevated levels of depression and greater functional impairment. This case expands upon the existing literature on EOAD through the timeline of a complex psychosis presentation accompanied by rapid cognitive decline.63-year-old, Hispanic, woman with progressive cognitive changes (e.g., confusion, forgetfulness, word-finding difficulties, disorganization) that emerged 5 years prior to seeking neurological consultation. Psychosis symptoms (i.e., auditory/visual hallucinations, delusions), in the context of real events (i.e., husband's previous infidelity), developed simultaneously. These pervasive symptoms have contributed to social withdrawal, persistent suicidal tendencies, and impaired IADLs. Neuroimaging suggested hypometabolism in the parietotemporal regions with precuneus and posterior cingulate gyri involvement.The evaluation revealed fairly generalized cognitive decline. Basic attention, working memory, visual abstract reasoning, and phonemic fluency were intact. Visual integration/visuoconstruction were reduced. Impairments emerged in processing speed, rapid cognitive flexibility, cognitive inhibition, conceptualization, visuospatial orientation, semantic fluency, confrontation naming, and visual and verbal encoding and retention (with rapid forgetting). She endorsed moderately elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety.The pattern of cognitive and functional deficits are all suggestive of an ad process. Her age, sex, significant neuroimaging findings, report of earliest cognitive symptoms, and family history reinforce an EOAD etiology. Significant behavioral changes are often associated with increased cognitive impairment and in turn, may mark the progression/stage of the disease.",

      "title": "Galantamine in the Treatment of Minor Depression With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Dementia in an Elderly Woman",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Depression is present in about 20%–40% of dementia patients; 15%–50% of Alzheimer's dementia patients have depression.1,2 Depression is common in the early stages of the disease and remains fairly constant through most stages of Alzheimer's dementia.3 Depression exacerbates the cognitive deficits of the preexisting dementia. In Alzheimer's dementia, mild to moderate depression may also manifest as new onset of agitation, wandering, apathy, insomnia, or change in functional status. Depressive symptoms in dementia should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable “excess disability.”4\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, an 80-year-old woman, presented with a 2-year history of cognitive decline and an 8-month history of minor depression. Depression features included low mood with decreased interest in social activities, being less energetic, psychomotor slowing, and being more withdrawn and lonely. Sleep and appetite were good. She met only 3 of the 9 features of the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Her Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)5 score was 11/30. Her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia6 score for depression in dementia was 13. Her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)7 score was 22/30, and she met the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer's dementia. Computed tomography scan of the brain revealed generalized atrophy.\r\n\r\nMs A was started on galantamine 8 mg orally twice a day, which was subsequently increased to 16 mg orally twice a day after 4 weeks. Her minor depression features responded very well with galantamine monotherapy after 2 months. At that time, her MMSE score was 23/30, her GDS score was 4/30, and her Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was 6.\r\n\r\nDepression is associated with defects of multiple neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, catecholamine, and acetylcholine. Depression in Alzheimer's dementia is linked to catecholaminergic deficit or degeneration of serotonergic neurons, and this process is also known to occur early in Alzheimer's dementia.8\r\n\r\nGalantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is used in the treatment of dementia. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exist not only on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites but also on those located on axon terminals and are involved in the modulation of multiple neurotransmitter releases. Neuronal nAChR is a family of ligand-gated ion channels that are widely distributed in the brain and are controlled by acetylcholine and nicotine receptor agonists. In the genetically depressive rats, nicotine showed antidepressant-like effects through the involvement of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype. The α4 subunit in combination with the β2 subunit mediates dopaminergic and nonadrenergic release.9 Modulation of nAChR facilitates the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate.10 Striatal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with high affinity for nicotinic agonists are involved with the release of a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine.11 Dopamine deficiency is associated with anhedonia, lack of interest, and psychomotor slowing (bradyphrenia), and it may arise as a consequence of cholinergic defects involving nAChR. Studies suggest galantamine in addition to mediating cholinergic neurotransmission also through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may influence several other neurotransmitter systems, possibly modulating the activity of serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and GABA in certain nerve tracts.12,13 So, it is possible that galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of dementia, may also have some antidepressant effect.\r\n\r\nIf large studies prove this effect, we may not need to use an antidepressant in addition to a cholinesterase inhibitor in patients who have depression with dementia. This means less medication usage and potentially less adverse effect to these patients.",

The bases of these classifications are most varied, involving consideration of the extent and nature of the psychopathology present (for example, neurotic versus psychotic depression, agitated depression, retarded depression, smiling depression, hypochrondriacal depression); longitudinal history of the patient (recording, for example, manicdepressive illness, circular type, in a person who, in the course of one or several episodes of illness, has exhibited mood swings to both the manic and the depressive poles, or endogenous-reactive depression, determined on the basis of the presence or absence of clear and meaningful precipating events); and demographic data such as age (pointing, for example, to early onset versus late onset depression, or to involutional depression in illness occurring in elderly males or in menopausal or postmenopausal females). One very important basis of classification that has been largely neglected, but that would have considerable value from an etiologic viewpoint, is a genetic one. There is considerable evidence that genetic factors are important in affective disorders. Winokur & Pitts (1965) found a greater prevalence of both affective disorder and alcoholism in parents of affectively ill patients than in parents of a control group of medical, surgical, and obstetrical patients who had been matched for age, sex, ward versus private-room status, and marital status. These results appear in Table 1, in which it can be seen that for three other psychiatric disordersneurosis, schizophrenia, and chronic brain syndromethere was no significant increase in comparison with the control figures. The finding of a greater prevalence of alcoholism in fathers of affective patients further suggests a genetic trait, according to Hanna (1965), who proposed as one criterion of a",

In youth, these intrusion symptoms often manifest as repetitive play, frightening dreams without recognizable content, and trauma-specific re-enactment during play. Youth who have PTSD may also experience persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma (Criterion C), negative alterations in cognitions and moods (Criterion D), and hyperarousal and reactivity, often with little or no provocation (Criterion E). There are some minor differences in the diagnostic criteria for children younger than six years of age (e.g., fewer symptoms needed for diagnosis), and all symptoms must be considered in the context of the individual’s developmental stage and in light of pre-trauma functioning.",

      "abstract": "The sexual dysfunctions are extremely common but are rarely recognized by primary care physicians. They represent inhibitions in the appetitive or psychophysiologic changes that characterize the complete adult sexual response and are classified into four major categories: (1) sexual desire disorders (hypoactive sexual desire, sexual aversion disorder), (2) sexual arousal disorders (female sexual arousal disorder, male erectile dysfunction), (3) orgasmic disorders (inhibited male or female orgasm, premature ejaculation), and (4) sexual pain disorders (dyspareunia, vaginismus).Articles about the sexual dysfunctions were obtained from a search of MEDLINE files from 1966 to the present using the categories as key words, along with the general key word \"sexual dysfunction.\" Additional articles came from the reference lists of dysfunction-specific reviews.Cause and pathogenesis span a continuum from organic to psychogenic and most often include a mosaic of factors. Organic factors include chronic illness, pregnancy, pharmacologic agents, endocrine alterations, and a host of other medical, surgical, and traumatic factors. Psychogenic factors include an array of individual factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, fear, frustration, guilt hypochondria, intrapsychic conflict), interpersonal and relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, relationship conflict, diminished trust, fear of intimacy, poor relationship models, family system conflict), psychosexual factors (e.g., negative learning and attitudes, performance anxiety, prior sexual trauma, restrictive religiosity, intellectual defenses), and sexual enactment factors (e.g., skill and knowledge deficits, unrealistic performance expectations). Understanding the cause and pathophysiology of sexual disorders will help primary care physicians diagnose these problems accurately and manage them effectively.",

Post-partum depression, which has a prevalence of 10-15%, is more serious in that it may last for several months and impair a woman's ability to function in her many roles. Clinically and with respect to causal factors post-partum depression appears to resemble depression occurring at other times. Post-partum psychosis is a disabling disorder occurring once in every 1000 deliveries. Intensive treatment, usually on an inpatient basis, is required.

DSM-IV-TR categorizes medication-induced sexual dysfunction as a type of substance-induced sexual dysfunction.

Zimmerman et al (4) compared psychiatrists' clinical assessments of depressed patients receiving ongoing treatment with results of a standardized side effects questionnaire and found that even though psychiatrists regularly inquired about sexual side effects, on the questionnaire patients reported higher rates of almost all sexual dysfunctions. The incidence of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction also can be difficult to ascertain because some sexual dysfunctions frequently accompany a primary psychiatric disorder (5) or physical illness. Balon (6) suggested that the incidence of SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction is 30% to 50%, although others have reported higher incidences. Few quality studies have focused on identifying the exact nature and causes of SSRI treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction. This article describes mechanisms that may be fundamental to SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction. Not just serotonin Although SSRIs are relatively selective for the serotonergic system, they affect other neurotransmitter systems as well (Table 2, page 32) (7) For example, at high dosages paroxetine is believed to block norepinephrine reuptake, and it has a clinically significant anticholinergic effect. …",

Einleitend wird auf die Sorgfaltspflicht eines Lenkers verwiesen. Jeder Kraftfahrer hat sich vor der Inbetriebnahme eines Fahrzeuges stets zu vergewissern, dass er nach seinen koerperlichen und geistigen Faehigkeiten dazu (noch) imstande ist, den Anforderungen des Strassenverkehrs zu genuegen. Wirkungen oder Nebenwirkungen von Medikamenten koennen eine Reihe von physischen oder psychischen Stoerungen verursachen, welche die Verkehrstauglichkeit herabsetzen. Als verkehrsmedizinisch relevant muessen alle Pharmaka gelten, die einen zentralen Angriffspunkt haben. Die Wirkungen der in Betracht kommenden Medikamente haengen jedoch von verschiedensten Faktoren und der individuellen Situation des Betroffenen ab. Prinzipiell ist zu sagen, dass eine medikamentenbedingte Fahruntuechtigkeit ein normatives Tatbestandsmerkmal ist, dem ein vorsaetzliches oder fahrlaessiges Verhalten zugrunde liegen kann. Die rechtliche Entscheidung ueber die Verschuldensfrage und die Schuldform haengt davon ab, ob und gegebenenfalls wie der betroffene Lenker vor oder waehrend der Fahrt die Wirkung der konsumierten Medikamente im Hinblick auf seine Fahrsicherheit beurteilt hat und beurteilen musste. Da jeder Fahrzeuglenker vor Antritt der Fahrt verpflichtet ist, seine Fahrtuechtigkeit zu pruefen, handelt er im Falle einer mangelnden eigenen Vorsorge fahrlaessig. Auf die verschiedenen Moeglichkeiten eines Kraftfahrers, eine Fahruntuechtigkeit vorauszusehen, wird eingegangen. Ein Kraftfahrer, der sich gegen aerztlichen Rat nach Einnahme eines Medikamentes ans Steuer setzt, handelt schuldhaft. Der Autor geht weiters auf Arzneimittelinteraktionen bei Einnahme von 2 oder mehreren Medikamenten gleichzeitig, auf das Zusammenwirken von Medikamenten und Alkohol sowie auf alkoholhaltige Medikamente und die im jeweiligen Fall zu erfuellenden Sorgfaltspflichten des Lenkers ein.

      "abstract": "The term sella (ESS) indicates the presence of an enlarged Sella turcica which contains a remodeled pituitary gland by pressing it against the back and lower wall of the sellar space. The condition is the result of the expansion of the subarachnoid space in the sella as a result of the incomplete continuity of the sellar diaphragm. There are two types of empty sella syndrome (ESS) with a difference in repercussions on the endocrine system. Therefore, with regard to etiology, empty Sella syndrome may be primary, if there is no pathological process in the selar region itself which is the cause of damage to the pituitary gland, or secondary, if it was caused by a specific pathological process. Primary empty sella syndrome (PESS) may be an incidental finding or can be registered with imaging methods of examination of patients presented with endocrine disorders, neurological symptoms, visual disturbances, etc. It may be caused by intracranial hypertension and/or selar diaphragm insufficiency in patients who have not previously documented any pathology of the pituitary gland. Secondary empty sella syndrome (SESS) is much more frequent and associated with various pathological conditions and processes of the selar region. The presence of intrasellar masses changes the normal anatomy of the diaphragm, stretching, enlarging and thining it, and increases the chances of developing arachnoid adhesions that can withdraw the SVS to the sellar cavity. Radiotherapy, surgery, medication therapy, infections, post-partum pituitary necrosis, trauma and spontaneous resolution may induce a reduction in the sellar mass and stimulate the emergence of secondary empty sella syndrome associated with the development of scar tissue tissues, which after a few months of retraction can pull the supraselar structures causing visual deficits. The disease is treated appropriately to the disorder-medical therapy of endocrine disorders, surgical excision of intrasellar masses and adhesions and reduction of intracranial pressure.",

Most depressed patients also manifested anxious features (76% with a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ≥ 12). The presence of anxiety was related to the severity of depression, work absenteeism, and current social instability. Depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score ≤ 26, including the contributions of anxious symptoms), psychiatric comorbidity, and psychomotor retardation best predicted continued work absenteeism. Patients with major depression were more likely to receive an antidepressant if they had a past history of depressive episodes and/or previous work disability. Patients with minor depression were less likely to receive drug therapy than patients with major depression, despite their current work disability. Among patients who received fluoxetine or a tricyclic antidepressant for at least 8 weeks, fluoxetine was associated with statistically significantly lower mean anxiety and depression scores and fewer work days missed.",

With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "Several groups of pharmacological agents have been reported to disrupt normal sexual function. Psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, have also been associated with sexual side effects. The procedure by which, the basic physiologic mechanisms of the normal sexual phases (libido, arousal, and orgasm) are disrupted by some psychotropics provide a framework to minimize sexual side effects when initiating and continuing treatment. Successful management of sexual complaints during treatment should begin with a systematic approach to determine the type of sexual dysfunction, potential contributing factors, and finally delineating strategies that should be tailored to the individual patient. This article provides guidelines for the assessment, management, and prevention of sexual side effects associated with antidepressant and antipsychotic treatment.",

A simplified interpretation of this definition is presented in Figure 91.1. Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident). On the other hand, person with single episode of an alcohol-related problem is not necessarily an alcoholic; in such case, the condition may be better termed alcohol abuse.",

En la epilepsia catamenial, su patron de ocurrencia de CE es predecible y ciclico (75%); probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales del periodo menstrual, observandose acentuacion de las CE en los 2 a 3 dias previos a la misma, y con el primer y segundo dias de sangrado menstrual. Metodologia: realizamos una investigacion tipo clinico experimental prospectivo con grupo control, sobre la evolucion clinica de 11 pacientes que presentaban EA con patron ciclico de los cuales 6 recibieron terapia intermitente profilactica con midazolam y 5 pacientes intermitente de ataque con midazolam durante 8 meses. Resultados: Disminucion en la frecuencia de CE en acumulos, mayor al 50% en quienes recibieron tratamiento profilactico con MDZ; contrario a las pacientes con tratamiento de ataque con MDZ, quienes no modificaron la frecuencia de su EA. Conclusiones: El MDZ surge como terapia profilactica eficaz en el control de la epilepsia catamenial en acumulos. El midazolam se plantea como alternativa eficaz para el manejo de EA; planteandose que su utilizacion por V.O, ofrece facil administracion y seguridad.",

Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not. Emergent EEG examination should be a routine part of evaluation in these children for the diagnosis and treatment of NCSE.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Ejaculatory dysfunction is a common complaint and is often associated with a reduced quality of life for sufferer and partner. The spectrum of ejaculatory dysfunction extends from premature ejaculation ( PE ) to delayed ejaculation ( DE ) and anejaculation. Over the past 20–30 years, the PE treatment paradigm, previously limited to behavioural psychotherapy, has expanded to include drug treatment. Multiple well‐controlled, evidence‐based studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors in delaying ejaculation, confirming their role as first‐line agents for the treatment of lifelong and acquired PE . More recently, there has been increased attention to the psychosocial consequences of PE , its epidemiology, its aetiology and its pathophysiology by both clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry. DE and anejaculation are probably the least common, least studied and least understood of the male sexual dysfunctions. However, their impact is significant as they may result in a lack of sexual fulfilment for both the man and his partner, an effect further compounded when procreation is among the couple's goals of sexual intercourse. The causes of DE , anejaculation and anorgasmia are manifold. Numerous psychotherapeutic treatments are described for the management of delayed or anejaculation. Although some appear to be effective, none has been properly evaluated in large‐scale samples. Treatment of DE or anejaculation with pharmacotherapy has met with limited success. No drugs have been approved by regulatory agencies for this purpose, and most drugs that have been identified for potential use have limited efficacy, impart significant side‐effects or are yet considered experimental in nature.",

If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 1a and “No” to Question 1b (parent reports past depression but denies current episode), the interviewer should assess suicide risk (Questions 12a–12d) and then skip to the section on Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). If the parent responds “Yes” to Question 12a, 12b, 12c, or 12d, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child's current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventative action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “Yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

These forces principally revolve around the parents’ fantasies of themselves, both as spouses and as parents. So deep and so strongly held are these fantasies that their threatened loss frequently precipitates acting out and regressive behavior. Often one or both of the parents may appear to be almost psychotic, when previously they were functioning quite well. Children are drawn into this maelstrom, often siding with one or the other parent in a very pathological fashion. Examples of regressive behavior as well as case examples are given.",

DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

An unrecorded number of new mothers experience lesser degrees of postpartum illness, and two distinct forms of severe illness can be distinguished. One form, called postpartum psychosis, is an agitated, very changeable condition, often characterized by confusion, hallucinations, delusions and sometimes episodes of violent behaviour. The other condition, major postpartum depression, begins two or three weeks after childbirth, and is characterized by confusion, depression of mood, and often with exhaustion, headache and digestive upset. Mixtures of the two severe disorders occur frequently. This volume contains a number of essays which support the position that postpartum disorders are primarily organic and are mainly disorders of hormonal deficit. They develop as the endocrine system falls back from the hyperactivity of pregnancy toward or beyond the levels of the prior non-pregnant state. Tremendous therapeutic opportunities exist or are imminent for both the organic and the psychological components of postpartum mental illness.",

The major complications are localised cortical subarachnoid haemorrhage (22%) and parenchymal ischaemic or haemorrhagic strokes (7%) which may leave permanent sequelae. Diagnosis requires the demonstration of the “string of beads” appearance of cerebral arteries on angiography, with complete or almost complete resolution on repeat angiography 12 weeks after onset.

About 15 percent of all older adults—twice as many women as men—suffer from dysthymia and other forms of mild depression. Some researchers, however, see the rates of dysthymia begin to balance more equally between the genders in the older population.",

Other common symptoms are including concentration and memory impairment, muscle and multiple joints pain, extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exertions, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms and depression, anxiety, mood swings and panic attacks. Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome—Psychiatric or Gynaecological Disorder?",
      "abstract": "The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of mental and physical symptoms arising in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms disappear after the onset of menstruation. During the rest of the follicular phase the patient is free from symptoms. The cyclical nature of the symptom variations is characteristic of the syndrome. The lack of a commonly accepted definition and a way to diagnose PMS has led to contradictory results in the search for its aetiology and treatment. The diagnosis of PMS should be based on prospective daily ratings of symptoms and defined criteria of subgroups. In our studies three subgroups can be identified. The \"Pure PMS\" group with significant cyclical symptoms being worse during the luteal phase and no symptoms during the follicular phase. A \"Premenstrual aggravation\" group with symptoms always present but with an aggravation premenstrually. A \"Non-PMS\" group of women who do not suffer from menstrual cycle related symptoms. These three groups show significant differences in the number of patients with an earlier psychiatric history and are different in the extent of neurosis on a personality test. The Pure PMS group had less neurosis and a lower frequency of patients with an earlier psychiatric history. In anovulatory cycles, whether induced or spontaneous, the cyclical nature of symptoms disappeared. This shows the important role that the corpus luteum has in precipitating symptoms in PMS. GnRH-agonists can be used to induce anovulation and this will stop the cyclical changes. Postmenopausal women receiving oestradiol/progestagen sequential treatment develop PMS-like symptoms when progestagen is added to the treatment. Symptoms seem to be dose dependent related to the oestradiol during the luteal but not the folicular phase. The intracerebral effects that cause the symptoms are still unknown. Progesterone metabolites have, however, been shown to interact with the GABA-A receptor in a similar manner to benzodiazepins and barbiturates, and they also have anxiolytic effects. Progesterone metabolites may occur which have the opposite effect on the GABA-A receptor, producing anxiogenic effects.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive synchronous neuronal activity of the brain.” The word seizure is of Greek origin, the root word being “seiein” which means “to shake”. “Epilepsy is a disease of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures.” It is also characterized by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the\r\ncondition. Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the three:\r\n1. Two or more unprovoked seizures which occurs >24 h apart.\r\n2. One unprovoked seizure and a chance of occurrence of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years.\r\n3. Diagnosis of an electro clinical syndrome.\r\nEpilepsy is said to be resolved in those children who had an age specific epilepsy syndrome but now have crossed that age group or children who have been seizure-free for the past ten years, with no antiepileptics for the past five years.\r\nOBJECTIVE:\r\nThe aim of the study was to identify the pattern of abnormalities in MRI and EEG in developmentally normal children presenting with new onset seizures.\r\nMETHODS:\r\nThe study was a prospective observational study conducted in our hospital, Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children for a period of six months. The study included children who presented with new onset seizures in the age group 2 months to 12 years. Children with simple febrile seizures, acute CNS infection, trauma, toxin, metabolic seizures, chronic neurological illness were excluded. All the children underwent complete neurological examination, MRI brain and EEG.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThe study included 100 children from 2months to 12 years. The results were statistically analyzed. The most common age group of children presenting new onset seizures was 6 to 12 years, mean age being 5.4 years. The commonest seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Eleven percent of the children presented with status epilepticus as the first episode of new onset seizures. MRI abnormalities were seen in 29% of the children most common finding being Ring enhancing lesion(65.5%). EEG abnormalities were seen in 38% of the children, commonest abnormality being generalized spikes(63.2%).\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\nRing enhancing lesion is the most common abnormality in neuroimaging detected in children presenting with new onset seizures. Generalized epileptiform activity is the commonest EEG abnormality noted in children with new onset seizures.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Además, una mayoría de las personas que intentan suicidarse tiene más de un diagnóstico. Esto es especialmente cierto si se tienen en cuenta los trastornos subumbral del Eje II o el Eje I. La existencia de un trastorno explica en gran parte la asociación entre la mayoría de las variables socioeconómicas (sexo, matrimonio, nivel educativo) y la suicidalidad. Los trastornos depresivos son el factor de riesgo principal, riesgo asociado probablemente a un episodio actual justo antes del intento. La asociación con episodios depresivos de un trastorno de ansiedad o la existencia de rasgos impulsivos (trastorno de la personalidad del grupo B, abuso de drogas o ambos) aumenta el riesgo de actuación. La ideación suicida y los intentos de suicidio muestran curvas de comienzo paralelas con picos entre los 14-20 años de edad, con la existencia de un diagnóstico previo del DSM-III-R como un predictor poderoso. El número de trastornos asociados aumenta linealmente la probabilidad de intentar el suicidio y es el único predictor significativo de la mortalidad. Un tratamiento adecuado de los trastornos mentales podría reducir sustancialmente la suicidalidad.",

The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

      "abstract": "Background In schizophrenia, patient reacts to sad news with cheerfulness or even laughter (Parathymia/Inappropriate affect). In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Die Frage des angemessenen Managements nach einem ersten epileptischen Anfall verursacht nicht selten Unsicherheit. Dies betrifft vier Themenbereiche: die Diagnostik; die Einschätzung des Rezidivrisikos; die Beratung des Patienten bezüglich einer antiepileptischen Pharmakotherapie sowie deren weiterer ärztlicher Begleitung; und die sozialmedizinische Bewertung (Fahreignung, berufliche Eignung). Methodik Zusammenfassung der relevanten Datenlage zu diesen Themenfeldern und daraus abgeleitete Empfehlungen zum praktischen Umgang mit ersten epileptischen Anfällen im erwerbsfähigen Alter. Ergebnis Nach der Klärung, ob es sich um einen epileptischen Anfall gehandelt hat, dient die Diagnostik einerseits dazu, akut-symptomatische und potenziell behandlungsbedürftige Ursachen zu erkennen, andererseits zur Abschätzung des Rezidivrisikos. Dieses hängt weniger davon ab, ob eine Epilepsie diagnostiziert werden kann. Risikoerhöhend sind vielmehr – auch additiv – das Vorliegen folgender Merkmale: epilepsietypische Aktivität im EEG, bildgebender Nachweis einer Hirnläsion, zerebrale Vorerkrankung oder Auftreten des Anfalls aus dem Schlaf. Je höher das Rezidivrisiko, desto stärker scheint der rezidivprophylaktische Effekt einer antiepileptischen Pharmakotherapie zu sein und desto eher wird man dafür optieren. Die Entscheidung hierüber wird gemeinsam mit dem Patienten getroffen unter Berücksichtigung seiner Präferenzen und seiner sozialen Situation (z. B. Angewiesensein auf die Fahreignung, berufliche Besonderheiten). In der weiteren Begleitung kommt der Sicherung der Adhärenz eine entscheidende Rolle zu. Für die Frist bis zur Wiedererlangung der Fahreignung und der Eignung, bestimmte berufliche Tätigkeiten (wieder) auszuüben, gibt es verbindliche Regelungen.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Biologically, an MS relapse (flare, exacerbation, attack) is defined as a clinical worsening due to a new or expanding area of CNS inflammation. Clinically, the change in neurologic symptoms and signs should persist for more than 48 hours. Only two conditions have been persuasively linked to an increased risk of relapses. These are the period 2 to 6 months postpartum, when a woman’s immune system readjusts to normal,1–4 and the period 1 to 5 weeks following an infection, usually a viral infection.5,6 The reason for the latter phenomenon is not known but is believed to result from a stimulation of the immune system following its response to the infectious agent. Making the diagnosis of an MS relapse can be difficult. Many factors can contribute to a worsening of symptoms and signs in persons with MS that are not the result of new CNS inflammation. Worsening of signs and symptoms resulting from non–MS-related disease processes is called a “pseudorelapse” or “pseudo-exacerbation.” These phenomena should always be considered before diagnosing a true MS attack. Some of the most common and important non-MS causes of increased symptoms and signs are noted in Table 7.1.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

      "title": "Etiology of Depression in Children.",
      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is experienced by a significant proportion of youth today, occurring at an earlier age than found in previous generations. Major Depressive Disorder can produce long-lasting detrimental effects on a child's life, which raises the question of etiology. Three areas were examined for evidence identifying specific determinants of Major Depressive Disorder in youth: biological factors, including studies on inherited characteristics; psychological factors, focusing on cognitive and affective activity; and environmental factors, such as stressful life events. The implications of the findings were then explored. ********** The term depression is often used to describe the temporary sadness, loneliness or blues that almost everyone feels from time to time. However, the DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revised) defines Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a mental illness in which a person consistently experiences deep, unshakable sadness and diminished interest in all activities for a period of at least 2 weeks. Major Depressive Disorder dramatically impairs an individual's ability to function in one or more areas of his or her life. Persons with MDD usually experience feelings of despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and sometimes thoughts of committing suicide. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses. Although depression has long been a diagnosis made for adults, it has become increasingly prevalent in the youth of today. Mental health practitioners are seeing a marked increase in the number of youth who are experiencing depression at an earlier age than did previous generations (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Depressive symptoms and disorder are found in a significant proportion of young people, with long-lasting detrimental effects (Rice, Harold and Thapar, January, 2002). Major Depressive Disorder, having such a definitive impact on a child's life, raises the question of etiology. Three major areas will be explored as to the cause of depression in children, including biological factors, psychological factors and environmental factors. Some depressions seem to occur suddenly, even when life appears to be going very well. Others have an obvious external cause such as a relationship conflict, financial difficulty or some personal failure. Yet many individuals experiencing these problems do not become depressed. In an attempt to identify causal factors, it has been hypothesized that depression results from the interaction between a person's biological and psychological vulnerabilities and a stressful life event (Cicchetti and Toth, 1998). Biological Factors Depression has been found to run in families (Rice, Harold, Thapar, November, 2002). By studying twins, researchers have found evidence of a strong genetic influence in depression. Genetically identical twins raised in the same environment are three times more likely to both have major depressive disorder than are fraternal twins, who have only about half their genes in common. In addition, identical twins are five times more likely to have bipolar disorder in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating manic and depressive mood swings. These findings suggest that vulnerability to depression can be inherited. Adoption studies have found that children of depression are vulnerable to depression even when raised by adoptive parents, offering more evidence of a genetic role in depression. A consensus that Major Depressive Disorder is both familial and inheritable is evident in the findings from both twin and family studies (Rice et al., January 2002). Family studies of early onset Major Depressive Disorder can be differentiated by the research methodology utilized (Scourfield, Rice, Thapar, Harold, Martin and McGuffin, 2003). Bottom-up studies evaluate the inheritability of Major Depressive Disorder by examining the child and working back through the child's ancestry. …",

Several studies have identified abnormal serotonergic parameters during the entire menstrual cycle and the luteal phase in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.‘ s p t t h t D h a r T t s c Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a combination of emotional, behavioral and physical symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, abate shortly after the onset of menses, and cause impairment in social and role functioning [1]. The hallmark emotional symptoms of PMDD include irritability, anxiety or tension, mood swings and depressed mood. PMDD occurs in approximately 5% of menstruating women and is considered the severe end of the spectrum of clinically significant premenstrual symptoms. Reduced quality of life (QoL), increased healthcare costs and reduced productivity at work have been documented in women with PMDD [2,3]. Recent reviews and expert guidelines summarize the diagnostic criteria, recommended forms for the prospective daily charting of symptoms and the importance of identifying a premenstrual exacerbation of an underlying mood or medical illness prior to the initiation of treatment [4–7]. The etiology of PMDD is likely to be multifactorial, and many possible etiological factors have been reviewed [8]. It is assumed that ovulation-related mechanisms trigger premenstrual symptoms in women with a vulnerability to CNS dysregulation [9].

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome and Anxiety Disorders: A Psychobiological Link",
      "abstract": "The term premenstrual syndrome (PMS) has been used for many years to describe disturbances of mood or physical symptoms occurring regularly 7–10 days before menses and remitting during menses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R) included PMS among the ‘proposed Diagnostic Categories Needing Further Study’ under the name of Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), and established among its diagnostic criteria the need for daily prospective symptoms self-ratings during at least two cycles, for confirmation [1]. The more recent fourth edition of DSM maintained PMS among the categories needing further study, adding the new category of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) [2]. PMDD is distinguished from PMS in several respects: It requires at least one mood symptom; the symptoms must be severe enough to cause functional impairment, and they must not be a mere exacerbation of another psychiatric disorder. Since no other diagnostic criteria have been proposed, many studies have compared the scores from the premenstrual and follicular phases: a 30–50% increase found in prospectively administered diaries is now normally accepted as an indicator of the diagnosis of PMS [3], no attention being paid to the quality of symptoms. On the other hand, no specific hormone changes or other biological markers are able to distinguish between PMS sufferers and normal women [4]. Therefore, the absence of both a universally accepted definition and an objective biological or clinical marker makes it impossible to study the etiology of PMS. Accordingly, the therapeutic approach is presently indefinite. Steinberg [5] correctly stated that the time-honored medical adage maintaining that ‘in the absence of cure, treatments multiply’ seems to be appropriate to PMS. Nevertheless, it is well accepted that the severe form of PMS, i.e. the one characterized by psychosocial impairment and thus requiring medical treatment, is present in 5–8% of women during their 40s. This implies that we should multiply our efforts toward the understanding of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

If the child responds “yes” to Question 1a and “no” to Question 1b (child reports depression but denies current episode), the interviewer should assess suicide risk (Questions 12a–12d) and then skip to the section on Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia). If the child responds “yes” to any part of Question 12, the interviewer should obtain further details and assess the child’s current risk of harm to self or others. It is important to inquire about the specifics of plan, time of occurrence, frequency of such thoughts, details of the attempt, current absence or presence of ideation, and so on, and take appropriate preventive action. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder requires five “yes” responses to Questions 4–12. At least one symptom must be depressed or irritable mood or loss of interest in usual activities. Also, the symptoms must occur together nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, and interference in functioning must be evident.",

      "title": "Influence of Sex Hormones in a Mouse Model of Multi Etiology Dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Up to 80% of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients suffer from concurrent vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) resulting in multi‐etiology dementia. VCID (the 2nd leading cause of dementia) is more common in men throughout most of the lifespan. while the majority (approximately 2/3) of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients are women. Ageing is a main dementia risk factor which may act through the depletion of sex hormones. Both testosterone, in men, and estrogen, in women, have been shown to be neuroprotective. In this study we examine the effect of gonadal hormones on cognitive changes in a mouse model of multi etiology dementia using the App NL‐F/NL‐F knock‐in Alzheimer’s disease mouse model that does not overexpress amyloid precursor protein. Methods 5‐6 months old App NL‐F/NL‐F mice were subjected to gonadectomy or sham surgery and left to recover for 3 weeks to clear any endogenous gonadal hormones. Multi‐etiology dementia was modeled using chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (unilateral carotid artery occlusion). Control animals ( App NL‐F/NL‐F without hypoperfusion; AD only model) received a sham surgery. Mice were then subjected to a battery of behavioral tests before being euthanized and then brains and serum were collected. Results Cognitive impairment differences between groups were investigated using several behavioral tests: anxiety‐like behavior and activity levels using an open field testing, episodic‐like memory using a novel object recognition test, spatial learning and memory via Barnes maze testing and activities of daily living using a nest building test. Our next step is to evaluate the underlying pathology in the brain that could mediate cognitive deficits (i.e. amyloid pathology, white matter damage and neuroinflammation). Conclusions We hope that this work will highlight the importance of modeling endocrine aging in animal models of dementia and will contribute to further understanding of sex differences and sex specific risk factors for dementia.",

Generally no major focal neurological abnormalities were observed but most of the patients exhibited minor signs. The severity of developmental disabilities in our patients varied between and within families and between genders. All adult males had macroorchidism. Unusual facial features were present in 13 males but none were seen in the females. Familial occurrences were found in 18 cases (64%); 10 cases (36%) were sporadic. Overall, males were more severely affected than females.

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

While presentation of late-onset, post-service difficulties may explain some of the difference between veterans and those in service, delayed-onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be partly explained by prior subthreshold PTSD, as well as other mental health difficulties. In the longer term, veterans do not appear to suffer worse mental health than equivalent civilians. This overall lack of difference, despite increased mental health difficulties in those who have recently left, suggests that veterans are not at risk of worse mental health and/or that poor mental health is a cause, rather than a consequence, of leaving service.",

      "title": "Erectile Dysfunction Associated with Psychoactive Substances",
      "abstract": "Psychoactive substances are believed to be aphrodisiac; but in reality they have deleterious effects on all the aspects of sexual function. The purpose of this article is to review and summarize the available scientific literature on the impact of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs on erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. Almost all of them have been reported to be associated with ED. These substances may exert their inhibitory effect on erection through their effects on central neurotransmitter pathways (serotogenic, adrenergic or dopaminergic). Besides, some also may exhibit vasoconstricting properties (cocaine), impair endothelium function (nicotine) or suppress the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary, resulting in hypogonadism (morphine) to induce ED. The relationship between ED and psychoactive substances is attributed not only to pharmacological effects, but also to psychological and social reactions to substance dependence. Whether withdrawal from the substances could restore erectile function remains unknown. However, human and animal studies demonstrated that the effects of neurological damage from chronic substance abuse are long-lasting. This information of sexual consequence of the substances will be of great general interest and may serve as a powerful tool to healthcare providers.",

Diagnostic criteria require: I. Progressive motor weakness of more than one limb, and II) absent muscle stretch reflexes. Features that strongly support the diagnosis are: 1. Cease of progression of weakness by 4 weeks, relative symmetrical involvement of the limbs, presence of mild sensory symptoms or signs, involvement of cranial nerves VII (50%) more than IX, X, III, IV and VI, recovery within 2 to 3 weeks after progression stop, presence of autonomic dysfunction, and absent of fever at onset; 2.

In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur.

      "abstract": "A somatic symptom disorder (SSD) diagnosis is made when a person places emphasis on physical symptoms such as pain, exhaustion, or shortness of breath so much that it causes significant suffering and/or functional issues. The individual's thoughts, sentiments, and activities are an overstated reaction to such symptoms. Regardless of whether the physical symptoms are connected to a diagnosable medical condition, the person experiences symptoms and believes they are ill. When a person exhibits symptoms that satisfy the diagnostic standards of an SSD, the disease should be identified. However, due to the disorder's frequent co-occurrence, particularly with anxiety and depressive disorders, support for these concurrent diagnoses should be sought. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, and medication are all examples of effective treatments for SSD. It has been demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) aid in treating symptoms. The authors describe the case of an eight-year-old boy with complaints of abdominal pain that were unexplained by various tests. The pain lasted 10 years and was episodic (each episode lasted around 10 days; one particular episode lasted approximately six months). Multiple investigations were conducted, but no physiological reason for his symptoms was discovered. His evaluation was conducted by an interdisciplinary team that included neurologists, psychiatrists, surgeons, and doctors. The underlying cause was subsequently determined to be SSD. As people with SSD present to general practitioners and the emergency room rather than psychiatric facilities, this incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need to advocate for an accurate diagnosis of this condition.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionAlcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

In women, the cycle of sexual response begins in the brain, where a memory, an image, a scent, music, or a fantasy acts as a trigger to prompt sexual arousal. Thus, the brain is really the key and starting place for treatment of sexual dysfunction. Decreased libido, altered arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, and dyspareunia are the four broad types of sexual dysfunction in women. Decreased libido, thought to be related to androgenic hormones, results in delayed or altered arousal, decreased vaginal lubrication and dilation, delayed or absent orgasm, and pain or dyspareunia, which can lead to an aversion to sexual experiences.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within rapid-eye-movement (REM) or non-REM (NREM) sleep, or during arousals from sleep. Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, perceptions, dreaming, and autonomic nervous system functioning. Also, instinctual behaviors can be involuntarily and pathologically released with the parasomnias, including sexual behaviors (sexsomnia), aggression, locomotion, and eating. The clinical consequences of a parasomnia can affect the patient, the bed partner, and any nearby individual. Sexsomnia is classified as a variant of confusional arousals (and sleepwalking), an NREM parasomnia, with amnesia for the sexual behaviors virtually always reported. The cumulative world published literature on sexsomnia consists of 220 cases, 84% males and predominant age in the 30s and 40s. Most cases were identified as NREM parasomnias, although obstructive sleep apnea was the identified trigger in 10.4% of cases. Various other triggers were identified. Forensic consequences were reported in 15 of the reported clinical cases. Sleep medicine physicians can expect inquiries from attorneys to solicit their involvement in criminal trials as forensic implications of parasomnias become increasingly more apparent. As courts generally have an implicit bias that is not favorable to the “sleepwalking defense,” sleep medicine physicians who take on the mantle of an expert medical witness should define their role and understand that supporting justice in the courtroom can only be optimally done through a strong collaborative effort with the attorney throughout the legal process.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric polypharmacy is defined as the use of two or more drugs in the treatment of a psychiatric condition. It is widely prevalent in clinical practice. The rationale for polypharmacy is not clear. Etiologic factors are patient demographics (age, gender, race, low socioeconomic status), personality disorder, psychiatric conditions (psychosis, schizophrenia, affective or mood disorders), comorbidities, severity of disease, treatment- refractoriness, prescribing practice, inpatient or outpatient setting, concern for reduction of extra-pyramidal and other sideeffects. Among children and adolescents' the polypharmacy correlates are age (13 -15 years), male gender, caucasian race, low socio-economic status, medicaid or public insurance, disability, and foster care or child custody outside of biological family. Pediatric polypharmacy is also associated with a diagnosis of behavioral disorder, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, conduct disorder/ oppositional defiant disorder, personality disorder, violence, tics, psychosis, affective and mood disorder.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Fatigue Among Female Academicians",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "title": "Pharmacological treatment of poststroke pathological laughing and crying",
      "abstract": "A 60-year-old man with left-sided limb weakness after a stroke was referred for assessment and treatment of depression. The patient reported that, after his stroke 2 weeks ago, he has been crying “for no reason” several times a day. He described that the crying spells last several seconds and cannot be resisted. The patient denies depressed mood or symptoms consistent with a mood disorder. On examination, stereotyped paroxysms of crying lasting 5–10 seconds were noted during the interview, incongruent to any emotional themes discussed. The patient was diagnosed with pathological crying and was started on citalopram 10 mg orally at night. On follow-up, he reported that his crying spells stopped within days of initiating the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication.\r\n\r\nPathological laughing and crying (PLC) is one of the most common poststroke affective disorders. The cardinal feature of this disorder is a markedly lowered threshold for exhibiting affective behaviour (crying, laughing or both) that is out of proportion to underlying feelings of happiness or sadness. At an extreme, the expression of affect is completely incongruous to the reported underlying emotional experience. Pure pathological crying is by far the most common presentation, representing approximately 80% of cases of post-stroke PLC. Estimates of the prevalence of PLC vary from 7% to up to 48.5% of stroke survivors, with a greater prevalence found in inpatient populations and during the acute post-stroke period.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to consider the presence of a depressive episode in people who present with excessive emotionality, most people with PLC do not have a diagnosable mood disorder, and many do not manifest depressive symptoms at all.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of PLC is unknown. Converging lines of evidence suggest that monoaminergic neurotransmission is altered in those who develop PLC after a stroke.\r\n\r\nFour double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trials of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of PLC have been reported in the English literature. In pooled data of 93 people from these placebo-controlled trials of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram, 96% of patients who received antidepressant medication demonstrated a greater than 50% reduction in the number of crying episodes at the end of the treatment trials, compared with 27.5% of patients who received placebo, yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. Antidepressants have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes after a stroke, often within days, rather than the weeks typically expected before antidepressant effects are seen. SSRIs should be regarded as the first-line choice when treating poststroke PLC, given the greater tolerability of SSRIs and their lower propensity to have effects on the cardiovascular system, compared with tricyclic antidepressant drugs. The doses of the SSRI medications that were effective in treating PLC in the studies described above (fluoxetine 20 mg, sertraline 50 mg and citalopram 10–20 mg) are at the low end of the therapeutic range used for treating depression. Case reports suggest that bupropion, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and lamotrigine may be effective for PLC in people who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, SSRIs.\r\n\r\nThere are limited data to guide clinicians on how long patients should remain on treatment. For most stroke patients, the natural history of PLC is for the symptoms to gradually improve over time. However, it is estimated that 10%–15% of people continue to manifest symptoms a year after a stroke. Reports have suggested that PLC can reemerge after discontinuing the antidepressant drug, whereas reinstatement of the medication leads to swift amelioration of these symptoms. The need for long-term treatment needs to be evaluated on an individual basis.\r\n\r\nPeter Giacobbe, MD Alastair Flint, MB Department of Psychiatry University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry University Health Network Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Toronto, Ont.",

The integration of these different afferences contributes to the proper attitude of the body in static and dynamic conditions. Equilibrium disorders are common among elderly patients and are responsible for falls and fractures, leading sometimes to catastrophic outcomes, representing a serious health and social problem. Approximately one third of elderly patients at home and about 50% of institutionalized, over 75 year-old, suffer from this particular condition, with at least one fall a year and almost 50% of these with recurrent episodes. Females are more affected than males. Attempts to ascertain the underlying cause of unbalance should be done, leading then to specific treatment. Nevertheless, many elderly patients do not have a single disease but rather a multitude of medical conditions which may cause dizziness, imbalance and vertigo: effects of ageing, drugs, cardiovascular and neurological disorders, ocular and orthopaedic diseases. A literature review was carried out with the intention to offer practical and useful notions for the management and treatment of equilibrium disorders. In clinical practice, the main challenge is to distinguish between peripheral and central imbalance disorders. The data collected from history and clinical exams should be integrated with the intent to include the patient in one of the following clinical conditions: vertiginous syndrome, pre-syncope and/or syncope, neurological diseases, other conditions. Following the differential diagnosis, treatment mainly consists in drug administration (antiemetic and vestibular suppressor drugs) and vestibular rehabilitation (physiotherapy and vestibular exercises).",

      "title": "Effect of pharmacotherapy on suicidal ideation and behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract Suicide has become an important public health issue. It is the eighth leading cause of death among adults and varies between the second and third leading cause of death for youth under the age of 24 years. Suicidal ideation is a common symptom of psychiatric disorders; over 55% of individuals with mental disorders report suicidal ideation at some point in their lives. Fully 25% of individuals with mental disorders make at least one lifetime suicide attempt and over 12% make multiple suicide attempts. Suicidal ideation and suicidal acts are most prevalent in individuals with mood disorders. Almost 17% of individuals with either major depression or dysthymia make at least one suicide attempt while over 28% of individuals with bipolar disorders attempt suicide. Intensification of suicidal thoughts and behavior can occur in depressed patients undergoing active treatment, including antidepressant pharmacotherapy, and the risk may persist until remission occurs. Within this context, it is likely that reports linking the SSRI fluoxetine (and other antidepressants) with intensification of suicidal ideation represent random occurrences rather than causation. Although it is possible that some type of aberration in CNS serotonergic function in rare individuals might be associated with an idiosyncratic response to serotonin‐specific medications, the retrospective meta‐analyses of a number of databases indicate there is no causal relationship between SSRI or other antidepressant medication treatment and the emergence of suicidal ideation or behavior. Rather, the available data support the conclusion that antidepressant pharmacotherapy diminishes suicidal ideation and acts. Depression 2:169–172 (1994/1995). © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

There have been many attempts to explain the reasons behind these medical phenomena, but single cases have been generally reported, making it extremely difficult to draw valid conclusions. It is acknowledged that there are psychotic and non‑psychotic causes, from psychiatric problems and sexual identity disorders to cultural or religious reasons, alcohol or recreational drug consumption, unconventional types of sexual satisfaction or self‑satisfaction. Recent theories consider self‑mutilation as a phenomenon of reducing distress or tension, as an expression of feelings of anger or sorrow. It is believed that 55‑85% of those who have resorted to self‑mutilation have at least once in their life tried to commit suicide. There is evidence that early discovery and intervention as well as proper treatment in regards to psychosis can significantly reduce the number of self‑mutilation episodes, with a protective role of these individuals. Cases of genital self‑mutilation may be considered real medical emergencies, sometimes extremely challenging and accompanied by severe complications. Injury of the genital area is usually accompanied by numerous early or long‑term complications due to the marked vascular area and to the microbial flora present in this part of the body. The degree of mutilation is an unforeseen aspect that the medical staff may have to encounter during the intervention, sometimes testing their imagination and surgical skills when dealing with such a case. Understanding the causes of these self‑aggressive behaviors, which may be life‑threatening, is critical and multidisciplinary mobilization is needed after treatment of the acute phases. The outcome of these patients depends on integrated collaborative work. These cases represent a serious reason for frustration for the physicians involved in solving them, and knowledge of these issues is valuable to urologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals.",

      "abstract": "Factitious disorders are defined as acts of self-harm that directly or indirectly result in clinically-relevant injury. They are typically performed in secret and without direct intention of suicide (1, 2). The patient’s initial goal is hospital admission and receiving medical treatment to confirm the severity of their state (3). Current prevalence ranges of factitious disorders is between 0.05 and 2.0%, with women being 4–20-fold more likely to be affected than men (1, 4–8). Contemporary psychodermatology classifies these disorders as: 1) dermatoses of primary psychiatric genesis (emotional/psychiatric disorders); 2) dermatoses with a multifactiorial basis, of which the course is subject to psychiatric influences (psychosomatic disease); or 3) secondary psychiatric disorders due to serious or disfiguring dermatoses (somatopsychic disease) (9). Mood swings, anxiety, impulsive behavior and somatization disorders are common among patients with dermatitis artefacta (5, 10–12).",

      "abstract": "To make a diagnosis of concussion, you need a reliable history of 2 things: (1) An acute external physical force applied to the brain AND (2) An impairment in the function of the brain directly caused by the external physical force. One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "abstract": "Little is known of the nature and origins of the attitudes that older people have towards ageing, disease, and medical treatments. Several studies on older people in the community have suggested under-reporting of symptoms. There may be several reasons for this, including the possibility that some older people regard disease processes as a natural feature of ageing and, consequently, feel that medical intervention may have little to offer.To investigate the perceptions of older people about the significance of symptoms and what action they would take in response to particular symptoms.Thirty-three men and 77 women attending social clubs (median age 78 years) were opportunistically selected and assessed using a supervised questionnaire.Many symptoms classically associated with common diseases were often considered to represent disease as well as to be normal for old people. Most would consult a doctor if they were to experience them. Some important symptoms, such as blackouts or paralysis of a limb, were not considered to be normal. Non-specific symptoms of psychiatric disturbances were also frequently considered normal but were not considered to represent disease. Whether or not a doctor would be consulted was often, but not always, related to whether a symptom was thought to represent a disease. Consulting a pharmacist was seldom considered appropriate.Doctors working with elderly people need to consider how beliefs about health and disease might affect what is reported to them. Specific enquiry needs to be made about symptoms of psychiatric disturbances. These findings suggest that there is a case for increased health education at retirement age.",

      "title": "Is Favorable Outcome Possible After Prolonged Refractory Status Epilepticus?",
      "abstract": "Summary: When status epilepticus (SE) remains refractory to appropriate therapy, it is associated with high mortality and with substantial morbidity in survivors. Many outcome predictors such as age, seizure type, level of consciousness before treatment, and mostly, etiology, are well-established. A longer duration of SE is often associated with worse outcome, but duration may lose its prognostic value after several hours. Several terms and definitions have been used to describe prolonged, refractory SE, including “malignant SE,” “prolonged” SE, and more recently, “super refractory” SE, defined as “SE that has continued or recurred despite 24 hours of general anesthesia (or coma-inducing anticonvulsants).” There are few data available regarding the outcome of prolonged refractory SE, and even fewer for SE remaining refractory to anesthetic drugs. This article reviews reports of outcome after prolonged, refractory, and “super refractory” SE. Most information detailing the clinical outcome of patients surviving these severe illnesses, in which seizures can persist for days or weeks (and especially those concerning “super-refractory” SE) come from case reports and retrospective cohort studies. In many series, prolonged, refractory SE has a mortality of 30% to 50%, and several studies indicate that most survivors have a substantial decline in functional status. Nevertheless, several reports demonstrate that good functional outcome is possible even after several days of SE and coma induction. Treatment of refractory SE should not be withdrawn from younger patients without structural brain damage at presentation solely because of the duration of SE.",

      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

      "abstract": "La epilepsia es una enfermedad cerebral definida por una de las siguientes condiciones: - al menos 2 crisis no provocadas que ocurran con una separacion de al menos 24 horas - una crisis no provocada con la probabilidad de tener mas crisis en los proximos 10 anos similar al riesgo general de recurrencia (al menos 60%) de dos crisis epilepticas no provocadas, - diagnostico de sindrome epileptico (grupo de entidades que se identifican con seguridad por un conjunto de caracteristicas electroclinicas).\nEn Espana segun el estudio EPIBERIA se calcula que la epilepsia tiene una prevalencia de un 0,6%, lo que supone que en nuestro pais hay cerca de 280.000 pacientes que padecen esta enfermedad. Actualmente se han disenado farmacos antiepilepticos con los que se consigue un control de crisis en la mayoria de los casos. Pero queda un 25-30% restante en el que el tratamiento no es efectivo y el paciente sigue presentando crisis, lo que se denomina: epilepsia farmacorresistente. Para este tipo de epilepsia tambien hay tratamientos: el uso combinado de farmacos, la cirugia, la colocacion de estimuladores o la utilizacion de la dieta cetogenica. A pesar de estos ultimos tratamientos comentados (los cuales no estan indicado para todos los pacientes), seguimos teniendo un grupo de pacientes que sigue presentando crisis, con la perdida de calidad de vida y aumento de mortalidad que esto conlleva.\nEs en la busqueda, por mejorar el control de las crisis y la calidad de vida de estos pacientes, donde surge la hipotesis de este trabajo: el uso de probioticos en la epilepsia farmacorresistente.\nEsta idea surgio, en base a estudios actuales, que ponen en relacion la interaccion entre la microbiota y el sistema nervioso central, lo que se denomina como: eje microbiota-intestino-cerebro o en ingles brain En los ultimos anos cada vez hay mas articulos que relacionan ambos organos y que se han propuesto como etiopatogenia de diferentes enfermedades neurologicas como pueden ser el Parkinson, el Alzheimer, la migrana, la Esclerosis Multiple, e incluso ya hay un estudio de hace unos meses que lo relaciona con epilepsia. \nNuestra hipotesis fue, que modificando la microbiota, gracias a la administracion de probioticos, podriamos mejorar el manejo de las crisis en pacientes epilepticos farmacorresistentes. Esta hipotesis la basamos en 4 supuestos: 1.- La generacion de neurotransmisores inhibidores por parte de la microbiota intestinal, como puede ser el GABA, que favorecen la inhibicion de crisis.\n2.- El poder antiinflamatorio de los probioticos, que estaria actuando sobre uno de los mecanismos etiopatogenicos de la epilepsia, la inflamacion.\n3.- La posible modificacion de la microbiota y su posible implicacion en la epilepsia 4.- La accion de la microbiota sobre el metabolismo de los farmacos. \nEl estudio fue aprobado por el comite de etica de nuestro Hospital. \nSe realizo un estudio cuasi-experimental donde cada paciente fue su propio control (para evitar el sesgo de la diferencia del numero de crisis; pero con la limitacion de que no tiene comparador contra placebo).\nEn el estudio participaron 45 pacientes que acudieron un total de 4 veces. La visita inicial fue para proponer el estudio, validar criterios de inclusion y exclusion y firma del consentimiento informado; ese dia se inicio un registro de recogida basal de crisis de 3 meses. La visita 2 es el momento de inicio de los probioticos que tomaron durante 4 meses. En la visita 3 se comprueba la efectividad de los probioticos (con el control de reduccion de crisis gracias al registro de las mismas) y se realiza una visita mas, 4 meses despues para comprobar si la efectividad persiste a pesar de la suspension del tratamiento. En cada visita se realizo una toma de constantes, peso y analitica de sangre, orina y heces y un registro de control de crisis, adhesion al tratamiento y calidad de vida.\nLos resultados de nuestro estudio son positivos, de tal manera que hemos encontrado una reduccion de crisis de mas del 50% (reduccion minima establecida para poder considerarse efectiva en los ensayos clinicos sobre epilepsia) en el 28,9% de los pacientes.\nSe ha obtenido una mejora en la calidad de vida (clinica y estadisticamente significativa) y una comprobacion de la seguridad de los probioticos en nuestro estudio.\nRESUMEN BIBLIOGRAFIA:\n1.- Serrano-Castro PJ, Mauri-Llerda JA, Hernandez-Ramos Fj, Sanchez Alvzrez JC et al.

Although some contradictory results exist, the majority of studies demonstrate that depressed patients experience more stressful events in the months that precede the onset of their disorder than do normal controls or schizophrenics. In calculating relative risk figures, it seems that depressive risk is increased by a factor of about 5 or 6 for the six months after an event. Certain events, such as undesirable, loss, or severely threatening events, are particularly likely to precede a depression. These results suggest that stressful events can bring about depressive episodes, but most of the evidence that supports this conclusion emanates from retrospective studies, and corroborating prospective studies are definitely needed. Furthermore, not all depressives report precipitating events, so other causal factors are also operative.",

Cases of anorexia in males are characterized by a higher predominance of hereditary loading, by an earlier onset (10--14 in comparison to 15--20 of female anorexia), a rather early appearance of refined deficitary symptomatology, and frequently enough a rapid psychopathization. However, these patients preserve formal abilities for a rather long period. The disease, as a rule, is an expression of a schizophrenic process unlike female anorexia, where this form of pathology may be inherent not only to schizophrenia but also to neuroses, psychopathy or be an independent psychosomatic disorder.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Antidepressant treatment, although it is effective to improve the manifestations of major depression, may also induce or exacerbate some symptoms of sexual dysfunction. Symptoms such as decreased libido, anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erection difficulty or dyspareunia, affect the quality of life of the subject who suffers and the self-esteem, can lead to lack of adherence to treatment and in accordingly, the relapse of depressive symptoms. Serotonergic antidepressants are frequently associated with the onset of sexual dysfunction in sexually active patients exceeding 70%. Clinicians underestimate the actual incidence of dysfunction as the technical specifications of drugs show lower levels than 25% and spontaneous reports of patients do not exceed 20-40%. Aims Vortioxetina is a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and is also an agonist of the 5-HT1A partial agonist 5-HT1B and an antagonist of 5-HT3, 5-HT1D and 5-HT7. Apparently, this molecule at doses of between 5 and 15 mg is safe and effective and does not cause sexual dysfunction. It is a well-tolerated and safe, with low incidence of sexual dysfunction. Methods To evaluate the action we have evaluated sexual dysfunction in patients with major depression before receiving treatment vortioxetina (whether state or not previously treated with other antidepressants) and at 2, 6 and 12 months after starting treatment with the drug. So we’ve used the SALSex scale (Scale for measuring sexual dysfunction secondary to psychotropic drugs). Results The results of this study are still being analyzed.

      "title": "Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Women: Physiology, Assessment, Diagnosis, and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Nearly half of women in the United States report problems with sexual function. Many health care providers do not ask about sexual concerns during routine clinical encounters because of personal discomfort, lack of familiarity with treatment, or the belief that they lack adequate time to address this complex issue. This may be especially true for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), the most commonly identified sexual problem among women. HSDD is characterized by a deficiency of sexual thoughts, feelings, or receptiveness to sexual stimulation that has been present for at least 6 months, causes personal distress, and is not due to another medical condition. This is an up‐to‐date overview of HSDD for clinicians, discussing its physiology, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. Although a definitive physiology of HSDD is still unknown, multiple hormones and neurotransmitters likely participate in a dual‐control model to balance excitation and inhibition of sexual desire. For assessment and diagnosis, validated screening tools are discussed, and the importance of a biopsychosocial assessment is emphasized, with guidance on how this can be implemented in clinical encounters. The 2 recently approved medications for HSDD, flibanserin and bremelanotide, are reviewed as well as off‐label treatments. Overall, HSDD represents a common yet likely underrecognized disorder that midwives and other health care providers who care for women across the life span are in a unique position to address.",

This paroxysmal EEG activity was consistently accentuated unilaterally over the superior frontal regions. The first patient showed ictal aphasia and occasional right hemiparesis during these episodes, and partial left frontal lobectomy resulted in temporary freedom from seizures. The classification of these ictal episodes is difficult. They apparently fall into the category of absence status (petit mal status), but the focal neurological signs do not fit the presently valid definitions of absence status, nor does the lack of symmetrical bilateral-synchronous paroxysmal discharges. Perhaps a special category of status epilepticus should be established.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and Risk of Dementia: A Literature Review.",
      "abstract": "Introduction Dementia is a clinical syndrome affecting 1-2% of the population under the age of 65, while at older ages the frequency doubles every five years. The clinical manifestations include memory loss, communication deficits, agnosia, apraxia and executive dysfunction.Schizophrenia is a complex, chronic mental disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population, presenting with disturbances in perception, thought and behavior. Objectives To investigate the relationship between schizophrenia and later-onset dementia; more specifically to explore whether schizophrenia increases the dementia risk. Methods A review of 35 articles -from 2010 to 2023- on PubMed and Google Scholar regarding patients with schizophrenia or other type of psychosis, who later presented dementia. Results Patients with a history of schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder, or delusional disorder are more likely to develop dementia.The greatest risk is presented in patients showing the shortest duration of psychotic symptoms (5 years or less), while at 5-10 years the probability of developing dementia decreases.The most common types of dementia occurring in psychotic patients are alzheimer’s disease (50-70%),vascular dementia (30%) and unspecified dementia (15%).Chronic patients (10+ years of symptomatology) are less likely to develop dementia. Psychotic patients over the age of 65 are more likely to develop dementia later in life, while individuals who develop schizophrenia after their 40s are three to four times more likely to present dementia compared to patients carrying a schizophrenia diagnosis before their 40s.Females with Late-Onset Schizophrenia have an increased dementia risk compared to males carrying the same diagnosis and compared to healthy females of the same age. Physical conditions implicated in the onset of dementia in schizophrenic patients include cardiovascular diseases, lung disease, substance and alcohol use, head injuries and diabetes. Conclusions According to data, there is a strong correlation between schizophrenia and dementia.However, the related studies are limited in number, while their results require further investigation because of limitations (small sample sizes, co-morbidities, selection of chronic elderly patients).Furthermore, most of these studies were conducted in Western countries, highlighting the necessity of pursuing additional research.

      "title": "Acute psychosis as the presenting manifestation of lupus: case reports",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organs with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Neuropsychiatric manifestation (NPSLE) is present among 28–40% of the SLE patients. Psychosis is rarely the only initial symptom of lupus, as neuropsychiatric lupus is often associated with systemic activity. We present two cases of young ladies presenting with acute psychosis as the predominant symptom and further diagnosed with SLE disease. Case reports: Case 1 A 20-year-old female, unmarried, presented to the Psychology Department with acute behavioral abnormality associated with staring, insomnia and, aggressive behavior, hearing voices for the last 3 days. No other psychiatric or neurological symptoms; she was taking 20 mg oral prednisolone prescribed according to a history of fatigue, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, pain in almost all joints, and myalgia for the last 1 month. There was no sign of focal neurological deficit or meningeal irritation. Examination of other systems did not find any clinical abnormality except for the presence of photosensitivity. A psychiatric consultation was ordered. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 3200 cell/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 9.2 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), C-reactive protein (CRP) 65 mg/l ( n ≤6), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 100 mm/h(range=0–20). anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) profile which was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with anti-ds-DNA positive (+), decreased C3 and C4. The diagnosis of SLE was done according to the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria (EULAR/ACR Criteria). Case2 A 37-year-old married female with 3 children presented to the Psychology Department with disorientation, staring, hearing voices, seeing images of people who want to hurt her, refusing to respond to people, and insomnia for the last 10 days. She had complained of fatigue and low-grade fever for last month. A psychiatric consultation was ordered, and the patient was managed with an injection of haloperidol 5 mg BD. Laboratory tests: white blood cells 7300 cells/mm 3 (range=4000–11 000) with normal differentiation, hemoglobin 8.7 mg/dl (range=12.5–16), platelet 90 000/dl (range=150 000–400 000), reticulocyte:1.4, CRP 7 mg/l ( n ≤6), and ESR 50mm/h (range=0–20). The ANA profile was positive in 1:320 dilution, homogenous type, along with the anti-ds-DNA negative (−), decreased C3, and normal C4. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a high white matter signal around the lateral ventricles and in the semi-oval centers. Mild dilation of the lateral ventricles and slight elevation of the left insular and medial temporal lobe signal. Conclusion: Our case reports showed that organic disorders should be considered while evaluating acute psychosis, especially autoimmune disorders. The presence of laboratory features like anemia, elevated ESR, and elevated CRP should be taken with utmost importance.",

      "abstract": "The concept of prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia is an old matter of debate. There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Aims Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as a noncyclical pain that has duration of at least 6 months and can lead to decreased quality of life and physical performance. The pain can be attributed to problems in the pelvic organs and/or problems in related systems, and possible psycho‐social attributes may contribute to the manifestation. Due to the complex nature, CPP syndromes are multifactorial and the terminology needs to reflect the setting. Methods The current review is a synthesis of key aspects of the recent International Continence Society Standardization for Terminology in CPP Syndromes. Results Nine domains can be used for a detailed description of CPP. They include four domains specific to the pelvic organs (lower urinary tract, female genital, male genital, gastrointestinal), two related to other sources of pain which may be perceived in the pelvis (musculoskeletal, neurological) and three which may influence the response to the pain or its impact on the individual (psychological, sexual, and comorbidities). For an individual patient with CPP, each domain should be reviewed in terms of symptoms and signs, noting that positive findings could reflect either a primary cause or a secondary consequence. The findings will guide further evaluations and subsequent treatment. Conclusion We present a synthesis of the standard for terminology in CPP syndromes in women and men, which serves as a systematic framework to consider possible sources of pain (pelvic organs or other sources) and the individual responses and impact.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "title": "Four‐repeat tauopathies and late‐onset psychiatric disorders: Etiological relevance or incidental findings?",
      "abstract": "Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration are four-repeat (4R) tauopathies that develop in the presenium or later. Whether these diseases are associated with the occurrence of late-onset psychiatric disorders remains unclear. To facilitate the accumulation of clinicopathological findings regarding this issue, we here present a selected series of 11 cases that clinically developed psychotic disorder (n = 7; age at onset: 41-75 years), depressive disorder (n = 1; 49 years), bipolar disorder (n = 2; 32 and 37 years) and somatoform disorder (n = 1; 88 years), and had at least one pathological hallmark of these tauopathies. The mean age at death was 74.3 years. No case showed dementia, at least in the early stage of the course. Nine cases had AGD. Granular fuzzy astrocytes in the amygdala were noted in all AGD cases and one non-AGD case. Two AGD cases had tufted astrocytes (TAs) in the amygdala but not in the frontal cortex and striatum. Three AGD and two non-AGD cases had TAs in the frontal cortex and/or striatum but not in the amygdala. One AGD case had a small number of astrocytic plaques in the frontal cortex, striatum and globus pallidus. Only one case was diagnosed as atypical PSP according to the NINDS-PSP neuropathological criteria. No case had high-level Alzheimer's disease pathology, Lewy body disease or limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy. Two cases had mild neuronal loss in the hippocampus and substantia nigra, respectively. Clinicopathological studies focusing especially on early changes of 4R tauopathies, as well as the development of surrogate markers of these diseases, may be necessary for better understanding of the pathogenic backgrounds of late-onset psychiatric disorders.",

In studies evaluating the possible role of depression in these associations, depression among sexually assaulted persons did not account for their poorer health. Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

To date, there is no consensus on the treatment for RGS.A 58-year-old woman presented with persistent and unwanted genital arousal in her clitoris and labia minora.

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the DSM-IV recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioral symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical and/or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric and/or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in close reciprocal relationship with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond the conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other nonantidepressant treatments, or the more extreme interventions that eliminate ovulation altogether, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option for this population. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that the SRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

      "title": "Could This be a New Syndrome? Report of Seven Cases with Characteristic Mental and Physical Degeneracy",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY In a period of 5 years, seven children have been seen who show a specific state of mental and physical degeneracy occurring sporadically in otherwise healthy families. The only possible predisposing factor was birth trauma, which was present in 5. Lethargy in early infancy is followed by more than a decade of great excitability and stubborn restlessness. There is delay in motor development and outstanding clumsiness of voluntary movements. The face is often broad and flat with straight eyebrows. More constant are a ‘gosling’ mouth, a short neck and occasional postural lordosis (‘marabou stance’). The associated eye defects include strabismus, sévère myopia and a tendency to retinal detachment. There are unusual dominance patterns. The IQ is between 50 and 75. Scholastic attainments are poor except for relatively good ability and interest in reading. The outstanding characteristics are typically emotionally conditioned hand movements (rubbing and wringing), a tubular quality of voice, an abnormal sleep rhythm and very late bladder control. This consistent combination of clinical features can hardly be regarded as coincidental. No reports of similar children have been found in the literature. RÉSUMÉ Un nouveau syndrome ? A propos de sept cas présentant une dégénérescence caractéristique mentale et physique Durant une période de 5 ans, sept enfants ont été suivis qui présentaient une dégénéres‐cence mentale et physique, survenant sporadiquement dans les families par ailleurs en bonne santé. Le seul facteur predisposant qui pourrait être retenu est un traumatisme à la naissance 5 fois présent. Un état léthargique dans la première enfance a été suivi durant plus de dix ans par une grande excitabilité et une instabilityé permanente. II y a eu un retard dans le développement moteur et une maladresse évidente des mouvements volontaires. La figure est souvent large et aplatie avec des sourcils rectilignes. Plus fréquemment reléves ont été une bouche en bee d'oison, un cou court et une lordose posturale occasionnelle (tenue de marabout). Les troubles oculaires associés comprennent le strabisme, une myopie sévère et une tendance au décollement rétinien. On observe des stéréotypes anormax. Le QI est compris entre 50 et 75. Les résultats scolaires sont pauvres excepte une aptitude relative‐ment bonne pour la lecture et un intérêt certain pour cette acquisition. Les caractéristiques les plus spécifiques sont des mouvements de mains déclenchés par l'émotion: mouvements de frottements et de torsions, le caractére caverneux de la voix, le rythme anormal du sommeil et un contrôle vésical très tardif. II est difficile de considérer comme accidentelle cette combinaison de manifestations cliniques particulières; il n'a pas été observé de cas semblables dans la littérature. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Handelt es sich um ein neues Syndrom ? Bericht über sieben Fälle mil charakteristischer geistiger und physicher Degeneration Über einen Zeitraum von 5 Jahren wurden sieben Kinder mit einem spezifischen Zustand geistiger und physischer Degeneration gesehen, der sporadisch in ansonsten gesunden Familien auftrat. Der einzige mögliche prädisponierende Faktor war ein Geburtstrauma bei fünf Kindern. Nach einem Stadium der Lethargie in der fruuhen Kindheit folgt ein Jahrzehnt großer Erregbarkeit und nicht zu beeinflussender Unruhe. Die motorische Entwicklung ist verspätet und es findet sich eine ungewöhnliche Ungeschichicklichkeit bei willkürlichen Bewegungen. Das Gesicht ist oft breit und flach mit geraden Augenbrauen. Noch haufiger findet sich ein ‘Schnabelmund’, ein kurzer Hals und gelegentlich eine posturale Lordose (‘Marabuhaltung’). Zu den damit verbundenen Augenkrankheiten gehSren Strabismus, schwere Myopie und eine Neigung zur Netzhautablösung. Es gibt ungewöhliche Dominanzerscheinungen. Der QI liegt zwischen 50 und 75. Die Fähigkeiten in der Schule sind gering außer einem relativ guten Interesse und Fertigkeit im Lesen. Beson‐ders charakteristisch sind typisch emotionell bedingte Handbewegungen (Reiben und Ringen), eine Röhrenstimme, ein abnormer Schlafrhythmus und eine sehr späte Kontrolle der Blasenfunktion. Diese gleichbleibende Kombination klinischer Erscheinungen kann schwerlich als zufallig betrachtet werden. In der Literatur fanden wir keine Berichte iiber ahnliche Kinder. RESUMEN Podria tratarse de un nuevo sindrome?. Aportacion de 1 casos con una degeneracidn mental y fisica caracteristicas En un perfodo de 5 años han sido vistos 7 niños que presentaban un estado especifico de degeneracyón ffsica y mental que aparecia de forma esporádica en familias que gozaban por otra parte de buena salud. El único factor predisponente posible era un trauma del parto presente en 5 ca sos. El cuadro constaba de letargia en los primeros meses de la vida, sequida de más de 10 años de gran excitabilidad y comportamiento tumultuoso con hiper motilidad. Existe un retraso en el desarrollo motor y una notable torpeza en los movimientos voluntarios. La cara es con frecuencia ancha y plana con cejas rectas. Más constante es la boca de “tipo de pato”, cuello corto y una ocasional lordosis postural (‘position de mara‐bii’). Los defectos asociados oculares que se presentan incluyen estrabismo, miopia grave y tendencia al desprendimiento de retina. Existe tambisén esquemás de dominancia alter‐nados. El CI oscila entre 50 y 75. El rendimiento excolar es pobre, excepto a lo que respecta a une relativa habilidad e interes para la lectura. Otras caracteristicas sobresalientes son movimientos de maños condicionados por la emotividad (restregárselas y estrujárselas), una voz de tipo tubular, un ritmo de sueño anormal y un control vesical muy tardio. Toda esta combinatión de caracteristicas clfnicas no pueden ser consideradas como simple coincidencia. No se han encontrado descritos en la literatura ningún caso similar.",

      "title": "Clinical Findings in Presenile Dementia A Report of 50 Cases",
      "abstract": "Fifty clinically diagnosed cases of presenile dementia were reviewed retrospectively, noting recorded symptomatology and findings on mental status, neurological and ancillary examinations at the time of definitive diagnosis. Manifest symptoms were numerous and varied over time but not in any uniform fashion which would allow the identification of stages of illness. The most frequent symptom was change in personality or behavior (78 per cent of the sample) whereas the most consistent symptom longitudinally was impairment of memory (present in at least 50 per cent of patients over time). A significant association of patient age at the time of symptom onset and at first physician contact with the character of the presenting symptoms at these times was identified. When symptoms were characteristically psychiatric rather than neurological in nature, patients had significantly earlier onset and earlier physician contact. Formal mental status examinations were notable in their consistently high frequency of classical signs of organic brain syndrome. Manifestations of psychosis and of a catastrophic reaction were uncommon. Neurological examination was abnormal in 84 per cent of the sample, with the most frequent finding being the presence of one or more release reflexes. Pneumoencephalography or computerized cerebral axial tomography was abnormal in all cases, in part a function of selection criteria. Electroencephalography was abnormal in 69 per cent of 48 cases, showing diffuse slowing in all but two instances. A normal electroencephalogram was present significantly more often when cerebral atrophy was limited to the cortical surfaces than when ventricular dilatation was present. Release reflexes were found to be significantly more common among patients with an abnormal as opposed to a normal electroencephalogram. No significant correlations among pattern and degree of cerebral atrophy, findings on neurological examination, signs of organic brain syndrome, and patient age and sex were apparent. Interpretation and implications of the results are discussed. The variability of clinical findings among patients, as well as over time, makes the establishment of specific diagnostic criteria difficult and raises again the question of whether presenile dementia constitutes a distinct clinical entity in the absence of tissue diagnosis.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "A post-traumatic vegetative state that holds for more than 12 months is defined as “permanent”, implying a very low probability of regaining consciousness. Here we report on a patient who emerged from a traumatic vegetative state after 20 months. Beginning from the 6th month, we observed an improvement in the event-related potentials (ERPs) of his brain to complex sensory and verbal stimulation, although the clinical examinations remained unchanged. The possible role of ERPs as predictors of regaining consciousness after a vegetative state is discussed.\n\nThe vegetative state is a most severe neurological syndrome and includes the loss of all kinds of conscious behaviour despite preserved wakefulness.1 In patients with traumatic head injury, a vegetative state that holds for more than 1 year is considered to be “permanent”, which implies irreversibility. In fact, even minimal improvement after this period is extremely improbable. From time to time, however, cases of late emergence are reported,2,3 sometimes even 5 years after the incident.4 The statement “The available data are insufficient to provide a trustworthy estimate of the incidence of late improvement” (Childs and Merger,3 p 24) is still valid; figures varying as broadly as from 1.6% to 14% have been reported.1,3\n\nGiven the rarity of such cases, the slightest hint that such an unexpected improvement may occur would be useful. Here we describe a patient in whom cognitive components of cortical ERPs were consistently obtained for more than 1 year before clinical recovery.\n\nA 28-year-old man was admitted to an intensive care unit with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 after a severe car accident. After 5 days, he regained vigilance but had diminished gaze fixation and could not follow even the simplest commands. Intensive stimulation resulted in generalised flexor responses. Three months …",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY West syndrome is including in the spectrum of encephalopathies of early beginning in lactation and childhood and is characterized by: spasm, psychomotor delay and hypsarrhythmic electroencephalogram, probably bound to factors of neurological development. Its prevalence is about 0, 15 to 0, 2/1000, in children under ten years old. When the causes are prenatal the spasm appears in the first three months of life, and those of other cause between nine months and two years of age. They are characterized by brief contractions in flexion, extension or both, generally are bilateral, symmetrical and two-phase. The duration of spasm varies from an isolated two seconds crisis, in the beginning, to one hundred spasms salve later. Epileptic seizures are the first manifestation of the syndrome, but the psychomotor delay can precede them, when initiating the spasms a development regression is evident. There is no sufficient evidence to determine the optimal dose of ACTH. High doses of 80-120 UI are not more effective than those of 20-40 UI. Prednisolone 2 mg/k/d, and hydrocortisone 15 mg/k/d by a month have had good effects. Vigabatrin is the more used antiepileptic medication. The crises yield in the first days of treatment, whereas the hypsarrhythmic pattern can delay 2-4 weeks more. When Down’s syndrome is the cause of the West syndrome pyridoxine has given good results. The surgical extirpation of epileptogenic focus, like cortical dysplasia, tumors, etc, has demonstrated utility, but it is not easy to identify epileptogenics areas before the 18 months even with positron emission tomography (PET).",

The primary symptom characteristic of PGAD is the presence of persistent, intrusive, and unwanted sensations of genital arousal. The genital arousal is typically localized to the labia minora and/or majora, the clitoris, and the region above the pubic bone. The presence of distress is a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of PGAD, and it is often what leads individuals to seek treatment. Individuals with PGAD often experience a high degree of associated psychosocial impairment. The healthcare experiences of individuals with PGAD appear to share many similarities with what has been reported for other forms of genital discomfort (such as vulvodynia). The etiology of the condition remains unknown. In terms of biological factors, both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system factors have been cited as potential contributors to PGAD.",

      "title": "Psychological Management of Multiple Sclerosis An Overview",
      "abstract": "Eight case histories demonstrate features of the predisposing childhood background met with in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) together with the passive dependent coping mechanisms adopted by the child to ensure short-term survival, but which perpetuated into adult life are inadequate and somatically damaging. First, there is pathological dependence on a parental key figure later transferred wholly or partly to other key figures. The pathological dependence leads to ambivalence over separation from the key figure(s) and the attainment of an independent emotional existence. The childhood of MS patients is overwhelming because it is either turbulent or excessively cloying, and the child's response passive and docile. Other siblings, for reasons such as position in the sibship, or their sex, or inherited toughness, escape the full rigour of parental dominance, or successfully rebel against it. MS subjects are thus especially vulnerable to threats of illness, death or irretrievable severance from key figures but, while detachment is perilous, they also fear and resent engulfment and the loss of any small measure of identity they may have gained. With their infantile attempts at separation at age of 2–3 frustrated, or too feeble for success, and having learned the 'giving-up' response as their only defence against what they see as hopeless odds, it is hardly surprising that bids for independence at adolescence are equally unsuccessful. They often recall a few attempts at adolescent rebellion painfully and quickly put down by the threat of withdrawal by the key figure. Often these adolescent or adult attempts at independence are associated with sexual relationships bedevilled by guilt from early libidinous fantasies, and fears of being trapped into parenthood and responsibility thereby threatening their own position as the dependent child. It is, therefore, no accident that the onset and relapses of MS are commonly associated with the crises courtship, marriage and birth. The women, if they are childless, which is often the case because of their own hang-ups, not infrequently fantasise their sisters' or friends' babies as their own. Because of their superficial affability, men and women are vulnerable to the trauma of being made unwilling confidants especially in the sexual misdemeanours of their neighbours, friends, parents, siblings, children and grandchildren, and identify closely with injured parties; such experiences are frequently provocative of onset nd relapse of MS. MS patients conceal emotions, particularly aggressive emotions, behind a mask. The mask they wear is either smiling, or 1 Based on a paper read to the Society for Psychosomatic Research, London 1976. Paulley 27 unsmiling and flat. The flat mask may incorrectly be interpreted as depression. The moria seen with the brain damage of GPI parallels the gross euphoria of advanced cases of MS, but both are caricatures of the basic mood antedating the disease. Relatives and friends as well as the patient will confirm that the smiling or unsmiling mask is premorbid and an early learned defence to conceal real feelings too dangerous to reveal. In this series there is a predominance of eldest and youngest children, and the histories reveal that they are often the most exposed to the damaging factors mentioned. However, the figures are just below the level of statistical significance. Likewise, the number of only children seemed to be more than one would expect. Psychotherapy is directed to helping these patients in the therapeutic situation to show their feelings, sometimes for the first time in their lives, and bring into consciousness their unconscious habit of hiding more intense feelings behind a smiling or unsmiling mask, and then to learn to lower their defensive mask, not only in the therapeutic situation, but later in their interpersonal relationships. Of necessity this programme also involves helping the patient wherever possible to separate emotionally from his key figure and surrogates. Experience has shown that this is more effectively and rapidly achieved by couple therapy in which the spouse or fiancé(e) affords an empathetic extension of the therapeutic situation beyond the consulting room. It is necessary to maintain therapy over the dangerous period during which dependence becomes attenuated first by substitution of the therapist for the key figure and later by incorporation of the 'good parent' and extrusion of the 'bad'. Subsequently, the link with the therapist may be weakened by spaced interviews but with easy access to the therapist in the event of relapse. Successful psychotherapy is punctuated by substantial remissions of the somatic symptoms of MS.

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "abstract": "Mrs. S, age 50, has had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for approximately 10 years. She describes her mood as up and down and is referred by her neurologist for psychiatric assessment of mood swings and possible depression. Fatigue limits her ability to work full-time, perform household duties, socialize with friends and family, and enjoy mental or physical exercise. In addition, her 18-year-old daughter--an important source of psychological support--is planning to leave home. Mrs. S experienced depression 5 years ago during her divorce. She was prescribed paroxetine, 20 mg/d, and had a positive response. She took the medication for 6 months, then discontinued. One-half of MS patients experience major depression in their lifetimes, (1) and the suicide rate is approximately doubled in MS patients compared with the general population. (2) Depression in MS patients often has an atypical presentation, with irritability and anger being as prominent as sadness. (3) Not all emotional changes experienced by MS patients represent depressive disorders, however. When evaluating MS patients who are struggling with depression, you can help them by diagnosing comorbid mood disorders, determining suicide risk, and providing psychological support as they cope with the impact of their illness. MS disease course MS is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, characterized by: * inflammatory demyelination and gliosis * neuronal and axonal loss * a variety of presenting symptoms as different CNS regions are affected. Focal areas of demyelination followed by a reactive gliosis cause white matter lesions in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. Neurologic dysfunction can manifest as visual changes, spastic paresis, hypoesthesia and paresthesia, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. MS presentation also can include optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. MS symptoms often are intensified by heat exposure. After the initial episode, months or years may pass before additional neurologic symptoms appear. Based on its course, MS can be classified as: * relapsing-remitting, when the disease does not progress between attacks * secondary progressive, characterized by a gradually progressive course after an initial relapsing-remitting pattern * primary progressive, when patients experience gradual progressive disability from symptom onset (Table 1, page 80). CASE CONTINUED Progressing symptoms Mrs. S has had multiple MS presentations, including optic neuritis, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, and urinary incontinence. Recently, her MS symptoms have gradually progressed even in the absence of attacks, and her diagnosis has been revised to secondary progressive MS. During psychiatric evaluation, Mrs. S denies persistent changes in sleep or appetite. She describes fatigue that starts after physical exertion and increases as the day progresses. She denies feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, excessive guilt, and suicidal ideation and does not have a history of inappropriate anger or irritability. Diagnosing depression in MS Normal emotional adjustment to MS can include reactions to loss of function or changes in social or occupational roles. Further, MS patients--similar to non-MS patients--experience life changes and transitions not related to the illness, such as divorce or a grown child moving away. Emotional responses to life stressors often are self-limited but may warrant an adjustment disorder diagnosis if they are associated with excessive distress or substantial impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning (Table 2, page 82). (4) Female MS patients and those who report high stress or a family history of affective disorder may be more likely to develop clinical depression. (5) Several studies have reported correlations between structural brain abnormalities and depression in MS. …",

They present with physical symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness; neurological symptoms such as seizures, and focal neurological deficit; and behavioral changes manifesting as depression (15–20%), anxiety (30–50%), psychosis (&lt;5%), and personality changes (16–76%). Therefore, it is necessary to do an appropriate general, neurological, and behavioral examination for proper diagnosis and management. A series of four cases who reported to psychiatric outpatient with behavioural complaints and no focal neurological deficits were reported. The most common presentation of SOLs is seizure, headache, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. Along with this complaint, some patients may present with abnormal behavior. However, it is very rare for a SOL to present solely with psychiatric or behavioral complaints. Therefore, it becomes imperative to keep a close watch on the symptoms and send for timely investigations.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

In spite of a high prevalence of sexual disorders secondary to psychopharmacological agents, there is a paucity of studies in the medical literature that clearly document the magnitude of the problem. Most reported instances of sexual disorders etiologically related to psychotropic medication are found in case reports and case series. The differential diagnosis of sexual dysfunction includes the sexual disorders associated with mental illness. In order to identify the etiology of sexual dysfunction in a patient with a mental disorder, the clinician must take a careful sexual history during the initial phase of treatment. Most patients do not spontaneously report sexual dysfunction to their therapists during the first session [1]. Decisions about prescribing psychotropic agents without establishing the baseline sexual functioning of a patient may obfuscate the process of differentiating between a sexual dysfunction caused by medication and one preexisting secondary to a mental disorder. Underreporting by patients during the initial interview does not preclude clinicians' exploring data",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of research diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in the DSM-IV recognizes the fact that some women have extremely distressing emotional and behavioral symptoms premenstrually. PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which presents with milder physical symptoms, headache, and more minor mood changes. In addition, PMDD can be differentiated from premenstrual magnification of physical and/or psychological symptoms of a concurrent psychiatric and/or medical disorder. As many as 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles experience some symptoms of PMS, according to epidemiologic surveys. PMDD is much less common; it affects only 3% to 8% of women in this group. The etiology of PMDD is largely unknown, but the current consensus is that normal ovarian function (rather than hormone imbalance) is the cyclical trigger for PMDD-related biochemical events within the central nervous system and other target organs. The serotonergic system is in close reciprocal relationship with the gonadal hormones and has been identified as the most plausible target for interventions. Thus, beyond the conservative treatment options such as lifestyle and stress management, other nonantidepressant treatments, or the more extreme interventions that eliminate ovulation altogether, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are emerging as the most effective treatment option for this population. Results from several randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with PMDD have clearly demonstrated that the SRIs have excellent efficacy and minimal side effects. More recently, several preliminary studies indicate that intermittent (premenstrual only) treatment with selective SRIs is equally effective in these women and, thus, may offer an attractive treatment option for a disorder that is itself intermittent.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Suicide is a traumatic event for close relatives due to various factors, with bullying acting as a mediator. Bullying has been identified as a primary predictor of suicidal ideation and a contributing factor to suicide. Objective: This study aims to describe the pathway from bullying victimization to suicidal attempts in adolescents. Results: Adolescence is a period of peak physical health and a time of behavioral and emotional problems due to developmental factors, which can increase susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Adolescents who experience bullying report suicidal ideation more frequently, often on a weekly basis, due to psychiatric morbidity (OR = 7.78). The relationship between bullying and suicide is mediated by poor physical and mental health, especially among victims. Bullying victimization triggers psychological or behavioral problems that can lead to suicidal behavior, often mediated by mental health or psychological problems, such as internalization or substance use which serve as maladaptive coping strategies, with suicide ultimately becoming a final coping strategy. Conclusion: Psychological or mental health problems mediate the risk of suicidal attempts among bullied adolescents, although other pathways may also be involved.",

Three systems of organs are involved in the male sexual act, and a disorder in any one of them may prevent its successful completion. The function of the nervous system is most important, particularly in the psychic sphere. While organic lesions of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves may produce impotence, the latter is usually so overshadowed by other manifestations as to make it incidental. One may summarise the position of the endocrine system by saying that the anterior lobe of the pituitary governs the development and function of the testes which, in turn, control the development and function of the sex characters and accessory sex organs. Thus a reduction in the function of either anterior pituitary or testes will reduce or abolish potency. Impotence due to such disturbances is readily recognised.",

Of these, severe mental retardation (IQ &amp;lt;50) occurs in about 10% (3 or 4 per 1,000 persons) and mild mental retardation (IQ 50 to 70) in 90%. 2. The high familial occurrence, the continuously variable phenotype shading into normality, and various genetic studies suggest that most of mild mental retardation represents the left end of the normal IQ distribution curve. Virtually no such cases can be found in the group of the severely retarded, either within or outside the institutions, suggesting that the majority of severe mental retardation represents discontinuous phenotypes due to chromosomal, environmental, mendelian, and multifactorial causes. 3. Some mild mental retardation represents syndromal occurrence (ie, mild PKU, rubella syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome); however, in most cases no anomalies are found, chromosomes are normal, height and head circumference fall within normal limits, and few have neurologic deficits, such as cerebral palsy and/or seizures. In the mildly retarded, personal, emotional and psychosocial problems predominate. The severely retarded are a biologically different group with a high incidence of gross neurologic disturbances, growth failure, abnormal head circumference, single or multiple malformations, and metabolic diseases. 4. The severely retarded are generally infertile, the mild retarded less fertile than average; however, a small minority among the latter contributes a disproportionately large number of retarded offspring to the next generation. 5. Most mental retardation can be evaluated on an outpatient basis for causal, pathogenetic, and prognostic factors. The evaluation can be economic, quick, reliable, painless, and efficient in most instances; however, CNS degenerative diseases may require a brief inpatient stay for biochemical evaluation. By all odds the most informative items in the work-up of the retarded are the (family and past) history and the (physical and neurologic) examination. Metabolic screening is usually not indicated in the malformed, neither are cytogenetic studies in the nonmalformed. 6. All patients with mental retardation deserve a diagnostic/causal evaluation and their families prognostic/genetic counseling. 7. Some 70% of mental retardation in the general population can be attributed to genetic causes. Genetic counseling in severe mental retardation is to prevent recurrence in siblings; in the mildly retarded much greater emphasis is placed on the prevention of retarded offspring.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disease characterized by the presence of an urge to move the legs accompanied by unpleasant sensations in the legs. The symptoms appear or increase in the evening and during the night, they are provoked by rest, and are totally or partially relieved by moving the legs [1, 2] . Diagnosis of RLS is based solely on the presence of the abovementioned symptoms without any definite objective measurement. The etiology of RLS remains unclear, but the strongest evidence supports the ‘iron theory’: symptoms of RLS are a result of peripheral and central iron deficiency leading to disturbances in dopaminergic transmission [3] . RLS is a frequent disorder – primary RLS was found in 2.4% of the general population in a recent study [4] . In another study, RLS of any form (primary and secondary) and of any frequency of symptoms was found in 7.2% of the general population [5] . The above facts (subjectivity of the symptoms, unclear etiology and high frequency in the general population) should be remembered when analyzing the data on the prevalence of RLS in other diseases.

      "title": "Conversion and Somatization in Pediatrics",
      "abstract": "Although conversion disorder rarely is diagnosed formally in ordinary pediatric practice, busy pediatricians often do encounter the phenomenon of conversion. Conversion is the experiencing of unacceptable emotional conflicts as symptoms, usually but not always physical, rather than as mental events. Conversion is commonplace, affecting almost all body systems. It must be recognized and managed appropriately early in its course, lest inappropriate evaluations and treatments occur; in addition to their other costs, such unnecessary procedures may introduce the child inadvertently to such symptomatization as a life-long pattern of behavior. More than a century ago, Briquet recognized that at least 50% of adult \"professional patients\" begin their symptomatic careers before puberty; thus, inappropriate care of the young patient who has conversion symptoms may have serious, long-lasting consequences. Problems in Diagnosing Conversion The traditional diagnostic elements of conversion often are difficult to demonstrate in pediatric practice. Almost all are either not specific to conversion or hard to confirm in young patients for reasons of developmental immaturity. These \"standard\" elements include the following: • Stress or conflict preceding symptoms (true of many illnesses) • Unconscious symptom production outside the patient's awareness (thus often inaccessible to the pediatrician) • A model for the symptom (either unverifiable or prone to observer bias) • Primary gain or relief of underlying conflict (again, difficult to confirm)",

No specific patient stereotype nor single risk factor can be used to easily identify which person or patient will attempt suicide. Mental health professionals often have to assess or manage suicide risk and this is challenging by reason of accurate methods of predicting remain elusive. Presence of multiple risk factors often suggest the need for additional evaluation for suicidal ideation, but an impending suicide attempt is not always recognized, even after evaluation by healthcare provider. More half of suicidals have seen a psychiatrist or psychologist or other healthcare provider within one month beforehand. The presentation of possible warning signs can be subtle and experience is required. Service provision for suicidal patients is often substandard, particularly at times of highest need such as after discharge from hospital or emergency department. As many as 75% or more of people who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental health disorder at the time of their death. The most common are bipolar disorder and schizophrenia over major depression. Between 25% and 50% of bipolar patients will attempt suicide at least once, and 5% to 20% will die by suicide. In schizophrenia diagnosis, 20% to 40% of patients will attempt suicide and more than 10% will die by suicide. Additional risk factors: alcohol misuse, family history, illegal substance use.

The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

      "abstract": "RESUMO: Introducao: Epilepsia e uma desordem cerebral caracterizada pela predisposicao duradoura para ocorrencia de crises epilepticas, as quais sao a expressao clinica de descargas neuronais corticais hipersincronicas. Sem fronteiras raciais, geograficas ou sociais, a epilepsia e uniformemente distribuida em todo o mundo, com predominio na populacao idosa. A caracterizacao clinica das crises e suficiente para o diagnostico, mas este pode ser refinado por exames complementares (eletroencefalograma e neuroimagem). Tais crises podem reproduzir ou bloquear todos os tipos de comportamento motores e nao motores: desde crises convulsivas tonico-clonicas generalizadas, ate piloerecao em antebraco, por exemplo. As manifestacoes atipicas dessas crises foram definidas pela semiologia clinica, quando atenderem aos seguintes criterios: nao estiverem descritas na Classificacao Internacional das Crises Epilepticas e/ou sua semiologia clinica for sugestiva de crise nao epileptica e o eletroencefalograma (EEG) comprovar que se trata de crise epileptica. O amplo espectro clinico dessas crises frequentemente promove um retardo no diagnostico, ocasionando prejuizos ao tratamento e prognostico. Destaca-se a necessidade de reconhecer as crises atipicas, a fim de diminuir o numero de pacientes subdiagnosticados e, portanto, sem o tratamento adequado. Pretende-se, por meio deste estudo, avaliar a prevalencia e a semiologia das crises epilepticas atipicas (CEA) nos pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia. Metodologia: Estudo transversal, com 1244 pacientes atendidos no ambulatorio de epilepsia do Hospital Universitario da Universidade Federal de Alagoas (HU-UFAL), entre fevereiro de 2013 e maio de 2019. A presenca de CEA, sua semiologia ictal e sua relacao com o perfil epidemiologico dos pacientes foram analisadas. Foram incluidos os pacientes diagnosticados com epilepsia e excluidos 305 pacientes, por apresentarem um diagnostico duvidoso de epilepsia e/ou por terem comprometimento cognitivo suficiente para comprometer a clareza das informacoes prestadas. Resultados e discussao: Foi observada uma prevalencia de 5,79% de pacientes com componente atipico de crises epilepticas, dos quais 1,85% apresentaram crises exclusivamente atipicas. Neste grupo, observou-se a hegemonia do sexo feminino e de pacientes com idade acima de 50 anos, ambos com prevalencia de 60,8%. Alem disso, nos pacientes com CEA, houve um predominio evidente de crises com um componente focal, com sindrome epileptica indeterminada,  exame neurologico normal e com uma frequencia  de mais de uma crise por mes. Conclusao: As crises epilepticas atipicas descritas no trabalho caracterizam-se por manifestacoes escassamente ou nunca descritas na literatura. A nossa proposta de definicao de CEA ajudou a caracterizar esse tipo de crise e a situa-la no contexto das CE em geral. Observamos uma expressiva prevalencia de CEA nos pacientes com epilepsia. Reconhecer essas crises facilita o diagnostico precoce das epilepsias. A partir desse diagnostico, pode-se identificar as causas subjacentes, potencialmente trataveis. Desse modo, sera possivel mudar o prognostico do controle das crises e de suas causas, como tumores cerebrais, encefalites, acidentes vasculares cerebrais, disturbios metabolicos.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "title": "171 MSK injury likelihood is increased during the 4-month period after a concussion",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> There is evidence that concussion can increase the risk of sustaining a subsequent musculoskeletal (MSK) injury up to 24-months post injury. The reason for increased risk is unknown although irregularities in brain and motor function post-concussion that are sustained beyond clinical recovery have been implicated. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine the likelihood of UK High Performance System athletes sustaining a subsequent MSK injury within a 4-month period post-concussion. <h3>Design</h3> Retrospective Cohort Study. A concussion was identified by a medical records diagnostic code of 'concussion without loss of consciousness', 'concussion with loss of consciousness', or 'concussion not otherwise specified'. The attrition rate is the average occurrence of an MSK injury during the 4-month period. An attrition rate for all MSK injuries was determined using the formula; 'Number of MSK Injuries'/'Number of Athletes'. An attrition rate for all MSK injuries subsequent to a concussion was determined by the formula; 'Number of MSK injuries that occur in the 4-months after a concussion'/'Number of Athletes who sustained a concussion'. <h3>Setting</h3> UK High Performance System Olympic and Paralympic athletes <h3>Participants</h3> 1979 athletes from 33 sports <h3>Main Outcome Measurements</h3> MSK attrition rate compared to MSK/Concussion attrition rate. <h3>Results</h3> Athletes were found to have a 27% increased risk of suffering a MSK injury 4-months post-concussion, with the overall MSK attrition rate of 0.78, increasing to 0.99 post-concussion. A higher MSK/Concussion attrition rate was identified in 26 of 33 sports. <h3>Conclusions</h3> There is an increased risk of sustaining a MSK injury post-concussion amongst UK Olympic and Paralympic programme athletes. Therefore, identifying and addressing risk factors for subsequent MSK injury should be considered during concussion rehabilitation. This might include visio-motor, oculo-motor, balance and neuromuscular impairments alongside screening, monitoring and programming physical preparation to ensure any work-load imbalances associated with time away from sport are addressed.",

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

Bis zu 20 % der über 65-Jährigen leiden an einer depressiven Störung und etwa 6 % davon erfüllen die diagnostischen Kriterien einer depressiven Episode. Häufig stehen jedoch bei dieser Klientel andere Erkrankungen im Vordergrund und die Beschwerden werden als körperliche Erkrankungen oder \"normale\" Alterserscheinung (Agism) fehlinterpretiert. Erschwerend kommt dazu, dass Depressionen im Alter oft atypisch bzw. subsyndromal verlaufen, d. h. die depressiven Syndrome erfüllen nicht alle Kriterien einer Depression nach den internationalen Klassifikationssystemen. So kann das Gefühl von Traurigkeit oder gedrückter Stimmung fehlen und stattdessen Schmerzen, Gedächtnisstörungen, Wahn, Reizbarkeit, Agitiertheit oder Schlafstörungen dominieren. Insbesondere bei männlichen älteren Patienten sind Schlafstörungen und Wutausbrüche Indikatoren für eine Depression, die nicht auf die leichte Schulter genommen werden sollten, mahnte Wollmer.

      "abstract": "Depression: Everyone gets the blues now and then, but when there is little joy or pleasure after visiting with friends or after seeing a good movie, there may be a more serious problem. A depressed mood that stays around for a while, without letting up, can change the way a person thinks or feels. Doctors call this depression.Depression is a common, serious illness and not a personal weakness. Depression can happen to anyone, at any age, and to people of any race or ethnic group. It is never a part of life. Depression, which is treatable, can come from chemical imbalances in the brain, hormonal changes, medications or things going on in your life.Although there has been evidence for some time of a sex difference in depression, relatively little research has examined the developmental process by which women come to be at greater risk than men for depression. One out of four women may have depression sometime during their lifetime. Many people suffer with depression but do not seek help.The sense of one's identity or self is an important dimension of individual's personality giving each one of us unique individuality. Women and depression is holding a relationship of much interest over the last two decades. As more and more women enter the work force, they are increasingly exposed not only of the same work environment as men, but also to unique pressure created by multiple roles and conflicting expectations (Nelson & Burke, 2000). It has long been observed that women are about twice as likely to become clinically depressed (to have dysthmia or unipolar depression) as are men. These differences occur in most countries around the world (Nolen - Hoeksemo & Girgus, 1994; Whilelm & Roy, 2003).Depression is normal features of our lives. Modernity brought women education in its wake and she changed the arena of activity. She stepped out of the threshold ofhouse and joined service like man. Now she got admiration, equality and opportunity. But the euphoria was ephemeral as she was supposed to take to this job as an additional responsibility. She not expected to shrink household work. This brought problems like strain and depression (Pillai & Sen, 1998).A women by nature is expressive emotional and sensitive. Physiological social and cultural background of women probably plays a key role in mending a women's attitude and natures towards the external relation we know that women are generally more at risk to develop psychological disorder and depression in particular.Objectives of the study* To find out effect of age on depression among working women.* To find out effect of experience on depression among working womenHypotheses of the study* There is significant variation in depression among employees based on age* There is significant variation in the depression among the employees based on their experience.MethodParticipantsThe study was conducted in Delhi and Gurgaon, India with a sample of 200 women professionals.

      "title": "Decisional Capacity and Personality Disorders: Substantially Unable or Substantially Unwilling?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Capacity assessments are performed when there is suspicion that a person is unable to adequately care for their physical, medical, or financial well‐being. The purpose of these assessments is to inform the legal system as to whether or not guardianship may be necessary. It is well established that certain mental illnesses, such as neurocognitive disorders (dementia) or psychotic disorders (like schizophrenia), may diminish capacity and, in some cases, lead to the need for establishment of a legal guardian. However, personality disorders are another common category of mental illness which may impair decision‐making. There is very little information in the literature about how or why these disorders could impair capacity, and thus, it can often be difficult to discern whether clients with personality disorders are substantially unable to care for themselves—versus unwilling to act in a way contrary to their ingrained habits. We present a series of three cases in which clients are determined to lack capacity primarily mediated by a personality disorder diagnosis. They are demonstrated to have mild deficits in cognitive functioning, but they show impaired decision‐making out of proportion to these deficits. In all three cases, it is apparent that the personality disorder is substantially impairing their ability to care for themselves. Discussion includes consideration for ways to incorporate evaluations of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and personality considerations into capacity assessments, and how to approach recommendations (such as guardianship vs. less restrictive option) based on both level and scope of impairment.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Sequelae of Severe Closed Head Injury",
      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "abstract": "Excoriation (Skin-Picking) disorder is a clinically recognized condition which was recently included in the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM) - fifth edition, as OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) related disorder. The disorder's official status has been achieved due to its high frequency and unique clinical picture involving both mental and physical impairment. In this article, we would like to present a concise review of the literature together with an illustrative case. Epidemiological surveys show a prevalence of 3% to 5% for the general population, with heterogeneous gender and age distribution. In recent years the disorder has been categorized under the family of BFRB's (Body Focused Repetitive Behaviours). However, there are some elements associated with movement suppression and tic disorders, as well as disorders belonging to obsessive-compulsive spectrum. The treatment of this disorder may be pharmacological and/or psychological. There is some evidence for the benefit of some SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) agents as well as for N-Acetyl-Cysteine. Various psychological treatments have been investigated and some of them have proven to be effective. These include cognitive behavioural protocols, some of which have been developed specifically for this disorder.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "title": "CLINICAL STUDIES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA",
      "abstract": "The scrutiny of this small group of patients, presenting a serious deterioration of insidious onset, reveals as outstanding factors the constitutional inadequacy of the individual patient and the unfavorable external factors which conditioned and frustrated him. Two of the patients developed pulmonary tuberculosis, but the clinical picture and course in these 2 patients were not markedly different from those of the other 7 patients. One may say that in this group the physical examination revealed no adequate cause for the onset of the deterioration. The clinical picture and course of the mental disorder in this group may be outlined as follows: The patient in adolescence or early adult life, without any adequate explanation in the way of physical illness or drastic change in the environment, begins to show a striking loss of sociability, initiative, interest and personal care. The course is as a rule steadily downwards, ending in a parasitic existence at a very low level. With the abeyance of the superior functions, with the loss of social response, of spontaneity, and of interest, there occur, perhaps as release phenomena, reactions of a lower neurological level—meaningless smiling and laughter, explosive outbursts of anger, occasional autoerotism, mannerisms and grimaces, automatic movements. Memory may be retained to a surprising extent; incoherence is frequently noted but the patient is uncommunicative. There is no special manifestation of basic urges, of underlying preoccupations, of repressed and dissociated factors. There seems to be a lack of vital energy associated with the egoistic as with the more complex social trends. The condition is one of defect rather than of conflict. In the comparative absence of tension, or turmoil, of compensatory strivings or phantasies, the clinical picture makes the impression of self-abandonment, of surrender, of acceptance of life at a lower automatic level. This surrender may be further evidence of the constitutional defect of vitality of the organism already indicated in childhood and made more manifest in face of the demands of the independent, mature, social life. The challenge of life to these underprivileged, poorly conditioned, and frustrated individuals is beyond their capacity. While others with somewhat different endowment react with hysterical or compulsive evasions, with affective slumps or sprees, with imaginative phantasies or regressive dramatisations, this group differently endowed reacts to the challenge with a simple surrender. If we continue to retain these patients within the hospitable group of schizophrenia, it may be legitimate to characterize their special type of reaction as schizophrenic \"surrender.\" In the further analysis of the conditions of this \"surrender\" the inadequacy or abiotrophy of component systems of the organism requires to be investigated and evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Premature ejaculation (PE) corresponds to “a persistent or recurring ejaculation pattern that occurs during sexual activity with a partner approximately 1 minute after vaginal penetration and before the person wishes to”. It affects 5–20% of men, having its origin in psychological factors and with important biological contribution. It is considered generalised, when not confined to certain patterns of stimulation, situations, or partners, or may be situational. It may occur soon after the onset of sexual activity (primary) or after a normal sexual functioning (acquired). Primary EP is associated with the hyposensitivity 5-HT2C receptors and/or hypersensitivity 5-HT1A receptors. High performance anxiety levels are related to acquired EP. Increasing this physiological knowledge has enabled significant advances in treatment. Objective Approach the therapeutic options of EP and its peculiarities. Methods Literature review of articles published in the last five years, using the PubMed and Scielo databases. Results At present, the approaches include psychosexual counseling, behavioral and pharmacotherapy. Among the most popular drugs, antidepressants stand out, particularly dapoxetine, the first medication specifically approved. Local anesthetics, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and tramadol are also used. Acupuncture is suggested as a useful therapeutic, but needs more research. Conclusion The behavioral therapies are referred to as first-line treatment in the long-term, associated or not with medication. Dapoxetine is the preferred symptomatic treatment. However, a holistic approach, including psychotherapy and sex therapy, is the most beneficial modality for sexual and marital relationship.

Its status as a clinical syndrome of childhood remains unclear. Many controversies surround various facets of this condition, foremost among these are questions relating to the duration of depressive disorders, the likelihood of recurrence, and the long-term outcome of depressed children. In the course of addressing these issues, attention is devoted to the outcomes as well as the advantages and disadvantages of commonly used research designs (prospective, retrospective, and catch-up prospective), the level of diagnosis used (symptom, syndrome, disorder), the significance of the age of onset on severity, and specific areas in need of further research. Among the tentative conclusions, it is asserted that many depressive symptoms are transient, diminishing or disappearing with age and/or changing environmental circumstances, but that severe depressive disorders do persist, with periods of remission, at least into the early adult years.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background:</h3> Systemic manifestations are common in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and play a major role in the prognosis. Neurological complications may affect both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). The incidence varies from several to several dozen percent. The course of the disease and the severity of the symptoms may be mild and self-limiting or progressive, leading to permanent neurological deficits. It is worth remembering that the symptoms of nervous system involvement may precede the onset of symptoms of dryness, and diagnosis of pSS may be delayed after a certain duration of neurological symptoms. <h3>Objectives:</h3> The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of PNS involvement among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with the diagnosis of pSS in our University Clinical Centre. <h3>Methods:</h3> We studied a consecutive group of fifty unselected patients aged from 33 to 74 years (mean 55.8 years). All patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of pSS. Additional connective tissue diseases and diabetes were the exclusion criteria. Disease activity was evaluated according to the EULAR Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI). All patients underwent clinical neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) of nine peripheral nerves. For the classification of polyneuropathies the ESTEEM (European Standardized Telematic tool to Evaluate Electrodiagnostic Methods) guidelines were used. Clinical examination and nerve conduction study were performed and evaluated by one certified neurologist. <h3>Results:</h3> Of our 50 patients, 48 were female with a mean (±SD) age 53.6±10.5 years and mean disease duration 7.9±5.3 years. Two were male with mean age 43.7±25.8 years and mean disease duration 5.7±0.6 years. The mean age at diagnosis was 50.4±14 years. 23 (46%) patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of neuropathy. The most common PNS manifestation was sensorimotor neuropathy 11/23 (47%), mononeuropathy was present in 6/23 (26%) patients, pure axonal sensory neuropathy was present in 1/23 (4.3%) patient, axonal motor neuropathy in 1/23 (4.3%), SFN in 1/23 (4.3%) and cranial nerve involvement was present in 4/23 (17.4%) (one of the patients had both cranial and sensorimotor neuropathy). Neurological symptoms preceded the diagnosis of pSS in 8 (35%) of 23 PNS+ patients. The frequency of following symptoms and extraglandular manifestations was significantly higher in PNS+ compared to PNS- patients: salivary gland enlargement (74% vs 44% p&lt;0,05), respiratory tract involvement (65% vs 37% p&lt;0,05) and lymphadenopathy (61% vs 19% p&lt;0,05). The mean ESSDAI in patients with and without neurological involvement was 7±6,82 and 4,7±4,58 respectively (p=0.245). In this subgroup the use of cyclophosphamide, due to extraglandular manifestations, was increased (p&lt;0,05). <h3>Conclusion:</h3> We found that PNS involvement is a common extraglandular manifestation of pSS (46% in our group). Sensorimotor neuropathies were most frequent. Involvement of the PNS seems frequent but remains underestimated. NCS is a non-invasive test which might be useful at diagnosis and follow-up. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral neuropathies in patients with pSS are needed. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

At entry, all subjects were free of prior seizures and other neurologic, medical, and psychiatric disorders with the potential to impair cognition. Although no control subject developed seizures during the study period, 7 subjects with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type had at least one documented seizure. All 7 subjects had progressed to the severe stage of dementia by the time of the first seizure. Seizures were generalized tonic-clonic in type and were unassociated with clinical or (in 3 subjects) neuropathologic evidence for epileptogenic factors other than Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that advanced Alzheimer's disease alone may be an important risk factor for new-onset seizures in older adults.",

A clear definition has, however, recently been agreed.1 The Rome consensus states that symptoms should be chronic and recurring and consist of abdominal pain that is clearly related to bowel function, being either relieved by defecation or associated with a change in frequency or consistency of stool with or without disturbed defecation, which is defined as two or more of the following: altered stool frequency, altered stool form (hard, loose, or watery), altered stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete defecation), and passage of mucus. The above symptoms are usually associated with bloating or a sense of abdominal distension. The syndrome excludes painless constipation and diarrhoea and also chronic abdominal pain that is unrelated to bowel movement in which psychiatric features predominate.\n\nIrritable bowel symptoms are experienced by 8-22% of the population,2 but most learn to cope with their symptoms and less than one third actually consult a doctor. Consulters differ from non-consulters in being less easily reassured and more anxious, depressive, and prone to multiple complaints.2 3 4 This pattern is …",

      "title": "Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by recurrent acute sensory and motor neuropathy in a single or multiple nerves. The most common initial manifestation is the acute onset of a non-painful focal sensory and motor neuropathy in a single nerve (mononeuropathy). The first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade but earlier onset is possible. Neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a common manifestation. Recovery from acute neuropathy is usually complete; when recovery is not complete, the resulting disability is mild. Some affected individuals also demonstrate a mild-to-moderate peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HNPP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and electrophysiologic findings and either the 1.5-Mb recurrent deletion or a novel deletion involving PMP22 (in 80%), or a PMP22 sequence variant (in 20%) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves occupational therapy and physical therapy as needed to address issues with fine motor and gross motor skills, including activities of daily living. Bracing, such as with a wrist splint or ankle-foot orthosis, may be useful transiently or in some instances permanently. Special shoes, including those with good ankle support, may be needed. Neuropathic pain can be treated with analgesic medications. Protective pads at elbows or knees may prevent pressure and trauma to local nerves. Surveillance: Routine screening neurologic examination focused on muscle atrophy, strength, sensory loss, and neuropathic pain; physical and occupational therapy assessments of gross motor and fine motor skills and activities of daily living; foot examinations for pressure sores or poorly fitting footwear. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged sitting with legs crossed; prolonged leaning on elbows; occupations requiring repetitive movements of the wrist; rapid weight loss; vincristine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Asymptomatic relatives at risk may wish to clarify their genetic status by undergoing molecular genetic testing for the PMP22 pathogenic variant identified in an affected family member in order to be advised about agents and circumstances to avoid. Genetic counseling HNPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 20% of individuals with HNPP have the disorder as the result of a de novo PMP22 pathogenic variant. Each child of an affected individual is at a 50% risk of inheriting the PMP22 pathogenic variant. Once the PMP22 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is considered as a great human value related to happiness and satisfaction, but unfortunately, when affecting mental disorders, they tend to be associated with second level human functions. Nevertheless, sexual dysfunction often accompanies psychiatric disorder, intensely influencing compliance, quality of life and human relationships. Sexuality could be influenced either by a mental disorder itself, difficulties to get and maintain couple relationships or by the use of psychotropic treatments. Treatment-related adverse events are unfortunately under-recognized by clinicians, scarcely spontaneously communicated by patients, and rarely investigated in clinical trials. The most frequent psychotropic compounds that could deteriorate sexuality and quality of life include antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood regulators. There are important differences between them related to some variations in mechanisms of action including serotonin, dopamine and prolactin levels. Little is known about the relevance of sexuality and its dysfunctions in chronic and frequent mental and neurological disorders, such as psychosis, mood disorders, anxiety, phobias, eating disorders, alcohol or drug dependencies, epilepsy and childhood pathology. Poor sexual life, low satisfaction and more frequent risky sex behavior than in the general population are associated with severe mental diseases. There is a need for increasing research in this field, including epidemiological, psychological, neurophysiological, neuroanatomical and genetic variables related to sexual life to get a better understanding of the implicated mechanisms. To increase the sensibility of clinicians, the identification and management of sexual disturbances after the onset of any mental disorder should be highlighted. This would avoid unnecessary suffering and deterioration of quality of life.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

Although more than 50 steroids are produced within the adrenal cortex, cortisol and aldosterone are far the most abundant and physiologically active. In primary adrenocortical insufficiency, glucocorticoid and mineral-corticoid properties are lost; however, in secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (i.e., secondary to disease or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis), mineralocorticoid function is preserved. Every emergency physician should be familiar with adrenocortical insufficiency--a potentially life-threatening entity. The initial diagnosis and decision to treat are presumptive and are based on history, physical examination, and, occasionally, laboratory findings. Delay in treatment while attempting to confirm this diagnosis can result in poor patient outcomes.

The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

      "abstract": "Factitious disorder involves feigning, exaggerating, or self-inducing physical and/or psychological ailments with the goal of assuming the \"sick\" or \"patient\" role. In turn, the sick role entitles the factitious disorder patient to care, nurturance, and protection; it also exempts one from usual responsibilities. In this paper, we present the first reported case of factitious pedophilia. Although it seems counterintuitive, this middle-aged man has falsely claimed or exaggerated sexual desire for minors ostensibly to remain in a state hospital; indeed, he has remained in the same inpatient facility for more than 20 years as a result of his deceptions. At times, his reports have included disconfirmed claims of bizarre accidents and other physical travails. This case enlarges the literature on factitious psychological disorders and shows that some individuals may falsify paraphilic behaviors, although clearly minimization of these behaviors remains more common.",

      "abstract": "Piu dell’85% delle donne nel post-partum soffrono di disturbi dell’umore: nella maggior parte dei casi forme transitorie e lievi (“postpartum blues”), nel 15% forme piu severe (“depressione propriamente detta”) che possono sfociare in “psicosi”. Il caso da noi riportato riguarda una donna di 21 anni che, dopo aver partorito con taglio cesareo per ipossia acuta fetale, in 7a giornata di puerperio riferisce che “c’e qualcosa che non va”: si dimostra particolarmente stanca, irritata, triste. Nei giorni successivi la sintomatologia si acuisce. Alla consulenza psichiatrica le viene diagnosticata “depressione post-partum moderata” e dopo una terapia per 6 mesi con paroxetina la prognosi e stata buona sia per la madre che per il neonato. I disturbi psichiatrici del post-partum rappresentano un importante problema di sanita pubblica, che puo anche avere conseguenze negative sullo sviluppo fisico e comportamentale, oltre che poter mettere a rischio la vita del neonato (“infanticidio”). Le varie legislazioni europee infliggono una pena minore nei casi di infanticidio, e in Italia la legge che lo regolamenta e l’art. 578 del c.p., riformulato dalla legge n. 42 del 5/8/1981: “La madre che cagiona la morte del proprio neonato immediatamente dopo il parto, o del feto durante il parto, quando il fatto e determinato da condizioni di abbandono materiale e morale connessa al parto, e punita con la reclusione da 4 a 12 anni”. Data quindi la potenziale gravita di questo disturbo, e importante diagnosticarlo in fase precoce ed attuare delle misure terapeutiche appropriate, oltre che supporto psicologico.",

      "abstract": "The following are key factors to consider in assessing a patient for long-term neuroleptics: 1. Who--accurate diagnosis of schizophrenia is of primary concern. There are no good prognostic indicators other than a history of repeated relapses and positive responses to neuroleptics. 2. When and for how long--should always be considered for the patient who has had more than two acute episodes. The first year post-acute episode back in the community is extremely critical. Consider maintaining patient on tapering dosage of medication for at least four to five years. 3. What benefits--symptoms of acute psychosis respond, those of chronic defect state do not. Medication also can act as buffer against stress. 4. Dosages--standard range is the equivalent of 300-800 mg. of Thorazine for most patients. Dose range for depot administration of Prolixin decanoate is 25-62.5 mg. 2-4 week intervals. Differences within this range may not be important. Data about very low doses (one-tenth standard dose) and megadoses (4-5 times standard dose) are inconsistent. 5. Risks--extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and akinetic depression are the most prevalent risks. Extrapyramidal symptoms can often be controlled effectively with dosage reduction. However, anticholinergic drugs are the treatment of choice during acute phases, and for the first 3-5 months post-acute phase. Tardive dyskinesia rarely occurs after a few weeks or months, but occurs most commonly beginning after two years of drug treatment. The usual form is persistent, but transient forms also occur. The earliest signs are reversible in some patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Depression and Suicide",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Most youth occasionally experience the blues, feel sad, or become irritable. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the possibility of a depressive disorder when a depressed or irritable mood is more than temporary, occurs in conjunction with other symptoms, or interferes with daily functioning. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is manifested by a depressed or irritable mood or diminished interest or pleasure that lasts for at least 2 weeks. This is accompanied by changes in cognitive and physical functioning. Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a less severe type of depression that involves chronic symptoms and lasts for at least 1 year. These specific types of depressive disorders are the focus of this article.Depressive disorders can be identified in children of all ages, but they become increasingly prevalent during adolescence. In fact, the peak ages of depressive symptom onset in lifespan studies are 15 to 19 years and 25 to 29 years. The sharpest rise in prevalence occurs among girls during adolescence and early adulthood. Approximately 2% of school-age children and 4% to 6% of adolescents struggle with MDD at any one point in time. Lifetime prevalence rates by late adolescence range between 20% and 25%.Prior to puberty, there is about a 1:1 gender ratio for depressive disorders. After puberty, this shifts to a 2:1 ratio of females to males, which continues throughout adulthood. A combination of hormonal and social changes during puberty may explain the differing rates of depression among males and females.Depression has a complex genetic and environmental basis. Adoption, twin, and family studies all point to the impact of genetic factors, which seem to establish a young person's biologic vulnerability for depression. The onset of a depressive episode, however, often is precipitated by difficult life events or stressful experiences such as a parental divorce, school change, or relationship breakup. Other environmental risk factors include maltreatment (sexual abuse, physical abuse, or neglect). The pathways to depression are complex and variable. Some depressive disorders are more biologic; others are more situational.The symptoms of MDD and DD, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), include changes in physical, cognitive, and emotional domains (Tables 1 and 2).In 1996, the World Health Organization ranked depression among the most disabling of all diseases in the world, leading all other disorders in \"years lived with disabilities.\" The reasons for this are apparent when one considers the course of depressive illness. Approximately 70% of youth who have MDD experience another depressive episode within 5 years, and youth who have depressive disorders have a fourfold risk of an adult depressive disorder. Approximately 50% of children and adolescents who have MDD can be expected to have adult recurrences. Early onset and recurrences also have been described as a cause of treatment-resistant depression in later life, leading to multiple episodes that last longer, become more severe, and become more difficult to treat. These tend to be associated with more hospitalizations, job absenteeism, and impaired work performance.Depressive disorders in youth are associated with impaired functioning in several areas of daily living. These include strained family and peer relationships, school attendance difficulties, and academic performance problems. Affected youth often experience suicidal thoughts and are at increased risk for attempted and completed suicide.Early-onset bipolar disorder (BD) often presents as depressive symptoms, which can make it difficult to distinguish between bipolar and unipolar depression. BD is characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression. The inflated self-esteem, excess energy, and poor judgment that characterize a manic phase often result in dangerous activity and substantial social problems. Rapid cycling and mixed symptom states occur in subtypes of BD. Approximately 20% to 40% of children who have MDD eventually develop BD. Some clues to the risk for developing a manic or hypomanic episode include psychosis, psychomotor retardation, or a family history of BD.Another potential diagnostic dilemma occurs when a child or adolescent is abusing alcohol or drugs. Youth are not always forthcoming about such abuse, which may be associated with declining school performance, withdrawal from usual social activities, sleep disturbance, and negative moods. Careful questioning of the youth and parent/guardian is necessary to identify a substance use disorder in youth presenting with depressive symptoms. It can be equally challenging to identify a depressive disorder in youth initially identified for services because of problems related to alcohol or substance abuse.Most children and adolescents who are depressed also have a history of some other psychiatric or alcohol/drug use disorder. For example, 25% to 75% of depressed youth have one or more anxiety disorders, such as separation anxiety disorder or social phobia. Disruptive behavior disorders, such as attention-deficit disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, are also common, and substance abuse or dependence characterizes a significant minority of youth who are depressed. A gender difference exists in patterns of comorbidity. Girls more commonly have comorbid anxiety conditions; boys are more likely to have comorbid conduct disorders or substance use disorders.Children and adolescents rarely seek professional treatment. Thus, parents, teachers, pediatricians, and others who have regular contact with youth play critical roles in recognizing youth who are depressed. Few youth use the word \"depressed\"; even fewer report to someone that they may be experiencing a clinical depression. Therefore, it is helpful to ask youth about experiences of feeling down, \"bad,\" miserable, bored, or irritated. Signs of clinical depression that often initially are visible to others include withdrawal from activities, decline in school performance, change in sleep patterns, and sadness or irritability.The United States Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended the use of two questions in screening for depression among adults: \"Over the past 2 weeks, have you ever felt down, depressed, or hopeless?\" and \"Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?\" The Task Force concluded that evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of routine screening of children and adolescents, but these two questions may help clinicians detect primary symptoms of depression. More comprehensive screening instruments and diagnostic tools or a referral to a mental health professional should be considered if indicated. The Reynolds Adolescent Depression Inventory (RADS) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) are screening tools used in some school and mental health clinics.Clinical interviews are the cornerstone of a comprehensive assessment and should include, at a minimum, interviews with the youth as well as the parent or guardian. In addition to gathering a complete history of presenting problems (onset, chronicity, severity, prior history of symptoms, and treatment), a full psychiatric interview is conducted to obtain information about possible comorbid conditions. For example, it is critical to ascertain whether psychotic features, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance abuse problems are present. Information also is gathered about the youth's medical, developmental, social, and educational histories as well as the family psychiatric history.Important sources of information may include school academic and attendance records; teacher reports; and appropriate biomedical, psychological, or other test findings. Standardized self-report questionnaires may permit youths to answer questions about current symptoms without directly verbalizing the extent of their emotional distress to an adult. This approach sometimes can facilitate honest reporting of the number and severity of depressive symptoms. If noted in a self-report questionnaire, critical items always should be followed up with direct inquiry by the clinician (eg, if a youth reports suicidal ideation).The initial goals of treatment are to ensure the youth's safety and develop an effective therapeutic alliance with the youth and parents. This alliance will facilitate ongoing communication and continuation of care. Consultation with teachers and other caregivers also is important. A focus on patient and family education and a collaborative approach to treatment planning can enhance the youth's adherence to treatment recommendations.Psychoeducation is a key component of the treatment. Beyond this, perspectives on the first line of treatment vary. The choice of whether to begin with psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacologic interventions or a combination depends on depression severity and chronicity, prior history of depressive episodes, likelihood of adherence, previous response to treatment, patient and family motivation for treatment, and availability of resources. Because of the psychological, environmental, and social problems associated with depression and its treatment, pharmacotherapy usually is not sufficient as the sole treatment. Attention to parental mental health and family stress as well as to strategies for helping parents manage the youth's irritability, isolation, or other problems should be included in psychotherapeutic interventions. These systemic concerns affect treatment adherence and ultimate outcomes.Psychoeducation addresses the signs and symptoms of depression; the importance of psychotherapy and psychiatric medication; and common misconceptions about the illness, therapy, or medications. It also is helpful to address the impact that depression has on school, social, and family functioning and the ways in which parents and teachers may aid in recovery. Parent and family education may increase adherence and reduce self-blame. Education of parents can help them identify their own mood disorders and potential treatment needs as well. Education also can reduce blame for symptoms such as irritability and anhedonia that may affect others.Controlled studies have documented the short-term effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) for depressed youth. Both generally are time-limited therapies that involve collaboration or guided discovery between the therapist and adolescent. CBT focuses on self-understanding of negative mood states and on the identification and modification of negative, distorted thought patterns. It also emphasizes problem-solving skills, communication skills, and the development of more adaptive behavior patterns. IPT strives to improve the youth's interpersonal functioning by improving self-understanding, problem-solving, communication, and coping in the realm of relationships. It focuses on a chosen interpersonal problem such as grief, a difficult role transition, an interpersonal conflict or role dispute, social skill deficits, or issues in step-parent families. Although randomized, controlled clinical trials have not been conducted for psychodynamic therapy with depressed youth, this approach may be useful. Family therapy is an important supplement to any of these approaches if difficulties in family communication and support are identified. Goals of family therapy may include improving family affective communication, increasing adaptive behaviors, and changing both interpersonal and family functioning.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the antidepressants of choice for youth who require pharmacotherapy (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 1998). The efficacy of the SSRI fluoxetine in reducing depressive symptom severity in children and adolescents has been demonstrated in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Paroxetine also has demonstrated efficacy compared with imipramine and placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison. Other antidepressant medications are not well studied. Dosing guidelines recommend starting with 10 mg fluoxetine and increasing to 20 mg. The maximum dose is 40 mg to 80 mg. When treating a child younger than 8 years of age, clinicians may want to start with 4 to 8 mg elixir of fluoxetine. However, the efficacy and safety data have been demonstrated only down to age 8 years. If there are problems with insomnia, appetite loss, or restlessness, paroxetine is a more sedating SSRI, and dosing guidelines are identical to those for fluoxetine. SSRIs should be discontinued if symptoms of mania appear. However, youth may benefit from treatment with an SSRI for an extended period before BD develops.An adequate trial of SSRIs is at least 4 to 6 weeks. If no or only minimal improvement is observed, a dose increase should be considered and medication continued for at least 4 to 6 additional weeks. If no improvement has been observed, alternative strategies should be considered, including a referral to a psychiatrist in cases of treatment-resistant depression. Additionally, if the pediatrician is not comfortable in the prescriber role, a psychiatric consultation or referral to a physician experienced in the use of medication is recommended. Frequent medication adjustments are ill-advised, and tapering of medications that have shorter half-lives (eg, paroxetine) is recommended. Obtaining serum levels rarely is necessary unless concerns arise about toxicity or compliance. Studies among adults suggest that the same doses used to treat MDD are efficacious for DD.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are not considered a first-line treatment for children and adolescents who are depressed, but they may be helpful in treating youth who have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, and narcolepsy as well as for augmentation purposes.In contrast to TCAs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs have a relatively safe adverse effects profile, are easily used (once daily), are suitable for long-term maintenance, and have a low lethality after overdose. Additional information on adverse effects, medication interactions, and the treatment of comorbid conditions is available in reviews of practice recommendations published by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.ECT can be a useful adjunct for individuals whose depression is severe or life-threatening, who have not responded to other treatments, who cannot take antidepressant medications, and who may have psychotic depression. The decision to use ECT must be made carefully and usually requires the recommendation of more than one psychiatrist as well as a substantial discussion with the child's parent or guardian.Unless there are significant adverse effects, medication should be continued for 6 to 12 months if it is believed to help in the remission of depressive symptoms. The pharmacotherapy should be monitored monthly during this continuation phase. Psychotherapy is helpful during this phase to bolster coping skills and to address antecedents, stressors, and interpersonal conflicts that may have contributed to the onset of depression. Medication adherence also may be improved by psychotherapy.Once the patient's symptoms have remitted for 6 to 12 months, the maintenance phase of treatment may last from 1 year to indefinitely. The goals are to facilitate healthy development and to prevent relapse or recurrence. These may be accomplished through monthly or quarterly visits, depending on the severity and chronicity of the present episode, frequency of previous episodes, comorbid disorders, the patient's motivation, and contextual factors (eg, support systems, family stress, and psychopathology).The presence of comorbid conditions often predicts a poorer response to psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatments. These conditions, such as anxiety, disruptive behavior, and substance use disorders, often persist after remission of the depressive symptoms and require targeted treatments. Because of time, cost, or the incompatibility of treatments, addressing all conditions simultaneously may be impossible. Hence, the clinician often must prioritize treatment goals and the sequence of interventions.A depressive disorder may be \"treatment-resistant\" because of an inadequate dosage or duration of medication trial, inadequate duration or \"fit\" with a particular psychotherapy, poor treatment adherence, complicating comorbidity, undetected BD, chronic or severe life events, misdiagnosis, or mistreatment. Psychopharmacologic strategies to address treatment-resistant depression should be applied systematically in conjunction with family education and support and include optimization, switching, augmentation, or combination. Consultation with a psychiatrist always is advised with treatment-resistant cases.If BD is present or is a possibility, a mood-stabilizing agent (eg, lithium carbonate, valproate, or carbamazepine) may be warranted, especially because antidepressants may induce mania in youths at risk for BD. Approximately 30% to 50% of adults experience modest antidepressant effects with mood stabilizers alone. Antidepressants may be useful adjuncts in such treatments. Psychotic depression may require a combination of antidepressants with antipsychotics or ECT. Neuroleptics should be tapered after psychotic symptoms remit due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotic medications may be preferred. However, the long-term effects of these medications have not been studied in youth.Suicide is the third leading cause of death among children and adolescents (National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, 2000). The suicide rate for ages 15 to 24 years is 11.1 per 100,000, which is much higher than the rate for youth between the ages of 5 and 14 years (0.8 per 100,000). The suicide rate for males in the 15- to 19-year age group is markedly higher than that for females (Table 3). Rates differ by racial and ethnic group. African-American youth have lower suicide rates than Caucasian youth, with the lowest adolescent suicide rate being that of African-American females. The highest suicide rate is that of Native American males.Although many youth who report suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide do not become suicide victims, these categories overlap substantially. For instance, having frequent thoughts of suicide is the best predictor of suicide attempts, and most youth who attempt suicide report a history of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, greater severity of reported suicidal thoughts increases the likelihood of a suicide attempt within the next year. Approximately 35% to 45% of adolescents who complete suicide have a positive history of suicide attempt. The prevalences of both self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are higher for adolescent females than for adolescent males (Table 3).Risk factors for completed suicide and suicidal behavior are similar in most respects. There are a few exceptions, however, such as the more specific relationship between availability of firearms and completed suicide. In this section, we review the primary risk factors for completed suicide (Table 4).A history of prior suicidal behavior is the strongest predictor of future suicidal behavior. Nonlethal suicidal gestures or self-inflicted harm, which sometimes are thought to be manipulative or attention-seeking, should not be taken lightly. Youth often can be poor judges of lethality, and what is believed to be a gesture actually may be accompanied by significant suicidal intent. It also may result in substantial physical harm or even suicide because of an error in knowledge or judgment (eg, potential lethality of acetaminophen overdose).Approximately 80% of youth who attempt suicide and 90% of youth suicide victims have histories of identifiable psychiatric or mental disorders. The most common types of psychopathology in these youth are depressive disorders, alcohol or substance abuse, conduct disorder or patterns of aggressive behavior, and anxiety disorders. Increased suicide risk is associated with conditions that often are refractory to treatment or present management problems. These include BD, a chronic depressive disorder comorbid with alcohol or substance abuse, and psychotic presentations.Depressive disorders are linked with increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicides (Table 5). In fact, suicidal ideation and behavior are common and often unrelenting problems among youth who have depressive disorders. Eighty-five percent of depressed youth report significant suicidal ideation, and 32% of depressed youth report one or more suicide attempts prior to adulthood. Retrospective studies have found that about 50% of adolescent suicides involve the consumption of alcohol, which increases impulsivity, impaired judgment, and mood changes.Environmental or family stress, especially a history of neglect or physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, are considered significant risk factors for suicidal behavior. Interpersonal conflict and loss (eg, fights, break-ups, deaths) also are risk factors. Additionally, hopelessness, impulsivity, aggressive behavior, and agitation are psychological characteristics associated with increased risk for suicidal behavior.Gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents are at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Recent general population surveys indicate that approximately 42% of these youth experience suicidal ideation, and 28% have made one or more suicide attempts during the past year. Many of the risk factors in these youth are the same as those for heterosexual youth. Problems such as comorbid substance abuse and depression, however, are more common among youth who have a homosexual orientation. In addition, risk factors such as stigmatization and discrimination are specific to those who face negative attitudes within society.The risk for depression, anxiety, and suicide increases when a youth knows someone who commits suicide. In these situations, intervention aimed at promoting grief and mourning and decreasing guilt, trauma, and social isolation as well as providing psychoeducational counseling aimed at decreasing identification with the suicidal behavior are recommended. Media coverage of suicide may spark suicide contagion. Clinicians are encouraged to advise reporters whenever possible to reduce excessive coverage and to advise parents and educators to discourage exposure of youth to such coverage.Firearms are found more commonly in the homes of suicide victims than in the homes of other youth, including those of psychiatrically hospitalized suicidal youth. The importance of restricting suicidal youth's access to firearms is highlighted by documented associations between more restrictive gun control laws and decreases in suicide rates. Similarly, potentially lethal drugs (such as prescription or over-the-counter sedative drugs) either should be removed from the homes of potentially suicidal youth or monitored closely by parents and guardians.Evidence suggests that if asked directly, adolescents will reveal suicidal preoccupations and previous suicidal behavior. Direct questions should address whether children or adolescents wish they were not alive, if they ever have thought about or tried to hurt themselves intentionally, if they ever have thought about or tried to kill themselves, and if they have or had such a plan in mind. It is important to understand that asking an adolescent about suicidal thoughts or behaviors will not \"put such ideas into his or her head\" or increase the risk for suicidal behavior. Follow-up inquiry regarding the intensity, chronicity, specificity, and recency of such thoughts is advised. Standardized self-report questionnaires, such as the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, may permit the youth to answer without direct verbalization, which can facilitate honesty. If endorsed, critical items related to intent or planning and items suggesting significant suicidality (in terms of chronicity, severity, or frequency) always should be followed up with direct inquiry. Other sources of information include reports from parents, teachers, or others who may have heard suicidal statements or witnessed behaviors such as giving away prized possessions. As with the assessment of depressive disorders, a comprehensive evaluation that incorporates input from the youth and parent or guardian is essential.A psychiatric inpatient or partial hospitalization program may be necessary for patients found to be at elevated suicide risk. Hospital stays generally are brief and emphasize safety, stabilization, evaluation, and aftercare recommendations. Suicide attempts (or plans) that have significant lethality and that include efforts taken to avoid detection indicate serious intent as well as knowledge and planning and should be taken extremely seriously. Furthermore, attention to safety requires consideration of the child's home environment. Parents and caregivers should be advised to remove lethal agents, especially firearms and toxic medications, from the home. Self-injurious behaviors by young children should not be disregarded as accidental. For example, when a 6-year-old child ingests poisonous materials, it may not be accidental. Such behavior should be assessed carefully for associated mood or other disturbance.Verbal or written \"no suicide\" contracts are used in many settings. The patient is asked to agree not to attempt suicide. Furthermore, the patient is asked to agree to contact the clinician, parent, or other responsible adult if he or she feels a suicidal urge or experiences suicidal intent. Perspectives on these contracts have evolved over the past decade, with an increasing emphasis on using the contract as an assessment tool. The contract process may reveal current suicidal intent. It also provides information about the patient's ability to identify, and willingness to turn to, helpful adults. It is useful to review what positive coping steps the youth and parent would take in the event of a suicidal crisis. This offers an opportunity for problem-solving and can counter the tendency of some youth and families to minimize or deny the risk of suicidal behavior. It should be noted, however, that research does not support the conclusion that such contracts prevent suicide; they are not substitutes for comprehensive case management.When caring for a potentially suicidal youth, suicide risk factors, including suicidal thoughts, urges, and behaviors, are monitored at each session. Rules of thumb when working with suicidal youth include: 1) confirming next appointment times at each session, 2) following up on \"no-shows,\" and 3) providing information to the youth and parent or guardian about easily accessible 24-hour emergency services. Comprehensive case management includes psychoeducation and regular patient monitoring with guidelines for responding to crises/changes in functioning.The population of suicidal youth is heterogeneous in terms of primary psychiatric disorder(s), comorbid conditions, personality traits, the presence of complicating psychosocial issues, developmental level, and demographic characteristics. Therefore, the treatment should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of psychopathology and, more generally, suicide risk and protective factors.",

      "abstract": "\"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders\" is a collective term that describes the continuum of disabilities, from mild to severe, accompanying the teratogenic effects of ethanol on the developing fetus. At the severe end of the spectrum is the subset of individuals with growth restriction, a distinctive pattern of facial dysmorphology, and cognitive and/or neurobehavioral effects (fetal alcohol syndrome), and at the mild end of the spectrum are those individuals with neurobehavioral and cognitive deficits who exhibit minimal or no growth or physical stigmata (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading cause of preventable developmental disabilities in the world. They occur much more commonly than previously recognized, with prevalence estimates from prospective school-based studies in the United States of 11.3–50.0 per 1000 children (~1–5%), and rates in special populations, such as the foster care system, as high as 169 per 1000 (~17%). An earlier diagnosis is associated with a better outcome and provides an opportunity to prevent the birth of another affected child in the family. Diagnosis, intervention, and prevention offer some of the greatest challenges to health care providers, families and their communities. Multidisciplinary diagnostic teams are available throughout North America and other parts of the world and can provide accurate and comprehensive assessments and management options for affected individuals. In this chapter, we discuss the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of children and adults with this common range of disabilities.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be viewed as a defect in organization resulting from varying combinations of genetic, organic, intrafamilial and social influences. A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "El sindrome premenstrual (SPM) se caracteriza por una serie de sintomas emocionales y somaticos que se presentan durante la segunda mitad del ciclo menstrual y alcanzan su maximo nivel en el periodo anterior a la menstruacion. Dichos sintomas varian desde la ansiedad e irritabilidad moderadas, hasta la depresion severa. Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

Social anxiety disorder is the most frequent anxiety disorder (10-15%) that occurs in two subtypes--generalized and specific. It is a disorder that occurs during the adolescence and reflects negatively to the quality of life of an individual. Neurobiological basis of this disorder has not been explored yet. The disorder is frequently burdened with comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, depression and substance-related disorders. Only cognitive-behavioral techniques are desirable in the psychotherapeutic treatment of the disorder and the best results are achieved in combination with pharmacotherapy. The medicaments of choice in the treatment of social anxiety disorder are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Anxiolytics should be used only as a supplementary in the acute phase. Treatment of social anxiety disorder should last at least 3 months up to one year.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "abstract": "La maggior parte dei crimini con violenza sulla persona non avviene, come sembrerebbe ad un’analisi superficiale, in modo improvviso, come un «fulmine a ciel sereno», ma segue varie «tappe progressive», non sempre facili da identificare ma indispensabili per una comprensione del crimine e soprattutto per la sua prevenzione. La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc.

      "title": "Clumsy Child",
      "abstract": "It has been estimated that 6% to 7% of school-aged children manifest poor coordination.1 Clinicians will rarely identify the presence of this type of disability from their findings during routine physical and neurologic examinations. What is required is careful observation of the child during performance of fine and gross developmental motor tasks. It is infrequent that parents will express concern to the pediatrician, unless they have clues from nursery school or grade school teachers, coaches, peers, or, occasionally, from the child him- or herself. The child is usually the first one to be aware of motor limitations, especially when he or she is in competition with children of the same age. Unfortunately, the child does not usually verbalize his or her concern but will refrain from participating in competitive motor activities to conceal motor inadequacies. DEFINITION The term \"clumsy child\" refers to a boy or girl who performs fine and/or gross motor tasks in an immature, disorganized, erratic, slow, irregular, or inconsistent fashion. The relevant motor skills are imprecise rather than grossly impaired and the neurologic examination does not reveal significant postural disabilities or involuntary movements. SIGNIFICANCE A pediatrician should not minimize the significance of clumsiness. It is frequently associated with other evidence of cerebral dysfunction, such as cognitive and/or perceptual impairments that may result in learning disabilities.",

      "title": "Perioperative Hearing Impairment",
      "abstract": "PERIOPERATIVE hearing loss is a rarely reported phenomenon. However, it occurs more frequently than most anesthesiologists suspect. Perioperative hearing impairment is often subclinical and may go unnoticed unless audiometry is performed. 1–3It can be conductive or sensorineural, unilateral or bilateral, and transient or permanent. 4–8Hearing loss has been reported following virtually every type of anesthetic technique. The hearing mechanism may be less susceptible to acoustic trauma during general anesthesia, 9but other mechanisms are capable of causing both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses (SNHL) in the perioperative period. The etiologies include mechanical, traumatic, noise-induced, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, nitrous oxide, embolism, pharmacologic, and other miscellaneous causes.The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a snail-shaped structure of 2.75 turns with an uncoiled length of approximately 3 cm (fig. 1). The cochlea is divided into three channels. The two outer channels, the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, contain perilymphatic fluid and communicate at the apex through the helicotrema. The middle channel, the scala media (cochlear duct), contains endolymphatic fluid. In the conventional cross-sectional view of the cochlea (fig. 2), the scala media is triangular in shape. Its upper boundary, the vestibular or Reissner's membrane, attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and to the outer wall of the cochlea, separating it from the scala vestibuli. The lower boundary, the basilar membrane, also attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and the outer wall of the cochlea. The basilar membrane supports the hearing organ, the organ of Corti, and separates the scala media from the scala tympani. The lateral wall of the scala media is the highly vascular stria vascularis. At the base of the cochlea, the perilymph of the scala vestibuli contacts the oval window and the perilymph of the scala tympani contacts the round window (figs. 1 and 3).Arterial blood is supplied to the inner ear by the internal auditory artery, which arises from either the basilar or the inferior anterior cerebellar artery and passes through the internal auditory meatus with cranial nerve VIII. The arterial supply to the cochlea is via end vessels, with no collateral circulation. The afferent special somatic exteroceptive cochlear nerve provides innervation. The peripheral processes arise in the organ of Corti, their cell bodies forming the spiral ganglion of the cochlea in the osseous spiral lamina. The processes converge, traversing the modiolus to form the cochlear nerve, which passes through the internal acoustic meatus with the vestibular nerve. A smaller number of efferent nerve fibers arise from the olivary complexes and terminate axodendritically on the afferent dendrites that innervate the inner hair cells.The cochlear fluid system is made up of two fluids, perilymph and endolymph (fig. 2). Perilymph fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani and has an ionic composition, low in potassium and high in sodium, similar to interstitial fluid and nearly identical to CSF. 10There are two theories regarding its origin: (1) it is filtrate produced by capillaries in the spiral ligament; and (2) it is CSF communicated to cochlea through the cochlear aqueduct, a small channel in the temporal bone near the round window, which connects the scala tympani directly to the subarachnoid space. The endolymphatic fluid is unique to the inner ear. It has a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, similar to intracellular fluid. The stria vascularis is believed to be the source of the unique endolymph ionic composition. Although there is slow longitudinal flow of endolymph, maintenance of the critical ionic environment for the organ of Corti is due to local radial flow between the stria vascularis and nearby cells. Endolymphatic absorption takes place in the endolymphatic sac, a specialized structure of the membranous labyrinth. The endolymphatic sac is located in the subdural space and communicates with the membranous labyrinth via the endolymphatic duct (fig. 1). It is thought to participate in balancing endolymphatic pressures with changes in CSF pressure. Two-way flow through a patent cochlear aqueduct provides relatively rapid perilymphatic pressure equilibration with the CSF. Endolymphatic pressure regulation is considerably slower, being primarily a function of production and absorption. Only minor and temporary pressure adjustments are made by the endolymphatic sac.The organ of Corti, the hearing transduction mechanism, is located in the cochlear duct (scala media). The sensory cells of the organ of Corti are mechanoreceptors with stereocilia projecting from the top of the cells into the endolymph. 11There are two types of hair cells, outer (OHC) and inner (IHC) hair cells (fig. 2). They differ in morphology, microanatomical location, and function. The IHCs and OHCs initiate the transduction process by transforming the acoustic signal into neural activity. Activation of the hair cells causes neurotransmitter release that depolarizes afferent dendrites causing an all-or-none spike discharge in individual auditory nerve fibers. Overlying the organ of Corti is a gelatinous flap, the tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is attached on its medial edge to the spiral limbus and laterally is in contact with the stereocilia of the OHCs. Since the tectorial membrane and basilar membrane have different medial attachment locations, upward or downward displacement of basilar membrane induces shearing displacements of the hairs in contact with the tectorial membrane. These various bending movements of the OHC stereocilia can cause excitation or inhibition. Excitation initiates the transduction of acoustic energy into neural signals. In contrast to OHCs, the stereocilia of the IHC are not embedded in the tectorial membrane but rest in a groove near the undersurface of the tectorial membrane. The IHC do not respond to displacement of the basilar membrane, but they do respond to the velocity of displacement of the basilar membrane. The neural signals initiated by the IHCs and OHCs are transmitted through the acoustic division of cranial nerve VIII ultimately to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.A simplified diagram of the cochlea uncoiled is usually used to describe cochlear mechanics (fig. 3). On the left is the base of the cochlea with the stapes and oval window. Below these structures and adjoining the scala vestibuli is the round window of the scala tympani. In the diagram, the uncoiled cochlea is divided horizontally by a line representing the scala media, Reissner's membrane, the organ of Corti, and the basilar membrane. However, this line, for purposes of understanding cochlear mechanics, can be thought of as simply the basilar membrane. Above the dividing line is the scala vestibuli, and below is the scala tympani. Because of the inertia of the fluid mass and frictional resistance to fluid flow in the narrow channels of the scala, inward or outward motion of the stapes against the oval window causes a pressure wave to travel down the scala; there is no fluid flow. Since the fluids are incompressible within the bony cochlea, the pressure wave traveling down the scala vestibuli causes the basilar membrane to deflect downward toward the scala tympani for positive pressures and upward for negative pressures. The flexible round window compensates for pressure changes transmitted to the scala tympani. For the acute changes caused by pressure waves in the audible frequencies, the connection between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, the helicotrema, functions as though it were closed. The helicotrema is only involved in very slow equalization of pressures between the two scalae.The most important property of the basilar membrane is its ability to separate various frequencies. The compliance of the basilar membrane changes by a factor of greater than 100 from base to apex. At the base, near the oval window, the basilar membrane is narrower and thicker, making it less compliant (fig. 3). It is wider and thinner at the apex, resulting in greater compliance. Since a system's resonant frequency is directly proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to mass, the stiff base responds maximally to high frequencies (> 4,000 Hz), and the compliant apex responds maximally to low frequencies (< 1,000 Hz). In short, the basilar membrane functions as a sharply tuned bandpass filter, performing a spectral analysis on the incoming sound (pressure) waves. The effect is to translate the frequency of incoming sound into distance along the basilar membrane, a frequency-to-place or tonotopical transformation. Therefore, both IHCs and OHCs at a specific point along the basilar membrane respond to a very specific, narrow frequency range. Excited hair cells depolarize specific acoustic neurons, and the information is finally interpreted in the auditory centers.Clinical or subclinical hearing loss following spinal anesthesia or lumbar puncture has been reported frequently(table 1). 4,6–8,12–24Despite many reports, few anesthesiologists appear to be aware of the possibility of this complication. Since there has been no large-scale audiometric study of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia, the precise incidence of clinical or subclinical hearing loss is unknown but may occur more frequently than appreciated. Further, the specific presentation and onset of the hearing deficit after spinal anesthesia can vary widely.The first case of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia 25was reported in 1914. In 1956, Vandam and Dripps 26reported that of 9,277 patients who had spinal anesthesia, 0.4% experienced auditory difficulties, such as impaired hearing, tinnitus, buzzing, or roaring. Few specific data were gathered, and no audiometry of these patients was performed. Michel et al. 27described nine cases of hearing loss following myelography, diagnostic lumbar puncture, and spinal anesthesia. The hearing deficits were almost uniformly in the lower frequencies (125–1,000 Hz). The deficits were bilateral in six of the nine patients. Six of the nine patients had full recoveries in less than 1 month without treatment.In addition to these case reports, there have been several studies of hearing loss related to spinal anesthesia. In one study, 6 of 14 patients had audiometrically detectable mild hearing deficits in the low-frequency range that resolved spontaneously in 1–7 months. 28Walsted et al. 29tested 34 patients with audiometry before and after spinal anesthesia. Most of the patients had a small but significant threshold shift at 500 Hz. However, one patient developed a considerable unilateral hearing loss in the low-frequency range, which persisted until an epidural blood patch was performed. Gultekin et al. 30used pure tone audiometry to test hearing before and after spinal anesthesia for hernia repair. Fourteen patients (32%), despite being unaware of it, had audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing losses. All spinal anesthetics were performed with 22-gauge Quincke needles (needle gauge and design are discussed in the next section), and the authors suggested that hearing loss was less frequent when the anesthetic agent was bupivacaine rather than prilocaine. In 35 patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia (24-gauge Sprotte needle), pure tone audiometry revealed that five patients had developed low-frequency hearing loss on the first postoperative day. 31The deficits were unilateral in three patients and bilateral in the other two. All patients had full recovery without treatment by the fifth postoperative day. In contrast, Finegold et al. 32found no audiometric hearing decrement postoperatively in 44 patients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Half of the patients' spinals were performed with 25-gauge Quincke needles; 24-gauge Sprotte needles were used for the other half. This is the only study of 13 found that failed to show a relationship between spinal anesthesia and hearing loss. Hearing acuity is affected by hormonal changes, 33,34but peripartum changes have not been documented. The explanation for this singular result may be in the study's methodology.In a study of 100 patients undergoing elective urologic procedures under spinal anesthesia, eight patients experienced noticeable hearing impairment. 18Audiometry was performed on three of the patients and revealed a 30-dB loss in the low-frequency range. Hearing deficits resolved within a short time without treatment. In another study of 100 patients undergoing elective general or urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia, 16 had audiometrically documented hearing losses. 3The hearing loss typically affected only the frequencies between 125 and 2,000 Hz. The deficits were usually detected on the second day after the spinal anesthetic and in all cases resolved within 3 days without treatment. The incidence of hearing loss after spinal anesthesia for men under 30 yr of age was compared to that in men over the age of 60. 35Fifty-two percent (13 of 25) of the younger and 16% of the older patients had significant hearing losses (≤ 10 dB) confined to the low-frequency range (125–500 Hz). There was no hearing impairment in the speech frequencies (500–2,000 Hz) and higher frequencies for either group. No patient was aware of a hearing deficit, and no patient developed a post–dural puncture headache (PDPH). In a recent study of hearing loss following spinal versus general anesthesia, there were audiometric losses in both groups, although the spinal group had significantly greater hearing losses, particularly in the low-frequency range. 36Interestingly, in the spinal group, increases in the low-frequency audible threshold were inversely related to the preoperative low-frequency audible threshold.Overall, it appears that 10–50% of patients receiving spinal anesthesia experience an audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing deficit. Less than one fourth of these patients have a clinical, or noticeable, hearing loss.The size of the needle used for dural puncture appears to play a role in postspinal anesthetic hearing impairment. The hearing loss may be a result of CSF leakage even when the CSF loss is insufficient to cause a PDPH. Fog et al. 2found that 13 of 14 patients whose spinal anesthetics were performed with a 22-gauge needle had a 10-dB or greater hearing loss across the audible frequency range with significantly greater losses in the low-frequency range. Only 4 of the 14 patients in whom a 26-gauge needle was used had similar hearing impairment, and none had significant (> 10 dB) losses. When spinal anesthesia was performed with a 26-gauge needle, 37only one of nine patients was found to have a low-frequency hearing loss, which was severe but transient. Interestingly, this patient also experienced a PDPH. In another study of 100 patients, 50 had spinal anesthesia using either a 20- or a 22-gauge needle. Of these, 10% had significant decreases in audiometric values in the 250- to 500-Hz frequency range on the first postoperative day that resolved spontaneously within 5 days. 38In the 50 patients in whom 24- and 25-gauge needles were used, no decrement in audiometric values occurred. Oncel et al. 1used pure tone audiometry at 125 Hz preoperatively and postoperatively to assess hearing loss. Three groups of 15 patients were studied. One group received epidural anesthesia. In the other two groups, spinal anesthesia was performed with either a 22- or 25-gauge needle. No hearing impairments were detected in the epidural group. There was significantly greater hearing loss in the 22-gauge group versus the 25-gauge spinal group. None of the study patients developed a PDPH. The authors suggested that pure tone audiometry may be a more sensitive indicator of CSF leakage than the presence of PDPH.Needle design may also play a role in hearing impairment following lumbar puncture. Using audiometry, Sundberg et al. 39compared the effect of 22-gauge cutting-tip (Quincke) to 22-gauge pencil-point (Whitacre) needles on postspinal hearing loss. A hearing loss of at least 10 dB at two or more frequencies below 1,000 Hz was observed in 6 of 25 (24%) patients in the Quincke group as compared to only 2 of 23 (9%) in the Whitacre group. In addition, of those patients with hearing deficits, the mean hearing level was significantly worse in the Quincke group. This study suggests an association between the design of the spinal needle tip and postoperative hearing dysfunction that is similar to the relationship between the needle types and the incidence of PDPH, implying a similar pathogenesis. Lamberg et al. , 40using audiometric testing, compared hearing losses after a single-shot spinal with a 25-gauge Quincke needle with those following a continuous spinal anesthetic (19-gauge Touhy-type needle and 22-gauge catheter). None of the patients developed a PDPH or were aware of a hearing loss. However, nine (43%) of the single-shot patients and seven (37%) of continuous spinal patients had hearing deficits in excess of 10 dB when tested postoperatively. This result also seems to parallel experience with the cause and incidence of PDPH.In summary, hearing impairment following neuraxial anesthesia seems to be related to the same factors (age, needle gauge, and needle type) that are implicated in CSF leakage and PDPH. 41Two of the studies cited above included a total of 27 patients who received epidural anesthesia. Audiometric testing did not reveal measurable postoperative auditory impairment in any of these patients. On the other hand, the consensus of the studies indicates a consistent rate (10–50%) of SNHL in the low frequencies after lumbar puncture. Also, postspinal hearing impairment resolved without treatment, usually within several days, again suggesting an etiology common with that of PDPH. Interestingly, in two reports, patients who received epidural blood patches for PDPH had simultaneous reversal of their postspinal, low-frequency hearing loss. 4,29Cerebrospinal fluid leakage can cause a decrease in the CSF pressure that may be transmitted to the inner ear. A relative balance in the endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures maintains the normal structural conformation in the inner ear. Disruption of this pressure balance can cause hearing impairment as well as impairment of semicircular canal function. A change in CSF pressure is promptly transmitted through a patent cochlear aqueduct to the inner ear perilymph (fig. 2). 6,42–45A decrease in CSF pressure following a dural puncture and CSF leak would cause a rapid and similar decrease in perilymph pressure. The endolymphatic system, however, responds much more slowly. Endolymphatic pressure–volume adjustments are primarily the result of altered endolymph production at the stria vascularis or altered absorption at the endolymphatic sac. Therefore, an acute drop in CSF pressure could result in endolymphatic pressure sufficiently exceeding that of the perilymph to cause distortions of both Reissner's membrane and the basilar membrane. The consequent disruption in the position of the hair cells results in hearing impairment. 10This mechanism has been postulated in several reports. 3,6,8,46Walsted et al. 47proposed such a mechanism in 1991. Later, in controlled prospective studies of neurosurgical patients and in animal studies, she showed the relationship between CSF loss and low-frequency hearing impairment. 48–52The finding that the degree of hearing impairment is correlated with the size of the spinal needle further supports the theory that postspinal hearing loss and PDPH share a common etiology: leakage of CSF from the subarachnoid space. 1,2Distortion of the basilar membrane and hearing loss could also be caused by acute increases in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph. In a case report, Hardy 53postulated that injection into the epidural space caused an acute increase in CSF pressure that was immediately transmitted through the cochlear aqueduct to the perilymph, thus distorting the basilar membrane and causing an acute low-frequency hypoacusis.Finally, if the mechanism of postspinal hearing loss is the same as for PDPH, several questions arise: why do we not see as many patients with vestibular symptoms; why does not every patient with a severe PDPH experience hearing impairment; and why are some hearing losses unilateral? In response to the first question, not only are the changes in CSF pressure transmitted less rapidly to the vestibular apparatus, but the vestibular apparatus is somewhat less sensitive than the cochlea to perilymph–endolymph pressure imbalances. Further, the hearing deficit may be subclinical, not obvious without audiometric testing. In answer to the second question, as many as 7% of adults have an anatomically obstructed cochlear aqueduct, and as many as 30% have a functionally obstructed aqueduct. 44,45,54For these patients, CSF pressure changes are not transmitted to the perilymph, and, therefore, a severe PDPH could exist without a hearing deficit. This mechanism may also explain the cases of unilateral hearing deficit. In addition, restricted cochlear aqueduct flow and the mechanical compliance of the cochlear windows can limit the stress of CSF pressure changes.The reports cited above indicate that the great majority of hearing deficits that result from lumbar puncture or CSF loss occur in the low frequencies and, in most cases, bilaterally. We propose that this is the result of the physical characteristics of the basilar membrane. At the cochlear base, where higher frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is narrow, thick, and stiff, and therefore resistant to pressure changes that are not in its resonant frequency range (fig. 3). At the cochlear apex, where low frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is much more compliant. Changes in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph can cause significant static displacement of the basilar membrane, disrupting the normal OHC relationship to the tectorial membrane and resulting in low-frequency hearing loss. Hearing loss confined to the low frequencies is unlikely due to CSF pressure–mediated stretch or pressure injury to cranial nerve VIII.It is interesting to note that the low-frequency hearing loss observed in Ménière's syndrome involves a similar mechanism. In Ménière's syndrome, instead of a decrease in perilymphatic pressure relative to endolymphatic pressure, there is an increase in endolymphatic pressure (endolymphatic hydrops). This imbalance in pressures would cause a similar distortion of the basilar membrane with the greatest effect at the cochlear apex and resulting, at least in the early stages, in a hearing loss (low frequency) similar to that which can occur after spinal anesthesia.Presuming that hearing impairment following spinal anesthesia or dural puncture has the same etiology as PDPH, i.e. , loss of CSF or decreased CSF pressure, then the treatment and prognosis should be similar. Figure 4indicates that untreated hearing impairments following dural puncture recover fully greater than 95% of the time. Several authors have noted improvement in auditory symptoms after an epidural blood patch. 4,29,55Lybecker et al. 46prospectively studied the effects of an epidural blood patch on hearing in patients with severe PDPH caused by dural puncture. They performed audiometry at several frequencies 1 h before and 1 h after an epidural blood patch. Twelve of the 16 patients had significant audiometric improvement in hearing. Simply changing position from sitting to supine improved hearing in half of the patients in the absence of the blood patch. This study offers clear evidence of the potential efficacy of epidural blood patch for post–dural puncture hearing loss. In another case report in which conservative measures followed by two epidural blood patches failed to relieve a severe PDPH and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss, an epidural dextran 40 infusion relieved the headache and reversed the hearing loss. 56Rosenberg et al. 57performed an audiometric study of 20 patients undergoing surgery with interscalene brachial plexus block anesthesia. Four of the patients (20%) experienced hearing impairment at various frequencies on the side of the block. The low frequencies (250–500 Hz) were affected in only one patient who also had hearing threshold decrements on the opposite side of 15–20 dB measured in the 6,000- to 10,000-Hz range (table 2). Farrell et al. 58described four patients with sudden permanent deafness following anesthesia for dental surgery. Anesthesia for three of the patients was local infiltration or nerve block, and the fourth had general anesthesia. The patient who had general anesthesia had bilateral SNHL, while the three other patients had ipsilateral SNHL. Similarly, Shenkman et al. 59reported a case in which permanent neurologic symptoms, ipsilateral hearing impairment, a facial nerve palsy, and ataxia occurred following an inferior alveolar nerve block. These findings are summarized in table 2.Within 24 h after the interscalene blocks, all four of the patients had spontaneous resolution of their hearing deficits. 57The authors postulated that the mechanism of hearing loss involved an effect due to sympathetic blockade. Vasodilation caused by the sympathetic block may have developed, resulting in edema of the mucosal membranes of both the Eustachian tube and the middle ear and producing a hearing decrement on that side. The hearing loss resolved within 24 h without treatment in all four patients.With regard to the hearing deficits following dental procedures, the authors 58,59could not identify a specific etiology for any of the cases. Several possibilities were considered. Noise-induced hearing loss from dental drills is known to result in temporary, noise-induced, bilateral hearing deficits. 60Dental extractions are known to cause microemboli that could reach the cochlear vasculature and cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment. 58Vasoconstrictors are usually used with local anesthesia for dental procedures. Intravascular injection could cause vasospasm of the cochlear division of the internal auditory artery. 58Finally, nociceptive afferents or autonomic nerve fibers could initiate a reflex vasoconstriction of critical vessels to the hearing structures. Hearing loss during dental procedures appears to be quite rare and usually temporary.Hearing impairment after general anesthesia for non–cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is rare. Our review of the English language literature through 2001 revealed only 35 reported (29 documented audiometrically) cases of hearing loss after general anesthesia (table 3).Evan et al. 61reported three cases of SNHL following general anesthesia; one patient recovered, and the other two sustained permanent hearing loss. The authors were unable to elucidate the etiology in any of the patients. Cox and Sargent 62reported three cases of hearing loss following nonotologic surgery. Two patients had permanent, profound unilateral hearing loss, and one patient had moderate bilateral hearing loss. Velazquez 63described a case of acute unilateral hearing deficit following abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Other authors have described bilateral hearing impairment immediately following minor abdominal surgeries. 64,65It should also be noted that some patients who receive general anesthesia come to the operating room from an intensive care unit having already sustained an unrecognized hearing loss. Halpern et al. 66have discussed the myriad causes of hearing loss in the critical care setting.Although the etiology of hearing loss associated with general anesthesia often cannot be ascertained, there are a number of potential etiologies: changes in middle ear pressure, vascular pathology, CSF pressure changes, embolism, ototoxic drugs, and other miscellaneous causes.Excessive or sudden changes in middle ear pressure can disrupt the tympanic membrane, the round window, and the conducting structures. Excessive middle ear pressure can cause the round window to rupture, resulting in significant hearing loss. 67,68This type of injury has been described as occurring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 69Two patients who were successfully resuscitated developed partial deafness, one from disarticulation of the incomalleal joint and the other from an oval window perilymph fistula. It was postulated that during vigorous mask ventilation, excessive pressure was suddenly transmitted through the Eustachian tube causing the middle ear injuries.Nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthesia was shown in the late 1960s to be capable of causing oscillations of middle ear pressures that could result in tympanic perforation and cause hearing loss. 70,71Depending on the uptake or elimination phase, N2O can displace tympanic membrane grafts outward or inward and disrupt reconstructed middle ear conducting structures. Segal et al. 72described a case of labyrinthine membrane rupture and sustained SNHL due to elevated intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. The degree of intratympanic pressure fluctuation is a function of N2O concentration and its rate of change. Several cases of middle ear injury have been described as resulting from sudden changes in intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. 73–77Further, the patency of the Eustachian tube may play a role in potential injury during N2O anesthesia. During N2O elimination, Eustachian tube obstruction can result in significant negative middle ear pressure and tympanic perforation. 78A vascular pathogenesis is another possible mechanism for hearing impairment after general anesthesia.

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

      "title": "Tremor‐Predominant Fragile X‐Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome in a Female",
      "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects fragile X (FMR1) gene premutation carriers in late life (an abnormally large allele that is not associated with clinical symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, but can expand into full mutation when transmitted to offspring). The prevalence in male carriers over 50 years is approximately 40%.1 In female carriers (approximately 1 in 260), the prevalence has not been as extensively studied, but may be as low as 8% over age 40.2 We present the case of a 65-year-old female with a 6-year history of bilateral hand tremor. The symptoms slowly progressed. Currently, she has tremor when holding a cup and has mild tremor when writing. She has no other issues with activities of daily living. She has no cognitive complaints, loss of dexterity or coordination, or other tremor localizations. In addition, she describes long-standing unsteadiness when walking. On physical examination, she has bilateral mild postural and moderate intention tremor of both arms. Mild tremor at rest in her left hand is also observed. Tone, power, and reflexes are normal. She has no limb ataxia, rigidity, or bradykinesia. During walking, she has mild reduced arm swing and her tandem gait is slightly unsteady. Her brain MRI shows mild atrophy, predominantly in the cerebellum, with no evidence of middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) sign or corpus callosum splenium hyperintensity. Her father had arm tremor for many years. Her son has Fragile X syndrome. The patient has an FMR1 premutation (97 repeats), and her symptoms are compatible with FXTAS. Since the original description of FXTAS, there have been many reports and series describing phenotypic differences between males and females. In males, FXTAS is usually characterized by progressive tremor and gait ataxia. Other common features are parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, and depression. Cognitive decline is a highly prevalent and disabling symptom. Brain MRI usually shows atrophy of the cerebrum, cerebellar cortex, corpus callosum and pons, and white matter increased T2 signal intensity. The MCP sign (middle cerebellar peduncles hyperintense signal in T2) is observed in approximately 60% of the cases.1, 2, 4 In contrast, in females with FXTAS, tremor is rarely the initial presentation and is usually a later feature (prevalence of tremor range: 12%–75%) and ataxia is typically milder than in males. As in males, the neurophysiological characteristics of tremor in women with FXTAS have not been well studied. In addition, there are few detailed descriptions of the clinical features of tremor in FXTAS. Parkinsonism can be prominent as the disease progresses. Cognitive impairment is less commonly reported and leads to minor disability. Depression is a common feature (approximately 40%), and, interestingly, it was suggested that women with FXTAS show predisposition to psychogenic disorders. In female premutation carriers, primary ovarian dysfunction (20%), sensory loss (45%), chronic pain (26%), thyroid disorders (50%), and fibromyalgia are also common features. MRI studies showed MCP in only 13% of females.1-5 In our patient, the clinical presentation with a slowly progressive intention tremor and mild gait disturbance could potentially lead to the misdiagnosis of essential tremor. The early development of mild ataxia (rather than later onset that may be more common in essential tremor) was a clue to the diagnosis. In her case, the family history of Fragile X syndrome also clearly oriented the diagnosis; however, FXTAS should also be considered in the absence of a family history of mental retardation, autism, or learning disorders.

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

      "title": "Trichotillomania: Its Classification and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder. The following article brings to light that this disorder man not be as rare as some clinicians think. The following discussion delineates Trichotillomania in terms of its descriptive characteristics, onset and course, associated disorders, relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and treatment. Research indicates a combination of psychopharmacology and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the choice of treatment for this disorder. Following the content discussion of Trichotillomania is a transcript of an interview with one of the authors (K. A.) who was previously diagnosed with Trichotillomania. INTRODUCTION Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder and is defined by the following five criteria listed in the DSM-IV (1994): a) recurrent pulling of one's hair resulting in noticeable hair loss, b) an increasing sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior, c) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair, d) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition, e) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. (p. 621) This article seeks to provide an overview of Trichotillomania in terms of its history and descriptive characteristics, onset and course of illness, associated disorders, its relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and the treatment of choice for Trichotillomania. HISTORY AND DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS History In 1889 a French dermatologist, Hallopeau, described a man who pulled out his hair in large amounts (Swedo, 1993). Hallopeau used the term trichotillomania to describe this behavior. Before Hallopeau's encounter with his client, references to hair-pulling had already been documented. In 1779, Baudament reported on a 16-year-old boy who pulled out his hair and actually ate it. Eventually, this ingestion of hair led to gastrointestinal problems because the boy developed hair balls in his stomach (Christenson & Mackenzie, 1994). Once thought to be rare, this disorder is far from uncommon. It has been estimated that approximately eight million Americans are afflicted with this disorder (Azrin & Nunn, 1978). A survey conducted by Rothbaum, Shaw, Morris, and Ninan (1993) revealed that of the 490 college freshman respondents, 10% reported compulsive hair-pulling. Despite these statistics, the literature is very scarce regarding this disorder. Characteristics Trichotillomania is predominately found in the female population. Christenson, Mackenzie, and Mitchell (1991) found that 93% of 60 adult chronic hair-pullers were women. Likewise, Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that 70% of 43 sampled children, adolescents, and adults who were chronic hair-pullers were female. Christenson and Mackenzie (1994) found a more equal sex ratio in children under the age of six. Hair-pulling can occur from many body locations. A study done by Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that the most common area from which hair is pulled is the scalp, followed by eyelashes, eyebrows, pubis, body (arm/leg), and face (beard). Most individuals pluck hair from at least two sites, with sites varying over time. Those diagnosed with this disorder typically think that the hair that is pulled is somehow different from other hair. For example, chronic hair-pullers may pluck kinky or course hair so that they may feel right about their hair, thus reducing anxiety (Swedo & Rapoport, 1991.). After the hair is pulled, other ritualistic acts can follow. For instance, some individuals will play with or twirl their extracted hair, while others may brush it against their cheeks or lips. Some individuals will even go as far as ingesting their hair (trichophagia), possibly leading to gastrointestinal difficulties or even death (Swedo & Leonard, 1992). …",

      "abstract": "Objetivo: A depressão pode ser uma complicação psiquiátrica do acidente vascular encefálico (AVE), contudo tal relação precisa ser mais bem elucidada. Assim, objetivou-se revisar a relação entre AVE e o desenvolvimento de depressão maior. Metodologia: Foram utilizadas as bases de dados PubMed, Cochrane e EMBASE, com os descritores “depression” ou “mood” e “stroke” ou “cerebrovascular”, sendo selecionados 37 artigos. Foram excluídas publicações anteriores ao ano de 2000. Resultados e Discussão: A depressão é a alteração psiquiátrica mais associada ao AVE, sendo mais incidente de 3-6 meses pós-AVE: a cada 3 pacientes que sofrem AVE, 1 desenvolve depressão. O quadro está relacionado a características sociais e clínicas individuais (sexo, apoio familiar recebido, déficit de função e grau de dependência, extensão e localização do dano e presença de outras alterações vasculares), sendo a incapacidade física desencadeada pelo evento agudo o fator de risco mais relevante para o desenvolvimento do quadro. Mesmo diante disso, os resultados dos estudos sobre a depressão pós-AVE são discordantes, posto que existe a dificuldade em estabelecer e padronizar diagnóstico. Ainda que exista essa barreira, estudos sugerem que o desenvolvimento de depressão está relacionado à área específica do cérebro acometida no AVE. A associação mais evidente está relacionada aos eventos que atingem o circuito pré-frontosubcortical, sobretudo do hemisfério esquerdo. Em contrapartida, outros estudos afirmam que o desenvolvimento de depressão pós-AVE se relaciona com a extensão do dano e não com a área neuronal acometida. Conclusão: Embora a relação entre AVE e o desenvolvimento de depressão precise ser elucidada é inegável que existe uma relação entre ambas. É necessário mais conhecimento para firmar os fatores de risco e os desfechos associados e, por conseguinte, entender a etiologia e as implicações desta condição na recuperação neurológica dos pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Die postpartalen psychischen Störungen lassen sich im Wesentlichen drei Gruppen zuordnen: Dem so genannten \"Baby Blues\", der Wochenbettdepression und der Wochenbettpsychose. Der etwa 3 - 5 Tage nach Entbindung auftretende Baby Blues kommt nach 50 - 70 % aller Geburten vor und klingt nach etwa einer Woche ohne weitere Therapie meist folgenlos ab. Allerdings entwickeln 20 - 30 % dieser Frauen im weiteren Wochenbettverlauf eine Depression, weshalb bei über 2 Wochen post partum persistierenden Bluessymptomen eine genauere Exploration hinsichtlich einer Depression zu empfehlen ist. Wochenbettdepressionen betreffen 10 - 15 % aller Entbundenen; sie treten meist mehrere Wochen bis Monate nach Entbindung in Form einer depressiven Verstimmung mit Schlafstörungen, Ängstlichkeit, Antriebsmangel, Interessenverlust und Schuldgefühlen bis hin zu Selbstmordgedanken auf. Um sie nicht als Babyblues fehlzudeuten, sind gezielte Fragen nach der Stimmungslage der jungen Mutter bei der Untersuchung 6 Wochen post partum, ggfs. unter Anwendung der Edinburgh-Skala zu empfehlen. Patientinnen mit bekannten Risikofaktoren für die Entwicklung einer Wochenbettdepression (Z.n. Wochenbettdepression oder Wochenbettpsychose, depressive Erkrankung, Angsterkrankung, bipolare Erkrankung) bedürfen einer engmaschigen Überwachung und ggfs. einer prophylaktischen Behandlung in Kooperation mit dem Psychiater. Leichtere Formen der Wochenbettdepression sind ambulant mit psychotherapeutischen und soziotherapeutischen Maßnahmen meist gut zu behandeln. Bei schwereren Verläufen sind Antidepressiva (selektive Serotoninwiederaufnahmehemmer (SSRI) oder bestimmte Trizyklika) indiziert. Postpartale Angst- und Zwangsstörungen sprechen gut auf Psychotherapie an; bei Angsterkrankungen werden außerdem Benzodiazepine, bei Zwangserkrankungen SSRI empfohlen. Wochenbettpsychosen (ca. 0,1 - 0,2 %) treten vermehrt bei bekannter bipolarer oder schizoaffektiver Störung bzw. bei Z.n. Wochenbettpsychose auf. Sie müssen vor allem wegen der Gefahr des erweiterten Suizids stationär behandelt werden; idealerweise erfolgt dies in interdisziplinären Mutter-Kind-Einheiten.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

Similarly confusing may be the temporary cessation of menstruation, consequent on lingering suppression of pituitaryovarian function after discontinuance of estrogen intake. The uncertainty about pregnancy may be worrisome. Much more serious is the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function that lingers after withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy. Without the support of exogenous corticosteroids, the patient is unable to cope with stress, eg, trauma or infection.

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Numerous psychopathological syndromes have been attributed to posttraumatic stress, both at the time of the trauma and many years later. To date, however, there is little literature on pseudodementia as a delayed traumatic stress response. The authors present a case history of a 50‐year‐old woman who developed severe cognitive impairment following retrieval of previously forgotten memories of childhood sexual abuse. Her cognitive condition deteriorated rapidly and dramatically. Neuropsychological assessment and clinical presentation led to a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (vs. corticobasal degeneration). Detailed neurologic and medical evaluations could not identify any underlying physical cause. Her condition progressively worsened over 9 months, at which point memantine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist, was begun. The patient regained full functioning over the next year. Although an organic cause could not be ruled out, it was likely that recovery of traumatic memories was contributory to the patient's condition, as ongoing psychotherapy had begun 1 year into the course. If additional cases with similar presentations are reported, such cases would corroborate the notion that persistent, severe, and reversible cognitive impairment constitutes a previously unrecognized and atypical posttraumatic response.",

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

Anxiety sensitivityAnxiety sensitivity (AS) refers to individual differences in the fear of anxietyrelated sensations and the expectation that such sensations can have harmful consequences (Reiss, 1997;Reiss & McNally, 1985).Just as some people are afraid of spiders, some individuals fear the sensations that accompany anxiety.This construct AS can be measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (Peterson & Reiss, 1992;Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986).AS has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, specifically PD (Reiss, 1991).Besides AS, trait anxiety is also regarded as a vulnerability factor for the de- Chapter 2Reactivity to a 35% CO2 challenge in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with panic disorder Background: The effects of a 35% CO2 challenge were examined in healthy firstdegree relatives of panic disorder patients and in healthy control subjects matched for age and gender.Methods: One single inhalation of a 35% CO2 / 65% O2 challenge was administered to 50 first-degree relatives of panic disorder patients and 50 control subjects.Results: The first-degree relatives were more reactive to the 35% CO2 challenge than the control subjects.Conclusions: These findings indicate that being a member of a family with a panic disorder patient is, in itself, an important factor in CO2 hypersensitivity among subjects who have never experienced a panic attack.Both panic disorder patients and their first-degree relatives have a tendency to be more reactive to the CO2 challenge.van Beek, N., & Griez, E.

Compared to the hysterical structure, schizoids more frequently show the following characteristics: they are men and have as their secondary component a mixed character structure, an earlier age of onset, a longer duration of illness but earlier referral for psychotherapy. They suffer mainly from psychic symptoms--depressive states and contact difficulties as the indicating signs. Further complaints are defective concentration, feelings of apprehension and difficulty in working, also bulimia and the inability to breathe deeply. They were mostly born between 1940 and 1959. Their relatives suffered from psychiatric disorders. Compared to the schizoids, hysterically structured individuals are almost exclusively women, their second most important structural component being obsessive-compulsive. They develop their illness later, have it for a shorter time and are referred for psychotherapy later. Their indicating signs manifest themselves more often somatically, less frequently as anxiety states or phobias. The symptoms occur simultaneously in several organ systems, particularly the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract and the musculoskeletal system. Common symptoms are dyspnea and/or hyperventilation tetany, nausea, weight gain, frigidity and fluor as well as crying fits. They formerly suffered from gynecological disorders and had to undergo operations. They were mainly born between 1920 and 1939. Their relatives had cardiac disorders and their symptoms were identical or similar to those of their father.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Laboratory investigations, whilst not essential to the diagnosis of seizures or of epilepsy, can be fundamental to determining the cause and guiding management. Over 50% of first seizures have an acute symptomatic cause, including a range of metabolic, toxic or infectious cause. The same triggers can precipitate status epilepticus, either de novo or as part of a deterioration in control in individuals with established epilepsy. Some, such as hypoglycaemia or severe hyponatraemia, can be fatal without prompt identification and treatment. Failure to identify seizures associated with recreational drug or alcohol misuse can lead to inappropriate AED treatment, as well as a missed opportunity for more appropriate intervention. In individuals with established epilepsy on treatment, some laboratory monitoring is desirable at least occasionally, in particular, in relation to bone health, as well as in situations where changes in AED clearance or metabolism are likely (extremes of age, pregnancy, comorbid disorders of renal or hepatic function). For any clinician managing people with epilepsy, awareness of the commoner derangements associated with individual AEDs is essential to guide practice. In this article, we review indications for tests on blood, urine and/or cerebrospinal fluid in patients presenting with new‐onset seizures and status epilepticus and in people with established epilepsy presenting acutely or as part of planned monitoring. Important, but rare, neurometabolic and genetic disorders associated with epilepsy are also mentioned.",

Le plus grand nombre avaient été diagnostiqués “non différenciés”, quelques-uns portaient l'étiquette “familiale”. Tous les malades choisis pour cette étude présentaient des signes d'immaturité physique; tous révélaient des symptômes, en diverses combinaisons, des états endocriniens suivants:1. Retard de la croissance et du poids2. Défaut de fonction thyroïde3. Défaut de fonction du cortex surrénal4. Retard dans le développement des gonades.Le diagnostic de défaut de fonctionnement de l'hypophyse antérieure était évident.Les sujets ont été traités aux hormones thyroïdienne ou gonadotrophique ou une combinaison des deux vu qu'elles ont toutes deux la réputation d'influer directement sur les états mentaux. On n'a pas utilisé l'hormone de la croissance.Quatre anamnèses sont données pour illustrer les constatations. Dans trois cas, les sujets présentaient un défaut marqué du fonctionnement des gonades. Après un traitement aux hormones gonado-trophiques chorioniques, un sujet a présenté une hausse marquée du taux d'excrétion par 24 heures des 17-cétostéroïdes et en même temps, une amélioration marquée dans l'échelle des cotes de comportement. Lorsqu'on a discontinué temporaitement le traitement, les cotes ont baissé de nouveau. Après reprise du traitement, les testicules augmentèrent de volume et le canal inguinal se ferma. Les points obtenus par le deuxième malade sur l'échelle des cotes au début du traitement montrait une chute initiale ressemblant à la période d'agitation qui se produit au cours de la puberté physiologique chez les garçons. Le traitement a été discontinué et il s'est produit un déclin du taux des 17-cétostéroïdes et de l'âge mental. Le troisième sujet avait un faible taux de métabolisme basal. On lui a donné de la thyroïde desséchée; durant le traitement, le taux de métabolisme basai ne s'est élevé qu'une fois jusqu'à la normale; le taux d'excrétion par 24 heures n'a pas changé, mais le sujet a vu son état mental s'améliorer. Le quatrième sujet souffrait d'un défaut de fonctionnement des gonades et de la thyroïde, présentait de petits testicules et un faible taux de métabolisme basai. Après le traitement à l'hormone gonadothrophique, le sujet a fait peu de progrès sauf que sa cote de comportement a monté. Le traitement aux hormones n'a pas influé sur le défaut de fonctionnement de la thyroïde. Après l'institution du traitement à la thyroïde, le taux d'excrétion et celui des corticoïdes se mit à fluctuer, le taux de métabolisme basai monta; la cote de comportement se mit à grimper; le Q.I. resta le même. La taille du sujet augmenta de 4 pouces.Les mongoloïdes étudiés ne souffraient pas de déficience thyroïdienne. On estime que le défaut de fonctionnement des gonades chez les mongoloïdes peut être influencé par des états matériels des gonades au moment de la conception ou durant la grossesse.",

      "title": "Convulsive Status Epilepticus in Infants and Children",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Two hundred and thirty‐nine cases of status epilepticus in children 0–15 years old have been studied. Generalized tonic‐clonic and unilateral clonic convulsions constituted the bulk of cases. Status is mostly observed in young infants since 37% of all cases occurred in the first year, 73% in the first 3 years and 85% before 5 years of age. In only 23% of the patients did brief convulsions precede the episode of status epilepticus. Conversely seizures were noticed after status in almost three quarters of patients followed for one year or more. One half of our cases were apparently due to organic brain damage, either acute or chronic, the remaining half had no recognized etiological factors. More than half of these cryptogenic cases were related to non‐specific febrile episodes. The prognosis of children's status epilepticus is grave, mental or neurological residua or both being present in at least 57% of our patients. Approximately one half of these children had had normal development prior to their bout of convulsions. Gross brain damage was the main cause of status below 6 months of age, whereas cryptogenic convulsions predominated during the second year. Most of these cases were associated with fever. It is suggested that status epilepticus is capable of causing brain damage whatever its cause and that many cryptogenic episodes of febrile status are but the most severe cases in the spectrum of febrile convulsions. RÉSUMÉ Deux cents trente‐neuf cas d'état de mal épileptique chez l'enfant de 0–15 ans ont étéétudiées. Les crises généralisées tonico‐cloniques et les crises cloniques unilatérales sont la majorité. L'état de mal est surtout fréquent chez l'enfant jeune, 37% des cas survenant dans la premiére année, 73% avant trois ans et 85% avant cinq ans. L'état de mal n'a été précédé de convulsions courtes que dans 23% des cas. A l'inverse des crises aprés l'état de mal ont ete notées chez prés de trois quarts des malades suivis un an ou plus. La moitié de nos cas semble due à une atteinte cérebrale organique, aigüe ou chronique, l'autre moitié de ces états n'ayant pas de cause reconnue. Plus de la moitié de ces états de mal cryptogenétiqués étaient en relation avec des infections banales n'intéressant pas primitivement le cerveau. Le pronostic de l'état de mal épileptique de l'enfant est grave, puisque des séquelles mentales ou neurologiques étaient présentes chez 57% de nos enfants. Chez à peu prés la moitié de ceux‐ci le développement neuro‐psychique avait été normal jusqu'à l'état de mal. Avant l'âge de 6 mois les lésions organiques sont la cause commune des états de mal alors que les formes idiopathiques sont prédominates dans la seconde anneé, le plus souvent en association avec de la fiévre. l'état de mal épileptique semble capable á lui seul de créer des lésions cérébrates définitives quelle que soit sa cause. Nombre d'états de mal fébriles ne seraient que la forme extrême des convulsions fébriles.",

      "abstract": "Background: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) are usually at an initial stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, some patients with aMCI do not present biomarkers of amyloid pathology characteristic of AD. The significance of amyloid-negative aMCI is not presently clear. Objective: To know the etiology and prognosis of amyloid-negative aMCI. Methods: Patients who fulfilled criteria for aMCI and were amyloid negative were selected from a large cohort of non-demented patients with cognitive complaints and were followed with clinical and neuropsychological assessments. Results: Few amyloid-negative aMCI had evidence of neurodegeneration at the baseline, as reflected in cerebrospinal fluid elevated tau protein levels. About half of the patients remained essentially stable for long periods of time. Others manifested a psychiatric disorder that was not apparent at baseline, namely major depression or bipolar disorder. Remarkably, about a quarter of patients developed neurodegenerative disorders other than AD, mostly frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body disease. Conclusion: Amyloid-negative aMCI is a heterogeneous condition. Many patients remain clinically stable, but others may later manifest psychiatric conditions or evolve to neurodegenerative disorders. Prudence is needed when communicating to the patient and family the results of biomarkers, and clinical follow-up should be advised.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.6% among U.S. adults, yet often goes unrecognized. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food larger than most people would eat in a similar amount of time under similar circumstances and a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode), occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months, and associated with marked distress. It can affect both men and women, regardless if they are at normal weight, overweight, or obese, and regardless of their ethnic or racial group. Psychiatric comorbidities are very common, with 79% of adults with BED also experiencing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, or substance use disorders; almost 50% of persons with BED have ≥ 3 psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple neurobiological explanations have been proffered for BED, including dysregulation in reward center and impulse control circuitry, with potentially related disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission and endogenous μ-opioid signaling. Additionally, there is interplay between genetic influences and environmental stressors. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral interventions have been recommended as first line and are supported by meta-analytic reviews. Unfortunately, routine medication treatments for anxiety and depression do not necessarily ameliorate the symptoms of BED; however, at present, there is one approved agent for the treatment of moderate to severe BED-lisdexamfetamine, a stimulant that was originally approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

Although depression itself, apart from medication, is generally believed to be associated with sexual dysfunction, the few existing studies report wide discrepancies with regard to frequency, gender, and quality of sexual dysfunction. Loss of libido is frequently and consistently associated with major depression. Moreover, sexual dysfunction secondary to depression or other factors is often mistaken for that caused by antidepressant medication. Although antidepressants have long been associated with sexual dysfunction, the precise nature and magnitude of sexual side effects have not been fully appreciated.

      "title": "Erectile dysfunction, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia are more common among acquired premature ejaculation patients in contrast to other premature ejaculation syndromes",
      "abstract": "Time (of the intravaginal ejaculatory latency, or IELT); control (of the ejaculation); distress (perceived by the patient and the partner): These are the dimensions well recognized as being intrinsically connected, and affected, in premature ejaculation (PE) patients.1 However, it is unanimously accepted that PE is a tri- or multidimensional disorder (considering the impairment of the orgasm2), meaning that other relevant psychosexological correlates characterize the condition and contribute to its pathophysiology and clinical presentation. This finding significantly emerges also from the recent and interesting paper \"erectile dysfunction, anxiety, perceived stress and Insomnia are more common among acquired premature ejaculation patients compared to other premature ejaculation syndromes\" by Demirci et al. In particular, erectile dysfunction (ED) severity was found to be high in patients with acquired PE (APE) (80.0%) and moderate in lifelong PE (LPE) (38.5%), while the greatest number of patients with no ED were found in the type subgroup previously (although not consistently) defined in the past as \"subjective\" PE (SPE in the article, a now misleading acronym, being used for the well-structured taxonomic category of subclinical premature ejaculation, having major and minor diagnostic criteria: SPE3) (75.0%). However, looking at the other side of the coin, 11 of 18 of such SPE patients (thus more than 50%) were found to have moderate or severe ED too. If, on the one hand, it is bizarre to notice that such patients who thought they have ejaculated early despite a normal time (hence labelled as subjective PE) and, for this reason, in contrast to \"true\" PE patients (i.e., LPE and APE) end up having ED too, on the other hand (and looking from a more realistic perspective) such data are not surprising at all. Indeed, in clinical practice, 50% of patients with PE also report ED, and the correlation between erectile and ejaculatory function is so well-known that recently a new taxonomic entity called \"loss of control of erection and ejaculation\" has been proposed,3 to identify the condition of impaired ability to control at the same time erectile and ejaculatory function which so frequently occurs among patients,4 and so frequently it is neither diagnosed nor treated. In fact, the decision not to treat a patient that complains about PE because he thinks to have ejaculated early despite a normal time, can forecast potential risks in clinical management. Indeed, often such patients, despite showing a subnormal IELT, may still face a relevant lack of control in the ejaculation process (and significant perceived distress). ED can often be superimposed on these patients, who instinctively reduce their level of excitement in an attempt to control their ejaculation. Thereby, considering them as having a subjective disorder, simply reassuring rather than treating them, may worsen the situation, harbouring, bona fide, the risk of converting a situation of subclinical PE into an overt PE. Among the patients analyzed by Demirci et al., only four of 18 of subjective PE reported good or very good ejaculatory control. Moreover, the median value of their premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT), is 11, which yet accounts for a PE diagnosis. Indeed, PEDT, the most important psychometric test aiding the diagnosis of PE, has precisely two items dealing with control, two for distress, and one only for time. Interestingly, the Patient Reported Outcomes of this diagnostic tool are now validated for the autoerotic setting, enlarging the diagnostic possibilities of PE diagnosis to single people.5 More emphasis is given to the lack of control and distress, rather than the IELT, for defining what PE is. This has been similarly stated by the latest guidelines of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine, which recommended considering the aspects of the tri-dimensional definition of PE in order of clinical importance.6 Hierarchically, loss of control over ejaculation is clinically more relevant than the distress provoked in the patient or the partner, and even more than short IELT.7 We found another interesting finding in the Demirci et al.'s article. The Colleagues nicely found, by well-validated psychometric tools, that PE symptoms are associated with worse sleep quality and erectile function. Future research should concentrate on the levels of testosterone, robustly related to nocturnal apneas and ED, also in PE, which presents significantly higher levels of T with respect to other sexual dysfunctions such as ED.8 Altogether, this article reminds us once more that time is only one of the main criteria for establishing a diagnosis of PE and that the clinical spectrum of PE is quite more complex. We thereby encourage, when dealing with PE patients both in the research and in the clinical practice, to consider the sexual and non-sexual comorbidities,9 as well all the lights and shades of the current definitions and to realistically appraise the whole clinical spectrum of PE patients, very far from being only a matter of (short) time.10",

      "title": "The dexamethasone suppression test: an overview of its current status in psychiatry. The APA Task Force on Laboratory Tests in Psychiatry",
      "abstract": "The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) has had unprecedented evaluation among biological tests proposed for clinical use in psychiatry. It is hypothesized to reflect pathophysiologic changes at the CNS level. The sensitivity of the DST (rate of a positive outcome, or nonsuppression of cortisol) in major depression is modest (about 40%-50%) but is higher (about 60%-70%) in very severe, especially psychotic, affective disorders, including major depression with psychotic as well as melancholic features, mania, and schizoaffective disorder. The specificity (true negative outcome) of the DST in normal control subjects is above 90%, but it varies from less than 70% to more than 90% in psychiatric conditions that often need to be separated from major affective disorders. In dementia the specificity is even lower. In addition, a number of medical conditions, including severe weight loss and use of alcohol and certain other drugs (barbiturates, anticonvulsants, and others), can produce false positive results. Positive initial DST status in major depression does not add significantly to the likelihood of antidepressant response, and a negative test is not an indication for withholding antidepressant treatment. Some recent data suggest that DST-positive depressions (cortisol nonsuppression) are less likely than DST-negative cases (cortisol suppression) to respond to a placebo. If this is confirmed, it would increase the real magnitude of the difference in treatment response between DST-positive and DST-negative depressed patients. Failure to convert to normal suppression of cortisol with apparent recovery from depression suggests an increased risk for relapse into depression or suicidal behavior. Although the clinical utility of the DST as currently understood is limited, in certain specific situations its thoughtful use may aid clinical decision making. The association of an abnormal test result with major affective disorders encourages continued research on the DST.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency that, despite recent improvements in the diagnosis and treatment, continues to be associated with a significant mortality, 3% in children and 22% in adults. It is a serious threat to life and is associated with a significant health care cost. A recent definition describes SE as more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity, or two or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. It has variable clinical presentation and may be general, partial convulsive or non-convulsive. SE complications the clinical management of approximately 10% of patients with epilepsy, and 75% of patients who develop SE do not have prior epilepsy. Patients with symptomatic seizures are more likely to experience SE. There is a consensus that a patient with SE needs to be treated as quickly as possible in order to prevent serious neurological damage. The treatment of SE can be divided in two steps: prehospital and hospital. Prehospital management of SE starts immediately on the spot were the patient is found, and very often-complete recovery depends on first aid. It is necessary in order to priority, to maintain vital functions, to treat the cause of seizures, to initiate rapid glucose determination and correction, to provide prophylaxis against further seizures, and to monitor the situation. Establish IV access ideally in large vein, because IV administration is the preferred route for anticonvulsants in SE. Benzodiazepines remain the mainstay of initial drug therapy for acute seizures. Diazepam administered IV or per rectum, has been and still is considered as one of the drugs of choice for the first line management of SE, especially in prehospital setting.",

      "title": "Conduct Disorders in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Conduct disorder is the most prevalent psychopathologic condition of childhood. It is characterized by a persistent and repetitive pattern of aggressive, noncompliant, intrusive, and poorly self-controlled behaviors that violate either the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.1 These behaviors have a significant impact on the daily functioning of the child or adolescent and on the ability of parents and other adults to manage them. The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

Most cases are reported in males, Koro syndrome in females is very rare. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old woman presented with complaints that the skin over the vagina is retracting inside her body and feeling that something will happen to her if it gets fully retracted for 9 months. She had multiple consultations with the gynecologist who found no anatomical abnormality on examination and referred the patient to a psychiatrist, where she was diagnosed with Koro syndrome and was started on psychotropic medication. Conclusion: Female with Koro syndrome is expressed mainly in an epidemic setting due to cultural and psycho-social factors such as cultural taboos that suppress the expression of atypical sexual symptoms, inadequate knowledge, and misconceptions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An evaluator's failure to recognize illness behavior and to adjust for its effect on symptom presentation can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding impairment or disability; here the authors review the associated phenomena of somatization, disorders that arise from it, and factors that contribute to somatization. Somatization is an individual's unconscious use of the body or bodily symptoms for psychological purposes or psychological gain. As the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, notes, somatization is a “tendency to experience and report somatic complaints (physical symptoms) in response to psychosocial stress and seek health care services for them.” The AMA Guides also advises evaluators that “exclusion or inclusion of somatization disorder, factitious disorder, and/or malingering must be done with care.” A table lists developmental factors that may dispose to somatization (eg, somatizers are present in the family of origin, or coping mechanisms other than illness behavior are absent or unacceptable); a second table compares disorders that may involve somatization. Somatization is prevalent in clinical practice and is likely to occur with equal, or higher, frequency in the evaluation setting. The presence of somatization distorts symptom presentation and can exert a confounding effect on impairment assessment methodologies that rely on the accuracy of patients’ self-presentations.",

It may give rise to a compression of a nerve root (a radiculopathy, with or without sensory-motor deficit) or of the spinal cord (myelopathy). The majority of CDHs can be supported by means of a conservative treatment. When a radiculopathy is found and a clinico-radiological correlation is present, a moderate neurological deficit appears suddenly, or if it is progressive under conservative treatment or if pain is poorly controlled by well-conducted conservative treatment performed during 6 to 8 months, surgery is then recommended. A symptomatic cervical myelopathy is, by itself, an indication for a surgical treatment.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "title": "SCN3A- Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-ND) encompasses a spectrum of clinical severity associated with epilepsy and/or brain malformation. Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with global developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe global developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN3A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Empiric treatment of seizures with standard anti-seizure medications (no specific anti-seizure medication has been shown to be more efficacious than another); feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with dysphagia; standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, autonomic dysfunction, and central visual impairment. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation for signs/symptoms of a movement disorder or autonomic dysfunction; monitor for new seizures or changes in seizures; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, behavioral issues, mobility and self-help skills; annual ophthalmology evaluation to assess for visual impairment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no evidence that specific anti-seizure medications can worsen seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. There is no evidence that sleep deprivation or fever exacerbate seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: Use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy reduces the risk for mortality during pregnancy, but exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A-ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Qualitat de vida, adaptació social i estrès en joves amb un primer episodi psicòtic o en risc de psicosi",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIO:\nLa qualitat de vida i el funcionament social han esdevingut bons indicadors per mesurar la millora clinica dels trastorns psicotics, i han estat ampliament estudiats en persones amb esquizofrenia. En les primeres fases de la psicosi el funcionament psicosocial i la qualitat de vida romanen sovint deteriorades fins i tot despres de la remissio dels simptomes psicotics, afectant als resultats a llarg termini de la malaltia. Es frequent tambe que aquest pitjor funcionament estigui present abans de l’aparicio del primer episodi psicotic (PEP), en la coneguda fase prodromica, fase caracteristica dels subjectes coneguts com Estats Mentals d’Alt Risc (EMAR). Per altra banda, el paper de l’estres en l’aparicio d’un trastorn psicotic ha estat objecte d’estudi i ha estat conceptualitzat en el que es coneix com el model de vulnerabilitat-estres per explicar l’etiopatogenesi de l’esquizofrenia: persones amb una predisposicio genetica a la malaltia la desenvoluparan o no en funcio de la relacio amb l’ambient i els successos que esdevinguin al llarg de la seva vida. L’estres pero, tambe ha estat estudiat en altre vessants i processos que afecten l’evolucio de la malaltia, com per exemple en que l’us d’estrategies d’afrontament negatives davant l’estres implica l’empitjorament de la qualitat de vida en pacients amb psicosi, o tambe en el fet que pacients amb psicosi sense ocupacio laboral refereixen majors nivells d’estres que els que treballen, essent la ocupacio laboral un element intimament relacionat amb la qualitat de vida en persones amb psicosi. Alguns elements d’estres clarament identificats dins dels anomentats aconteixements vitals estressats, com ara el maltractament infantil, tambe s’ han associat a una pitjor adaptacio premorbida en pacients que han debutat amb alguna malaltia psicotica. OBJECTIUS:\nL’objectiu principal de l’estudi va ser explorar la relacio entre la qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social en joves amb una psicosis incipient i investigar-ne els possibles efectes mediadors de les mesures d’estres. Per altra banda es pretenia analitzar la correlacio entre el maltractament infantil, com a esdeveniment estressant major, i l’adaptacio social.\n METODOLOGIA:\nAquesta tesi doctoral consta de tres treballs. El primer es un estudi analitic observacional i transversal on es van comparar les mesures d’estres i de qualitat de vida entre un grup de pacients considerats EMAR atesos en el servei de l’Equip d’Intervencio Precoc i un grup de quaranta controls sans. Posteriorment es va estratificar el grup de joves EMAR en funcio de l’adaptacio social que presentaven (baixa o normal segons puntuacions en l’escala d’adaptacio social SASS) i es va analitzar la qualitat de vida en base a aquesta estratificacio. Per ultim es va realitzar un analisi de mediacio per explorar si les mesures d’estres intervenien en la relacio entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida.\nEl segon, es un estudi observacional i prospectiu on es va mesurar la qualitat de vida, l’adaptacio social i les mesures d’estres de forma basal i a l’any posterior a la presentacio d’un PEP. L’evolucio de la qualitat de vida es va analitzar en funcio de les puntuacions en l’adaptacio social. Paral·lelament es van comaprar els resultats basals del grup de joves amb un PEP amb un grup de cinquanta-cinc controls sans i tambe es va mesurar l’efecte de mediacio de l’estres entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida en aquest grup d’estudi. \nEl tercer es tracta d’un estudi analitic observacional i transversal, on es va analitzar la relacio del maltractament infantil amb l’adaptacio social en totes les seves dimensions, d’un grup de joves amb una psicosi incipient utilitzant un model d’equacions estructurals, que permet un analisis multivariant de diferents subconjunts de variables, a l’hora que permet analitzar la relacio causal de variables de diferents grups.\n RESULTATS:\nEstudi 1.\nEls pacients EMAR van reportar taxes d’ocupacio laboral mes baixes, mes estres, pitjor qualitat de vida i menor adaptacio social que els controls sans. La qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social es van associar a les mesures d’estres. Els subjectes EMAR amb baixa adaptacio social van reportar mes estres percebut i pitjor qualitat de vida que els EMAR amb adaptacio social normal i que els controls sans. L’estres percebut va intervenir explicant la relacio que s’estableix entre l’adaptacio social i la qualitat de vida. \nEstudi 2. \nEls pacients van reportar una pitjor qualitat de vida, una pitjor adaptacio social i mes estres que els controls sans. Els pacients amb un PEP van millorar significativament la qualitat de vida i les mesures d’estres al llarg de l’any de seguiment, pero no l’adaptacio social. L’estres percebut va mediar l’associacio entre una pitjor adaptacio social i una qualitat de vida inferior. \nEstudi 3. \nEls EMAR van presentar mes negligencia emocional i pitjor adaptacio social comparats amb els PEP. El Model d'Equacions Estructurals (MEE) emprat va mostrar que el maltractament s’associa a una pitjor adaptacio social, principalment en dominis que impliquen relacions interpersonals. Quan els simptomes depressius fan de mediadors, es a dir, que expliquen com es la relacio que s’estableix entre el maltractament i l’adaptacio social, tambe es veuen afectats els dominis d’oci i treball i interessos socio-culturals. CONCLUSIONS:\nL’adaptacio social es menor en els subjectes EMAR que en subjectes sans. Aquesta te un impacte negatiu sobre la qualitat de vida dels joves EMAR. L’associacio entre la qualitat de vida i l’adaptacio social esta influenciada per l’estres percebut.\nEn el cas dels joves amb un PEP, l’adaptacio social a l’inici pot determinar la qualitat de vida durant el periode d’un any posterior a l’inici de la malaltia. Malgrat la millora en la majoria de mesures estudiades en l’any posterior al PEP, els pacients no aconsegueixen el mateix nivell de qualitat de vida que els del grup sense patologia. \nPer ultim, els antecedents de maltractament infantil influeixen negativament en l’adaptacio social de joves amb una psicosi incipient.",

      "title": "Depression and Suicide in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Depressive disorders in children and adolescents are common and often disabling. They can interfere with normal growth and development, academic performance, and interpersonal relationships, and they are a significant risk factor for suicide. These disorders fall on a spectrum that ranges from mild symptoms of depressed mood, which might occur in response to an acute stressor, to pervasive sad or irritable mood accompanied by problems with sleep, appetite, social isolation, and sometimes, suicidal ideas, plans, and intent. Prevalence rates for depression range from 1% to 2% of prepubertal children to 3% to 8% of adolescents. Depression in prepubertal children and bipolar disorder in any age group are equally common in both sexes. However, unipolar depressive disorders in adolescents are more common in girls than in boys (ratio of 3:1), and early onset of puberty in girls increases the risk for depression. (1)Depressed children and adolescents manifest a variety of signs and symptoms. They can be sad, irritable, or angry and may present with school or behavioral problems. They can demonstrate somatic complaints (eg, headache, stomachache, muscle weakness), decreased or increased appetite, fatigue, insomnia, hypersomnia, or disturbed sleep-wake cycles. Some children and adolescents develop psychotic features consistent with their mood symptoms, such as paranoid delusions or auditory hallucinations with self-deprecatory content. Some develop self-injurious behaviors or suicidal ideation, plan, and intent. Anxiety symptoms may be present and may predate the development of depressive symptoms. Behavioral problems ranging from oppositional defiance to frank conduct disorder may occur in conjunction with an underlying mood disorder.Depressive disorders vary in degree of severity as well as in intensity and duration of symptoms. Adjustment disorders accompanied by depressed mood can be acute but severe; major depression (with or without psychotic features) can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders are specific and detailed and can be found in the latest American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.Potential risk factors for depression are many, ranging from genetic loading to tumultuous life events. However, it is the interaction between biologic vulnerability and environmental stress that takes center stage. Environmental risk factors include abuse or neglect; parental substance abuse; marital problems; low socioeconomic status and education level; loss of parent, sibling, or close friend; and stress related to adolescent developmental or issues of sexuality (eg, homosexuality). Genetic risk factors seem to play a greater role in adolescent depression than in prepubertal depression, with the most potent risk factor being parental depression. The depressed parent contributes both genetic vulnerability and emotional unavailability that can contribute to family dissension and instability. Newer research suggests that the combination of adverse life events and the presence of the shorter allelic form of the serotonin transporter gene results in early-onset depression. (2)Functional neuroimaging studies in children and adolescents reflect many of the same findings seen in similar studies of adults. The details of such adult studies are beyond the scope of this review, but most have found smaller prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in depressed individuals. Less work has been done in this area with children and adolescents because of the higher risks associated with radiation exposure. Early, preliminary studies suggest that such structural differences may be transmitted genetically and serve as a marker of inherited risk for depression. (3)The nature of the relationship between neuroendocrine changes and depressive disorders in children and adolescents is not well understood. Abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, as detected by the dexamethasone suppression test, may reflect a similar risk for depressive disorders in children and adolescents as for adults. Studies of growth hormone secretion theorize that a blunted response to growth hormone may represent vulnerability for early-onset depression in children and adolescents. Similarly, response patterns of depressed children and nondepressed children who have family histories of affective illness may be associated with an increased risk of depression as well as aggressive and suicidal behavior in children and adolescents. (4)Other risk factors for depressive disorders include certain types of medications (glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives, isotretinoin, antiviral agents) and any chronic illness such as cystic fibrosis, juvenile diabetes, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, sickle cell anemia, organ transplantation, and cancer.Diagnosing depressive disorders in children and adolescents can be difficult because the presentation can vary widely, depending on developmental stage. Furthermore, almost all children experience some sadness at times of stress, and normal adolescence can be a time of intense moodiness, impulsivity, and erratic behavior. Nevertheless, the risk for continued morbidity and impairment of social function makes differentiation of children who demonstrate symptoms consistent with significant depression from those who are transiently upset in response to stressful circumstances very important. Such assessment can be difficult because few reliable tests support the differentiation. The clinical history and mental status examination are most important. Such evaluations can be time-consuming and challenging because children and adolescents may not volunteer information about their mood, feelings, and circumstances unless they are asked specific, detailed questions. Furthermore, even if asked, they may not be able to recognize or describe changes in mood.Pediatricians who evaluate children and adolescents must determine the presence or absence of symptoms of a depressive disorder; the child's current level of functioning relative to his or her baseline; and the potential for self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempt. The evaluation involves obtaining a history from the child as well as from the parent or guardian and other caregivers such as teachers, counselors, or coaches. The family's cultural background can contribute to the child's presentation and must be taken into account.The child may report disturbances in mood, sleep, or appetite or note suicidal thoughts or wishes but may be less likely to comment on changes in peer relationships or school performance. Information about interpersonal interactions should be obtained from collateral sources. Any child affected with a disturbance of mood that is persistent and pervasive and interferes with day-to-day functioning should be assessed for depression. Although some fear that asking children and adolescents questions about their level of psychosocial functioning, their mood, or their risk for self-injury can predispose them to mood disorders or to destructive action, all available evidence suggests the opposite. (5)Assessment of depressive disorders in children must be viewed through the developmental lens. What may be an acute stressor for an elementary school student may have less affective resonance for a middle or high school student and vice versa. A high school freshman will not expect to make the varsity basketball team, whereas a fifth grader might be devastated if relegated to a \"B\" team after tryouts. A chronic illness such as cystic fibrosis may be less difficult for an 8-year-old third grader who still can play video games and go out for recess than for a high school student who cannot keep up with the rapid pace of school, sports, and parties, who feels ostracized and isolated, and who understands the concept of terminal illness. The importance of such stressors can be missed if the clinician does not recognize the potential power of a seemingly minor loss or defeat in the life of a child.Supplementation of the clinical history with self-report questionnaires can be enormously helpful, particularly in the primary care setting. Examples of such instruments include the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), (6) which assesses the severity of depression in prepubertal school-age children, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), (7) Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS-2), (8) and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ) (9) for older adolescents. The Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care (GLAD-PC) Toolkit also has child and parent report measures and scoring instructions on their web site (http://www.thereachinstitute.org/files/documents/GLAD-PCToolkit.pdf). This user-friendly online resource also includes management flowcharts, scales, and educational materials in English and Spanish, as well as tracking forms and information on billing.Comorbid disorders in depressed children and adolescents include anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance abuse, and conduct disorder. Some disorders, such as ADHD, may be transmitted genetically in families; others likely have a bidirectional causality with, for example, substance abuse (alcohol, recreational drugs, tobacco) as both a potential cause and effect of depression.Management of child and adolescent depressive disorders in primary care settings is challenging because of time constraints, the paucity of formal clinical guidelines, and lack of access to mental health professionals. Nevertheless, given the morbidity and potential mortality associated with depression in children and adolescents, pediatricians have a responsibility to learn to identify children at risk and ensure appropriate evaluation either by themselves or with consultation or referral.For children and adolescents who have mild depressive symptoms, supportive counseling, problem-solving discussions, and education of family members may suffice. However, for more severe symptoms, other interventions may be necessary. Approaches for treatment of moderate and severe depression include the prescribing of medication, either alone or with other interpersonal therapies. Three types of treatments are validated empirically: 1) psychopharmacologic intervention, specifically selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), either alone or in combination with psychotherapy; 2) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and 3) interpersonal therapy (IPT).Antidepressant medications, specifically the SSRIs, have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression in adults, children, and adolescents. Currently, fluoxetine is the only antidepressant approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of children and adolescents, although research studies have demonstrated efficacy of other drugs such as citalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline. The 2006 FDA meta-analysis of children and adolescents taking SSRIs for the treatment of depression found an increased risk of suicidality in those patients treated with drugs versus those given placebo. Subsequent meta-analysis, using additional studies not included in the FDA report, revealed that those who benefited from SSRI treatment outnumbered those who became suicidal during SSRI treatment by a ratio of 14:1. Some suggest that the temporal relationship between the decrease in prescribing practices after implementation of the FDA black box warning and the recent increase in adolescent suicide attempts provides evidence that SSRI treatment of depression can be lifesaving. (10)Because the most evidence for efficacy and safety exists for fluoxetine, many suggest that it should be the first choice for medication management of depressive symptoms. The success of treatment can be reassessed after a 6- to 8-week trial, unless adverse effects or a worsening clinical picture dictate earlier intervention. Common adverse effects from fluoxetine include nausea and vomiting, sleep disturbance with vivid dreams, and agitation. Dosage can start as low as 2.5 mg/day for prepubertal children and 10 mg/day for older adolescents, with increases based on clinical response at 2-week intervals according to the pharmacokinetic profile of the medication. Most patients respond to fluoxetine at doses ranging from 20 to 80 mg/day.For vulnerable patients, any antidepressant can precipitate agitation and secondary mania and, therefore, should be used with caution. The FDA suggests careful monitoring of medication response, with weekly face-to-face meetings between caregiver and patient or patient's family for the first month, although no evidence supports such management, and it is likely that weekly consultation by phone could be sufficient. The interval between visits can be lengthened to biweekly for the next 4 weeks and subsequently reduced further, based on the clinical situation. Consideration of a trial of other antidepressants in children and adolescents, either SSRIs or other classes, should prompt consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist prior to initiation. Studies regarding clinical efficacy and response of childhood depression to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants and the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine have been inconclusive.Most unipolar, untreated depressive disorders in children and adolescents last between 3 and 12 months. The risk of recurrence ranges from 34% to 50% within the first year after discontinuation of treatment; 50% to 75% of affected children have a relapse within 8 years following the initial episode. (11) Comorbid disorders such as anxiety or substance abuse, presence of suicidal ideation, recurrent episodes of parental depression, and family chaos predispose to a longer duration of active symptoms.Depression in children and adolescents should be conceptualized as a chronic illness. Clinicians should treat the acute episode until the patient's symptoms are in remission. Additional treatment should focus on prevention. In general, if the symptoms have not improved or remitted after a 6- to 8-week trial on medication or if the patient has developed intolerable adverse effects, the clinician should change medication. If the response to treatment has been partial, the clinician might consider increasing the dose of the current medication, adding another agent, or suggesting other types of therapy. Of note, treatment failure in adolescents might be due to noncompliance rather than refractory symptoms. If the patient's depression has gone into remission, therapy to prevent recurrence should continue for another 6 to 9 months. More than 90% of children and adolescent outpatients who have depressive disorder recover within 1 to 2 years. Because no data are available on the long-term effects of medication on children or adolescents, it is difficult to justify indefinite continuation of treatment. However, given the risks for recurrence and relapse, it is prudent to monitor children and adolescents closely, even after treatment.CBT is the best studied nonpharmacologic intervention for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. The theoretical underpinning of this therapy postulates that depressed children and adolescents have distortions in their thought processes that cause them to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects of any given situation. Stressful events serve to accentuate the negative ideation and precipitate depressive episodes, which then may cause counterproductive or maladaptive behaviors. A common therapeutic format includes: psychoeducation; behavioral modification involving active scheduling of enjoyable activities; cognitive restructuring to reframe distortions and allow for new, more rational thoughts; and learning self-relaxation techniques. Most studies of CBT have suggested that it is an extremely effective intervention for depressive disorders in children and adolescents.The Treatment for Adolescent Depression Study (TADS), published in 2004, evaluated fluoxetine, CBT, and the combination of the two in terms of relative efficacy in the treatment of adolescent depression versus placebo. (12) In this well-powered study, fluoxetine and CBT together and fluoxetine alone were superior to CBT alone and to placebo. CBT alone failed to demonstrate the same efficacy found in earlier studies, perhaps because the patients in TADS were extremely ill and presented with more comorbid conditions. It also is possible that the CBT treatment package used in TADS employed too many different techniques to allow any one technique enough time to succeed.IPT centers on the problems in the patient's interpersonal interactions, seeking to change conflicted, hostile relationships into supportive, meaningful, and satisfying ones. The focus of the therapy usually is on development of social skills and investigation of the effect of shifting roles within family or peer groups, including adjustment to such events as parental divorce or remarriage. In IPT, the patient looks at his or her place within a larger social context. In contrast, CBT focuses on the patient's internal thought processes and how they influence perspective and behavioral patterns.Any one of the three previously noted approaches is a reasonable first choice in the treatment of children and adolescents whose symptoms are moderate. Medication likely is the best choice for those who have more severe symptoms, coupled with CBT or supportive counseling, depending on available resources. Evidence suggests that the relationship and degree of trust between child and therapist is a good predictor of the efficacy of therapy. Children and adolescents who fail to respond to initial interventions within 6 to 8 weeks and those who have very severe mood disorders and accompanying significant impairment in psychosocial functioning or suicidal ideation, plan, or intent should be referred to a child psychiatrist or mental health specialist, if possible (Table 1). Most children and adolescents who have depressive disorders can be managed as outpatients. However, those who are actively suicidal, homicidal, or psychotic should be hospitalized.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (13) suicide is the third leading cause of death in the United States among adolescents and young adults ages 10 to 24 years. From 1990 to 2003, suicide rates in that age group declined from 9.48 to 6.78 per 100,000. However, from 2003 to 2004 (the most recent year for which data are available), the rate increased to 7.32 per 100,000. This increase reflects upward trends in three groups: females ages 10 to 14 years and 15 to 19 years and males ages 15 to 19 years. Hanging/suffocation was the most common cause of death in females in all age groups and firearms the most common method used by males. There are ethnic disparities within these age groups: Native American/Alaskan Native youth and Hispanic females have a higher percentage of suicide attempts than their peers. Few prepubertal children successfully commit suicide (suicide rate 0.6 per 100,000 for ages 5 to 14 years), but these children are at high risk for suicide attempts in their adolescence and young adulthood.Suicidal ideation and gestures also are increasing in frequency. Although there is no national registry for such behaviors, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, 2005, a survey of high school students across the United States, reveal that 16.9% considered suicide and 8.4% had attempted suicide within the past year. Both mood and anxiety disorders increase the likelihood of suicidal ideation. In prepubertal children, suicidal ideation can be associated with disruptive disorders. In adolescents, substance abuse and separation anxiety may predispose to such ideation.These statistics are sobering and argue for vigorous efforts at early identification of children and adolescents at risk as well as aggressive prevention and intervention. One instrument used to screen adolescents for psychiatric illness is the Teen-Screen, a school-based program that screened 55,000 students in 2005. The screening has two parts: a self-report questionnaire and an open-ended interview by a skilled mental health professional. The combination of the questionnaire and interview ensures that a positive result on the self-report also is reflected in the clinical history. The program is voluntary but requires consent of the student's parent or guardian. If the student's questionnaire and interview suggest the presence of psychiatric illness, he or she is referred for additional psychiatric evaluation. The Teen-Screen is controversial because many feel that it violates parental rights and that the high false-positive rate invalidates the testing. Although the \"screen\" has a high sensitivity but low specificity, the risk of overlooking a truly suicidal adolescent seems greater than the risk of misdiagnosing (and potentially stigmatizing) a normal teenager.About 70% of adolescents are seen by their primary care physicians at least once a year. The same percentage reports a willingness to talk with their primary care physicians about their mental health. Pediatricians must be trained to detect psychiatric illness that may predispose their patients to self-injurious behaviors. They also must be alert to the risk factors for suicide in children and adolescents: mood disorder, substance abuse, loss of a loved one, family discord, social isolation, family history of suicidal behavior, previous suicide attempt, and availability of firearms.Any child experiencing a mood disorder or substance abuse should be considered at risk for suicide and evaluated thoroughly. Questions to ask might include those listed in Table 2. If a child or adolescent is actively suicidal, with plan or intent or both, the clinician should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the safety of the child.Suicidal \"gestures,\" such as superficial cutting or ingestion of a few extra pills, must be taken seriously. Any episode of self-inflicted harm may be a sign of attempted suicide. A child or adolescent might believe that the \"gesture\" could have caused death or he or she might believe that an overdose of, for example, acetaminophen is safe because it is a drug that can be bought easily at the drugstore. It also is important to review with the child or adolescent what \"death\" or \"killing oneself\" means. A child younger than 6 years of age might be unable to appreciate the finality of death.No evidence suggests that \"no suicide contracts\" (in which the patient agrees not to harm him- or herself and lists ways to help him- or herself should suicidal feelings arise) are preventive. If the child or adolescent is actively suicidal, it is unlikely that he or she is in any position to understand the contract or to agree to it. Furthermore, once such a contract is signed, parents or guardians charged with helping the child to stay safe might become less vigilant.For a child or adolescent who has attempted suicide, it is helpful to assess the risk/rescue ratio. This practice assesses the risk of the action in relation to the likelihood of rescue. The child who overdoses on a medication late at night, tells no one, and goes to sleep hoping never to wake up is different from the child who takes a handful of pills while standing in the kitchen arguing with a parent.In most cases, the legal guardians (parents or other caregivers) must be informed of the results of the assessment; issues of confidentiality become moot in the setting of active suicidal (or homicidal) ideation with intent and plan. Questions regarding availability of and access to firearms and other vectors of harm (including knives, drugs, and poisons) must be discussed, with the goal of removing access to these items in the home or any place where the child or adolescent might go. Usually, it is necessary to hospitalize actively suicidal children and adolescents on psychiatric inpatient units for their immediate safety as well as for containment, stabilization, psychopharmacologic evaluation, and ultimate referral to an outpatient network of care.One of the most frightening aspects of adolescent suicides is the potential for contagion and cluster formation. Perspectives differ on what constitutes a \"cluster,\" but for the purposes of this article, it is defined as three or more suicides occurring within the same community that bear a temporal relationship to one another. The etiology of cluster formation is controversial. One theory looks at suicide as an infectious disease, as if the impetus to kill oneself is contagious. Another suggests that vulnerable adolescents, particularly those who are depressed, become suicidal in the face of intense loss. Cluster formation can pose a true public health dilemma because too much media coverage (television, Internet) can contribute to the contagious or imitative risk. However, that risk must be balanced with the need for information to be distributed throughout the community as an aid in the process of recovery and healing.",

Only a small minority of MUS are due to unrecognized physical disease.Assess for physical conditions, yet avoid unnecessary medical tests.Review symptom characteristics and their effect on functioning.Consider using screening tools to help clarify the diagnosis (eg, general psychosocial screening tools, Children’s Somatization Inventory, Functional Disability Inventory).Include the diagnosis of somatic symptom and related disorders from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, in the differential diagnosis, not merely as an excluded diagnosis.Intervention by the pediatric clinician can include all the following steps:Empathetically acknowledging distress caused by MUSReaching agreement with the patient and family on incremental steps toward improving functioning and addressing co-occurring mental health concerns and improving the family’s mental health generally (see General Treatment Approach: Universal Strategies to Reinforce Strengths and Promote Emotional Health Within Families\")Encouraging the family to reinforce healthy behaviors and minimize secondary gainConveying optimism that distress will decrease with interventionEducating the patient and familyCoordinating with other clinicians involved in the child’s care to prevent unnecessary attention to physical concerns and costly, intrusive workupsWhen severe impairment occurs, refer to mental health professionals for evidence-based therapy and ensure treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions.",

      "abstract": "Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a neuropsychiatric sleep disorder primarily affecting adolescent males. Onset is insidious, idiopathic, and hastened by neurological incident or infection. Typically, the initial onset occurs during the teen years or after the second decade, although cases have been documented in early childhood, adulthood, and senescence. KLS is marked by unexpected debilitating, yet reversible, episodic hypersomnia, with varying recurrence rates; cognitive and behavioral impairment; compulsive eating; and feelings of derealization, hypersexuality, apathy, and depressed mood. Diagnosis is problematic due to the syndrome's rarity, disparity of presenting clinical symptoms, and misdiagnosis. Correct diagnosis can take up to 4 years. The clinical course is approximately 8 to 14 years from initial onset, yet may be longer in the adult form of the disorder. KLS has been shown to impact activities of daily living, usurping an adolescent of his/her social relations with peers, experiences, and time.

There is, however, a marked decline in medication adherence in adolescence, which continues into adulthood, with less than 10% of adults with ADHD continuing to use medication. Moreover, psychosocial treatments too often do not continue to be used or adapted to new challenges. Thus, it is difficult to conclude what impact medication and/or psychosocial treatments would have on adult outcomes should these treatments be adhered to and applied continuously. As it stands, the lack of impact from treatments in childhood suggests that ADHD is a chronic condition, and that ongoing regular follow-up may be needed to offer patients interventions (medication and psychosocial treatment) that they require both to improve their symptoms in the short-term and promote more positive long-term outcome.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

      "abstract": "Summary The analysis of 100 women with menopausal complaints, assessed according to the Menopause Rating Scale I from the start of therapy, and continuing over months and years, revealed new aspects. The frequency of the individual symptoms does not correspond to what is stated in the literature: in particular, only less than 80 % complain of hot flushes, a noteworthy 69 % of disorders of the joints and muscles, and 53 % of sexual dysfunction. The responsiveness to hormone replacement therapy does not correspond to the frequency: functional disorders of the heart, for example (which only 42 % of the patients report as a symptom), react positively in 97 % of cases, and sexual dysfunction, which occurs in only 53 % of cases, reacts positively in at least 74 % of these. How soon improvement begins also varies according to the symptom. Whereas hot flushes, sleep disturbances and nervousness react quickly (within 10 days) and intensively, for disorders of the joints and muscles, and sexual dysfunction, there is an average delay of up to several months. Moderately severe and slight symptoms react to hormone replacement therapy in a manner similar to the severe symptoms and not, in fact, more or less. If, for example, hot flushes disappear under the therapy, but sexual dysfunction initially does not, it is entirely possible for improvement in this symptom to occur later. Until now, the differing effect of hormone replacement therapy on the individual symptoms was not known. This knowledge can be of major importance for compliance during the women’s treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most frequent sex chromosomal aneuploidy. The karyotype 47,XXY originates from either paternal or maternal meiotic nondisjunction during gametogenesis. KS males are very likely to exhibit marked gonadal dysfunctions, presenting both in severely attenuated spermatogenesis as well as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. In addition, neurocognitive and psychosocial impairments, as well as cardiovascular, metabolic and bone disorders are often found in KS and might explain for an increased morbidity/mortality. All conditions in KS are likely to be induced by both gene overdosage effects resulting from supernumerary X‐chromosomal genes as well as testosterone deficiency. Notwithstanding, the clinical features are highly variable between KS men. Symptoms can become obvious at infancy, childhood, or adolescence. However, the majority of KS subjects is diagnosed during adulthood. KS adolescents require specific attention regarding pubertal development, in order to exploit their remaining fertility potential and allow for timely and tailored testosterone replacement. The chances for sperm retrieval might decline with age and could be hampered by testosterone replacement; therefore, cryostorage of spermatozoa is an option during adolescence, before the decompensation of endocrine and exocrine testicular functions becomes more overt. Sperm from semen or surgically retrieved, in combination with intracytoplasmic sperm injection enables KS males to become biological fathers of healthy children. The aim of this article is to present the current knowledge on KS, to guide clinical care and to highlight research needs.",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

Sexual disorders after stroke are thought to be due to multiple etiologies, including both organic (e.g., lesion localization, premorbid medical conditions, medications) and psychosocial (e.g., fear of recurrences, loss of self-esteem, role changes, anxiety and depression) etiologies.

Usually such patients have been defined as those who have been hospitalized continuously for at least six months or more [14-16]. In studies concerning long-stay patients, the subjects have been predominantly schizophrenics, their clinical symptoms are severe, and it is problematic to place them anywhere other than in a hospital [17-19]. Psychiatric inpatients have in recent years been found to be more severely disturbed than was previously the case, possibly because of the deinstitutionalization process [1 8-20].",

Symptoms are often mild, but can be severe enough to substantially affect daily activities. About 5–8% of women thus suffer from severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS); most of these women also meet criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Mood and behavioral symptoms, including irritability, tension, depressed mood, tearfulness, and mood swings, are the most distressing, but somatic complaints, such as breast tenderness and bloating, can also be problematic. We outline theories for the underlying causes of severe PMS, and describe two main methods of treating it: one targeting the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis, and the other targeting brain serotonergic synapses. Fluctuations in gonadal hormone levels trigger the symptoms, and thus interventions that abolish ovarian cyclicity, including long-acting analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or estradiol (administered as patches or implants), effectively reduce the symptoms, as can some oral contraceptives. The effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, taken throughout the cycle or during luteal phases only, is also well established.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

Impairments of sex steroid concentrations, hypothalamic pituitary function, as well as testicular function, form a basis for reproductive dysfunction in male patients with epilepsy.

      "abstract": "Statement of the Problem: Gambling is common in Australian society – nearly 75 per cent of Australian adults gamble in any year. About 300,000 Australians have a gambling problem, but only 10 per cent of people with problematic gambling behaviour seek help. The hidden nature of gambling disorder has the minimal signs and symptoms concealing the level of severity associated with this condition subsequently causing significant dysfunction for individuals, and families. Findings: Current research recognises that the course of the disorder can vary by type of gambling as well as life circumstances, and acknowledges the overwhelming evidence indicating its association with consistently high rates of comorbid psychopathology-particularly mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders; other impulse control disorders; bipolar disorder; and antisocial personality disorder. For instance, a meta-analysis of 11 population surveys found high mean prevalence for nicotine dependence (60.1%), a substance use disorder (57.5%), depressive disorders (37.9%), and anxiety disorders (37.4%). Theoretical Orientation: As the largest Victorian service, Gambler’s Help Southern (GHS) offers a range of evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions often individually tailored and underpinned by CognitiveBehaviour Therapy (CBT), minimal or brief interventions, Motivational Enhancement Therapies (MET), mindfulness-based therapies, group and couple therapies. Newly created interactive online video psychological interventions and prevention programs will be made available to individuals with problematic gambling behaviour, and families who are mostly new to treatment. Financial counselling delivers a range of interventions integrated with therapeutic and other services. GHS assists close to 2,000 people across Melbourne southern catchments per annum. Conclusion: While psychological treatment approaches and interventions are essential to manage tertiary prevention of gambling, influencing public policy changes are equally necessary, supporting a range of strategies from prevention, health promotion and treatment, at individual, community, industry and government levels.",

      "abstract": "L’alcoolo-dépendance est une maladie chronique hautement récidivante dont l’enjeu principal est la prévention des rechutes. Les rechutes sont favorisées par le ressenti du sujet vis-à-vis de son environnement social [1]. L’alcoolo-dépendance entraîne des troubles cognitivo-comportementaux dont des déficits de reconnaissance émotionnelle et une altération des interactions sociales [2] majorant le risque de rechutes [3]. Ces troubles pourraient être liés à une altération du sentiment de familiarité. La familiarité se définit comme un sentiment de connaissance préalable d’un stimulus générant une émotion inconsciente, sans souvenir conscient de son identité [4]. Nous nous proposons d’étudier la familiarité aux visages dans l’alcoolo-dépendance. Douze patients alcoolo-dépendants (AD) étaient appariés en sexe et en âge à 12 témoins (T). Les participants ne présentaient ni trouble psychiatrique, ni neurologique, ni addiction en dehors d’un trouble d’usage sévère d’alcool pour le groupe AD (classification DSM-5). Des morphes entre visages familiers et inconnus (contenant 5 à 95 % du visage familier) étaient présentés. Les sujets devaient indiquer les visages leur semblant familiers. Un pourcentage de réponse « familier » était alors calculé par niveau de familiarité, permettant de construire une fonction psychométrique par sujet, et d’en déduire le seuil de familiarité (pourcentage de familiarité contenue dans le morphe pour lequel 50 % des stimuli étaient considérés comme familiers). Les interactions sociales étaient évaluées par une échelle de cognition sociale (MASC). Le seuil de familiarité était significativement plus faible dans le groupe AD que dans le groupe T (48,79 % versus 54,94 % – p = 0,025). Parallèlement les 2 groupes différaient sur les scores au MASC (AD : 26/45 ; T : 31/45 – p = 0,015). Ces résultats démontrent une hyperfamiliarité dans l’alcoolo-dépendance, associée à une altération de la cognition sociale. L’implication de l’altération de ces deux processus sur les risques de rechute est abordée.",

      "abstract": "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that encodes a protein of the peroxisomal membrane named ALDP. Mutations in ALDP result in elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and reduced VLCFA oxidation in peroxisomes. Three main phe-notypes are seen in affected males. The childhood cerebral form manifests usually between ages 4 and 8 years. It initially resembles attention deficit disorder or hyperactivity. Progressive central demyelination with impairment of cognition, behavior, vision, hearing, and motor function follow the initial symptoms and often lead to total disability within 2 years. The second phenotype, adrenomyeloneuropathy, manifests most commonly in the late twenties as progressive paraparesis, sphincter disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and often, impaired adrenocortical function; all symptoms are progressive over decades. The third phenotype, 'Addison disease only', presents with primary adrenocortical insufficiency between age 2 years and adulthood and most commonly by age 7.5 years, without evidence of neurologic abnormality. Approximately 50% of females who are carriers develop neurologic manifestations that resemble adrenomyeloneuropathy but have a later onset (age ≧35 years) and a milder disease. In this review, we will give an overview of the present understanding of ALD, and the implications of new diagnostics and treatment.",

It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Displays of inappropriate sexual behaviour by patients with progressive cognitive impairment: the forgotten form of challenging behaviour?",
      "abstract": "Accessible summary • Individuals with cognitive impairment may display a range of challenging behaviours such as agitation, aggression or inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB). • ISB incorporates any verbal or physical action of a sexual nature displayed within an inappropriate social context. • Although ISB is less common than other forms of challenging behaviour, it may still have a range of deleterious effects on the victims health. • Nurses are at risk of being exposed to ISB and this article will provide a useful insight to the nursing profession of this phenomenon. Abstract Persons with progressive cognitive impairment such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease may display an array of challenging behaviours. For instance, levels of agitation and aggression have been reported as high as 33% in home-dwelling individuals and 80% in those residing in institutions. One form of challenging behaviour that may be displayed by this group is inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB), but it is often overshadowed by other behaviours such as aggression. Inappropriate sexual behaviour involves any verbal of physical action of a sexual nature which is displayed in an inappropriate social context. Examples of ISB include: exposure of genitals in public/ward environments, ‘groping’ of nurses and masturbation in public areas. It has been estimated that the prevalence of ISB ranges from 2% to 17% of individuals with progressive cognitive impairment. Although it is less frequent than other challenging behaviours, it still may have significant deleterious effects on the victim's health. This paper is a review of the available literature on the nature, effects and management of ISB in persons with progressive cognitive impairment. Possible avenues for future research are also explored.",

      "title": "Vascular depression – regarding a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Age-related vascular changes have long been documented as an etiopathogenic factor of some geriatric depressive syndromes. More recently, it has emerged the concept of “Vascular Depression” recognizing that cardiovascular disease may predispose, precipitate or perpetuate late life depression. This condition was defined by an episode of major depressive disorder within the preceding 12 months in elderly with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease, or major cardiovascular risk factors. Vascular Depression isn`t described in DSM-V, and that difficults clinical recognition and affects clinically informed systematic studies. Objectives Regarding a clinical case, we enphasize the clinical impact of Vascular Depression`s hypothesis. Methods We present a qualitative review of this topic using the Pubmed Central database. Results 74 years old male patient, with major depressive disorder about ten years. Depressive and cognitive symptoms didn`t respond to antidepressive treatment and his functional state has gradually declined. Conclusions Vascular depression develops after the 60 – 65 years in the absence of personal and family history of affective disorder. The key symptoms are low energy, anhedonia, deficits in selfinitiation, psychomotor retardation, reduced processing speed and lack of insight into mood symptoms. Clinical assessment includes a review of history of vascular risk factors or/and disease, but also an imagiological evidence demonstrating subcortical white matter abnormalities. Insidious and chronic course tends to delay its recognition and management. This becomes critical because Vascular Depression is associated with poor response to antidepressant treatment and persistent depressive symptoms. It`s also associated with poor selfmanagement of comorbidities and impairment in daily function. Increased mortality from all causes is widely documented.",

      "title": "Heterogeneity in the prognosis of major depression: from the common cold to a highly debilitating and recurrent illness",
      "abstract": "Two different and seemingly competing views on the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) exist. The first is that the diagnosis conflates adaptive sadness reactions with pathological states of depressed mood and that MDD is overdiagnosed and overtreated. The second is that MDD is an underdiagnosed and undertreated disorder, and one that is best characterised by a severe, chronic, recurrent or treatment-resistant course. Existing research suggests that both views are valid and merit being integrated. Anywhere from 30 to 50% of individuals will meet criteria for MDD at some point in their life. About half of these episodes are of brief duration and unlikely to recur. However, a remaining half is either chronic or recurrent. Data on the outpatient diagnosis of depression support the view that depression is simultaneously underdiagnosed and undertreated as well as overdiagnosed and overtreated. About one-third of the patients who meet criteria for MDD and receive placebos experience clinically significant and long-lasting improvement. Many other patients, however, are unresponsive to one or multiple active treatments. Thus, the diagnosis of MDD likely applies to individuals who are experiencing either normal periods of sadness or single-episode afflictions that are mild, unlikely to recur, and are placebo responsive, as well as to individuals with more severe clinical profiles. More research is needed that can help ascertain what contextual or biopsychological variables help distinguish between individuals who may be experiencing adaptive states of negative affect and those who experience severe, chronic, recurrent or treatment-resistant depressions.",

Frequent diseases most commonly encountered in elderly patients--i.e. diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, depression, etc--represent a frequent cause of erectile dysfunction (ED) and are treated with medications that can interfere with sexual functioning at the central and/or peripheral level. Antidepressants, including the tricyclics and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, have been implicated in ED, decreased libido, and impaired ejaculation. Most antihypertensives have been associated with some erectile impairment, but diuretics seem to have little effect on erectile function. The calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors are associated with a low incidence of ED. Sympatholytic antihypertensives seldom cause importence but can cause retrograde ejaculation because of the relaxation of the smooth muscles in the prostatic urethra and bladder neck. The most commonly prescription drugs that can affect sexual function are briefly discussed and an integrated pharmacological approach to the patient with drug-induced ED is proposed.",

      "abstract": "Genital self-mutilation is usually believed to be rare and to be predominantly practiced by men, especially those suffering grave mental illness. Castration occupies a central place in psychoanalytical theory, which suggests various symbols for the supposedly diverse fantasy of castration. A review of the literature revealed only about 60 cases. 3 diagnostic categories have been suggested for such cases: schizophrenics, transvestites or transsexuals, and patients with religious and cultural complexes. Factors believed to be common to persons practicing genital self-mutilation include intense sexual confusion, masochistic relationships with and submission to women, strong feminine identification, repudiation of the penis, and depression relieved by the mutilation. Explicit motivations were expressed in over 60% of cases, including desire to be a woman, existence of homosexual sentiments, real or imagined illness, and heterosexual sentiments. Extreme religiosity, psychotic symptoms, and a feeling of failure in the masculine role are often mentioned. 5 patients in 1 series of 53 attempted suicide and 1 succeeded. 87% were considered psychotic. 25% ingested alcohol before the act. 3 characteristics among psychotic subjects suggest a high risk of mutilation: very young psychotic men with sexual obsessions and fears, older men with psychotic depression or grave somatic illness, and men tending to become violent on drinking alcohol. Nonpsychotic subjects tend to display rage against themselves. Nonpsychotic transsexuals often had old fantasies of mutilation, and in 1/5 of cases some previous attempt had been made. A series of 3 cases observed by the author displayed a variety of circumstances: a 23-year old man with no observed psychosis wished to be free of sexual tumult and desire to masturbate for religious reasons, a 42-year old man had a fit of delirium and castrated himself with a saber, and a 32-year old chronic psychotic emasculated himself with his pajama cord and died shortly thereafter. Very few cases of female self-mutilation have been observed.",

Many with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and/or generalized anxiety disorder present initially to their primary care clinician. Effective treatment is possible in a busy primary care setting; therapy involves patient education and pharmacotherapy. Once other potential causes of symptoms of an anxiety disorder have been ruled out, the first step is to reassure the patient that he or she has a psychological condition-a very common one-and that symptoms are not the result of an undiagnosed disease or going crazy or losing control. Educate and inform patients that complete clinical remission is achievable, often with medication alone. Begin treatment on day 1 with a long-acting benzodiazepine-such as alprazolam XR or clonazepam-or with the anxiolytic agent buspirone; at the same time, start a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The anxiolytic agent allays acute somatic symptoms until the full effects of the SSRI are manifest (often 4 to 6 weeks). The anxiolytic can then be gradually tapered. Referral to a psychiatrist for psychotherapy may be indicated when a patient refuses or cannot tolerate drug therapy, or when response to therapy is inadequate.",

      "abstract": "Normal sexual function is a biopsychosocial process; sexual dysfunction almost always has organic and psychological components and requires multidisciplinary, goal-directed evaluation and treatment. Factors such as aging, declining testosterone levels, medical illness, certain medications. and comorbid depressive illness can contribute to sexual dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction is one of the more common male sexual dysfunctions encountered in the clinical setting. Comorbidity between erectile dysfunction and depressive illness is high, but the causal relationship is unclear. The psychosocial distress that often accompanies erectile dysfunction might stimulate the development of depressive illness, or, as some data suggest, depression might cause erectile dysfunction. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between depression and erectile dysfunction, as well as the design of a new study that may provide some answers, and concludes that erectile dysfunction is a common, treatable condition that may cause or be the result of depression. Recent data suggest that sildenafil is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction in men with comorbid depression. Erectile dysfunction should be considered a multifactorial condition that may require a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, especially when depression is present.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction in Uremia",
      "abstract": "Disturbances in sexual function are a common feature of chronic renal failure. Approximately 50% of uremic men complain of erectile dysfunction while an even greater percentage of both men and women complain of decreased libido and a marked decline in the frequency of intercourse (1,2). The genesis of sexual dysfunction is multifactorial and is primarily organic in origin. In addition to the uremic milieu, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, and pharmacologic therapy all play an important role in the genesis of this problem. In addition, psychologic and physical stresses are also commonly present in this setting. Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men In men with chronic renal failure, disturbances in the pituitary-gonadal axis can be detected with only moderate reductions in the GFR and progressively worsen as the renal failure progresses. These disorders rarely normalize with initiation of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and, in fact, often progress. By comparison, a well-functioning renal transplant is much more likely to restore normal sexual activity, although some features of reproductive function may remain impaired (3). Testicular Function Chronic renal failure is associated with impaired spermatogenesis and testicular damage, often leading to infertility (4). Semen analysis typically shows a decreased volume of ejaculate, either low or complete azoospermia, and a low percentage of motility. These abnormalities are often apparent before the need for dialysis and then deteriorate further once dialytic therapy is initiated. Histologic changes in the testes include evidence of decreased spermatogenic activity with the greatest changes in the hormonally dependent later stages of spermatogenesis. The number of spermatocytes is reduced and there is little evidence of maturation to the stage of mature sperm. In most instances, the number of spermatogonia is normal but on occasion complete aplasia of germinal elements may also be present. Other findings include damage to the seminiferous tubules, interstitial fibrosis, and calcifications. Unlike other causes of severe primary testicular lesions, the Leydig and Sertoli cells show little evidence of hypertrophy or hyperplasia. This later finding suggests a defect in the hormonal regulation of the Leydig and Sertoli cells as might occur with either gonadotropin deficiency or resistance, rather than a cytotoxic effect of uremia where spermatogonia would be most affected (5). The factors responsible for testicular damage in uremia are not well understood. It is possible that plasticizers in dialysis tubing, such as phthalate, may play a role in propagating the abnormalities once patients begin maintenance hemodialysis. Sex Steroids In addition to impaired spermatogenesis, the testes also show evidence of impaired endocrine function. Total and free testosterone levels are typically reduced, although the binding capacity and concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin are normal (6,7,8). Acute stimulation of testosterone secretion with administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a compound with luteinizing hormone-like actions, produces only a blunted response in uremic men (9). Lower free testosterone levels and impaired Leydig cell sensitivity to HCG are first detectable with only moderate reductions in the GFR and before basal levels of testosterone fall. Recent studies have shown evidence of a factor in uremic serum capable of blocking the luteinizing hormone receptor, thus providing an explanation for the sluggish response of the Leydig cell to infusion of HCG (10). This blocking activity is inversely correlated with GFR and largely disappears after transplantation. Compared with testosterone, the total plasma estrogen concentration is often elevated in advanced renal failure (8). However, the physiologically important estradiol levels are typically in the normal range. As with the lack of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of Leydig cells, normal levels of estradiol suggest a functional gonadotropin deficiency or resistance in uremia because increased luteinizing hormone levels should enhance the testicular secretion of estradiol (5). Hypothalamic-Pituitary Function The plasma concentration of the pituitary gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone (LH), is elevated in uremic men (8). Elevated levels are found early in renal insufficiency and progressively rise with deteriorating renal function. The excess LH secretion in this setting is thought to result from the diminished release of testosterone from the Leydig cells, since testosterone normally leads to feedback inhibition of LH release. In addition, the metabolic clearance rate of LH is reduced as a result of decreased renal clearance. The increase in serum LH is variable and modest when compared to that observed in castrate nonuremic subjects. The lack of a more robust response of LH to low levels of circulating testosterone suggests a derangement in the central regulation of gonadotropin release. Infusion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) increases LH levels to the same degree as in healthy subjects; however, the peak value and return to baseline may be delayed (11,12). Since the kidney contributes importantly to the clearance of GnRH and LH, decreased metabolism of these hormones may explain the observed variations. The abnormal LH response to GnRH precedes and is not corrected by dialytic therapy. By contrast, renal transplantation returns the response of gonadotropins back to normal. In addition to decreased metabolism, subtle disturbances in LH secretion have also been described. Under normal circumstances, LH is secreted in a pulsatile manner. In uremic subjects, the number of secretory bursts remains normal but the amount of LH released per secretory burst is reduced (13). It is not known whether this decrease in amplitude is the result of a change in the pattern of GnRH release from the hypothalamus or a change in the responsiveness of the pituitary. In either case, the secretory pattern of LH returns to normal with the placement of a well-functioning allograft. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion is also increased in men with chronic renal failure, although to a more variable degree such that the LH/FSH ratio is typically increased. FSH release by the pituitary normally responds to feedback inhibition by a peptide product of the Sertoli cells called inhibin. The plasma FSH concentration tends to be highest in those uremic patients with the most severe damage to seminiferous tubules and presumably the lowest levels of inhibin. It has been suggested that increased FSH levels may portend a poor prognosis for recovery of spermatogenic function after renal transplantation (4,14). Clomiphene is a compound that acts by competing with estrogen or testosterone for receptors at the level of the hypothalamus and prevents the negative feedback of gonadal steroids on the release of GnRH and subsequently the release of pituitary gonadotropins. When administered to chronic renal failure patients, there is an appropriate rise in the levels of both LH and FSH, suggesting that the negative feedback control of testosterone on the hypothalamus is intact and that the storage and release of gonadotropins by the pituitary is normal (8). In summary, a number of observations suggest that gonadal failure is an important consequence of chronic renal failure. The finding that LH levels are typically increased is consistent with the presence of testicular damage. However, the lack of Leydig cell hypertrophy and normal estradiol levels also raise the possibility of functional hypogonadism. The finding that LH levels are only modestly increased in chronic renal failure suggests a diminished response of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to lowered testosterone levels and impaired regulation of gonadotropin secretion. One explanation for the blunted rise in LH in response to low levels of testosterone is that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in chronic renal failure is reset in such a way that it is more sensitive to the negative feedback inhibition of testosterone. In this manner, the axis begins to assume a similar characteristic as seen in the prepubertal state where there is extreme sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of gonadal steroids (5). Prolactin Metabolism Elevated plasma prolactin levels are commonly found in dialyzed men (15). Increased production is primarily responsible, since the kidney plays little, if any, role in the catabolism of this hormone. Prolactin release is normally under dopaminergic inhibitory control. Its secretion in chronic renal failure, however, appears autonomous and resistant to stimulatory or suppressive maneuvers. As an example, dopamine infusion or the administration of oral L-dopa fails to decrease basal prolactin levels. On the other hand, procedures that normally increase prolactin secretion such as arginine infusion, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, or thyrotropin-releasing hormone infusion elicit no response or only a blunted response. Again, these abnormalities resolve after a successful renal transplant. Increased prolactin secretion in chronic renal failure may be related in part to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. An infusion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in healthy men enhances prolactin release, a response that can be suppressed by the administration of L-dopa (16). Furthermore, partial inhibition of PTH release by the administration of calcitriol led in one study to an elevation in plasma testosterone levels, a reduction in plasma gonadotropin concentrations, and improved sexual function (17). However, this benefit could not be confirmed in a controlled trial of calcitriol therapy (18). Depletion of total body zinc stores may also play an etiologic role in uremic hyperprolactinemia (19). The clinical significance of enhanced prolactin release in uremic men is incompletely understood. Extreme hyperprolactinemia is associated with infertility, loss of libido, low circulating testosterone levels, and inappropriately low LH levels in men with normal renal function. These observations led to the evaluation of therapy with bromocryptine, which reduces prolactin secretion. Although it can lower prolactin levels to near normal in men with advanced renal disease, there has been an inconsistent effect on sexual potency and libido (15). In addition, a high incidence of side effects may be seen, particularly hypotension. Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occurs in approximately 30% of men on maintenance hemodialysis. This problem most often develops during the initial months of dialysis and then tends to regress as dialysis continues. The pathogenesis of gynecomastia in this setting is unclear. Although elevated prolactin levels and an increased estrogen-to-androgen ratio seem attractive possibilities, most data fail to support a primary role for abnormal hormonal function. Alternatively, a mechanism similar to that responsible for gynecomastia following refeeding of malnourished patients may be involved. Evaluation of Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men Sexual dysfunction can be manifest in several ways in uremic men. Perhaps the most common complaint the physician must address is that of impotence (Table 1). In evaluating and ultimately treating the impotent renal failure patient, one must not only consider disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis discussed above, but also abnormalities in the sympathetic nervous system and derangements in the arterial supply or venous drainage of the penis. In addition, the psychologic effects of a chronic illness and lifestyle limitations may have a negative impact on sexual function.Table 1: Factors involved in the pathogenesis of impotence in uremic menaA through history and physical can provide useful information during the initial evaluation of a patient with impotence. A history of normal erectile function before the development of renal failure suggests a secondary cause of impotence. Symptoms or physical findings of a neuropathy as in a patient with a neurogenic bladder would indicate a neurologic etiology. Similarly, symptoms or signs of peripheral vascular disease may be a clue to the presence of vascular obstruction to penile blood flow. One should look for the presence of secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial, axillary, and pubic hair. The lack of these findings and the presence of small soft testicles suggest primary or secondary hypogonadism as the cause of the impotence. Neurogenic and vascular causes are more likely to be associated with normalsized testicles. Even when the history and physical point to a specific abnormality, one must also consider that an individual patient may have more than one factor responsible for the erectile dysfunction and other causes may need to be ultimately evaluated. A review of the patient's medications may reveal a drug that could be responsible for impairing sexual function. Antihypertensive medications are common offenders, with centrally acting agents and beta blockers being the most commonly implicated agents in causing impotence. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are associated with a lower incidence of impotence and represent a useful alternative in renal failure patients with hypertension. Other drugs commonly implicated include cimetidine, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and metoclopramide. If the history and physical examination reveal no obvious cause, then a psychologic cause of erectile dysfunction may need to be considered. Testing for the presence of nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) has been done in some centers as a means to discriminate between a psychologic and organic cause of impotence. The basis for this test is that during the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, males normally have an erection. The assumption is that a man with a psychologic cause of impotence would still experience erections while asleep, whereas the absence of an adequate erection would make an organic cause more likely. If a patient is found to have nocturnal erections, then psychologic testing and evaluation is indicated. It should be noted that NPT testing is not infallible and that if a patient has a normal test and no psychologic cause is found then evaluation for an organic cause should still be pursued. Primary depression may affect sexual function and lead to reduced libido and decreased frequency of intercourse. As a result, it has been suggested that depression may play a role in the genesis of sexual dysfunction in chronic renal failure patients. Studies addressing this issue have produced conflicting results. Procci et al. found no association between the presence or absence of depression and measures of sexual function such as frequency of intercourse or ability to develop an erection as determined by NPT testing (1). In a more recent study, Steele et al. surveyed a randomly selected group of 68 peritoneal dialysis patients that included both men and women and found that 63% of patients reported never having intercourse, 19% had intercourse less than or equal to two times per month, and 18% had intercourse more than two times per month (20). In this study, standard psychologic questionnaires indicated that the patients who never had intercourse were more depressed and anxious, and assessed their overall quality of life at a level that was significantly lower than that of the other two groups. Thus, subclinical depression may be underrated as a contributory cause of sexual dysfunction in both uremic men and women. It is also likely that mental symptoms of fatigue and listlessness associated with the treatment of end-stage renal disease are also major factors in this problem (2). There are tests that may aid in the discrimination between a neurogenic and a vascular cause of impotence. Tests performed to exclude a vascular etiology of impotence include Doppler studies to measure penile blood flow, measurement of penile BP, and penile pulse palpation. Neurogenic impotence is suggested by detecting a prolonged latency time of the bulbocavernous reflex or confirming the presence of a neurogenic bladder. With the availability of sildenafil (see below) to use in a therapeutic trial, such tests are generally reserved for nonresponders who may eventually be considered for surgical placement of a penile prosthesis. As discussed previously, hormonal abnormalities are frequently detected in chronic renal failure patients. Endocrine tests that are useful in the evaluation of an organic cause of impotence include measurement of serum LH, FSH, testosterone, and prolactin levels. It should be noted that only a small percentage of uremic patients will have prolactin levels >100 ng/ml. Imaging studies of the hypothalamic-pituitary region should be performed in patients with levels of greater magnitude to exclude the presence of a microadenoma or macroadenoma. Treatment of Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Men The treatment of sexual dysfunction in uremic men is initially of a general nature (Figure 1). One needs to ensure optimal delivery of dialysis and adequate nutritional intake. Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin has been shown to enhance sexual function in chronic renal failure. It is likely that the associated improvement in well-being that comes with the correction of anemia probably plays an important role in this response. In some studies, erythropoietin therapy has been reported to cause normalization of the pituitary gonadal feedback mechanism with reduced plasma concentrations of LH and FSH and increases in plasma testosterone levels (21,22). Reductions in elevated plasma prolactin levels have also been noted (23). It is controversial as to whether these endocrinologic changes are solely the result of correction of the anemia or a direct effect of erythropoietin. As mentioned previously, controlling the degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism with 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D may be of benefit in lowering prolactin levels and improving sexual function in some patients.Figure 1.: Approach to sexual dysfunction in uremic men.Patients with normal NPT testing should be evaluated to determine whether there is a psychologic component to the impotence. If a problem is found then a trial of psychotherapy is warranted. The effectiveness of antidepressant medications and/or psychiatric counseling in chronic renal failure patients with sexual dysfunction has not been well studied. In patients with a neurogenic or vascular cause of impotence, therapeutic options include intracavernous injection of alprostadil (synthetic PGE1), use of vacuum/constriction devices, or urethral suppositories containing alprostadil. Surgical placement of a penile prosthesis is typically considered in patients who fail the less invasive first-line treatments. With the recent approval of sildenafil for the treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, many physicians now utilize this agent as the first-line therapy for patients with psychogenic, vascular, or neurogenic causes of impotence. There have been no published studies to date specifically addressing the effectiveness and safety of sildenafil in chronic renal failure patients. However, anecdotally the drug appears effective in such patients. Since the majority of patients receiving renal replacement therapy in the United States are diabetic, it is noteworthy that a recently published randomized controlled trial found that sildenafil was both effective and well tolerated in diabetic men with erectile dysfunction (24). More than 95% of the patients in this study were believed to have either a neurogenic or vascular etiology of erectile dysfunction. Whether diabetic patients with renal disease will experience a similar benefit is not known. It should be emphasized that sildinafil is contraindicated in patients who are currently taking organic nitrates. Caution should also be exercised when prescribing this agent to patients with known coronary artery disease. In patients with low circulating levels of testosterone, correcting the deficit generally results in clinical improvement in other forms of gonadal failure. By contrast, administration of testosterone to uremic men usually fails to restore libido or potency, despite increased testosterone levels and reduced release of LH and FSH (25,26). In a recent report of 27 male dialysis patients with biochemically proven hypogonadism, administration of depot testosterone fully restored sexual function in only three patients (27). In those patients unresponsive to medical therapy, use of a vacuum tumescence device completely corrected penile erection dysfunction in the majority of cases. In a hypogonadal patient whose primary complaint is decreased libido, a trial of testosterone may be warranted. In very limited studies, administration of clomiphene citrate has also been reported to cause a normalization of plasma testosterone levels associated with some improvement in sexual function. Patients found to have increased circulating levels of prolactin may benefit from a trial of bromocryptine. This agent is a dopaminergic agonist that has shown some efficacy in improving sexual function presumably by reducing elevated prolactin levels. However, its usefulness has been limited by a relatively high frequency of side effects. Other dopaminergic agonists, such as parlodel and lisuride, seem to be better tolerated but have only been used in small short-term studies. Zinc deficiency has also been suggested as a cause of gonadal failure. Uremic patients are often deficient in zinc, probably due to reduced dietary intake, zinc malabsorption, and/or possible leaching of zinc by dialysis equipment. In a controlled trial, supplemental zinc resulted in significant increases in the plasma testosterone concentration and sperm counts, as well as significant declines in LH and FSH levels compared with a control group (28). Potency, libido, and frequency of inter-course also improved in those patients given zinc. It is possible that normalization of total body zinc may also be effective in correcting uremic hyperprolactinemia (19). Thus, the aggregate data suggest that the administration of zinc in a zinc-deficient man is a reasonable therapeutic option. Sexual Dysfunction in Uremic Women Disturbances in menstruation and fertility are commonly encountered in women with chronic renal failure, usually leading to amenorrhea by the time the patient reaches end-stage renal disease. The menstrual cycle typically remains irregular with scanty flow after the initiation of maintenance dialysis, although normal menses is restored in some women (29). In others, hypermenorrhagia develops, potentially leading to significant blood loss and increased transfusion requirements. The major menstrual abnormality in uremic women is anovulation, with affected patients being infertile (30). Women on chronic dialysis also tend to complain of decreased libido and reduced ability to reach orgasm (2,20). Pregnancy can rarely occur in advanced renal failure, but fetal wastage is markedly increased. Some residual renal function is usually present in the infrequent pregnancy that can be carried to term. The subject of pregnancy in chronic renal insufficiency has recently been reviewed (31). Normal Menstrual Cycle The normal menstrual cycle is divided into a follicular or proliferative phase and a luteal or secretory phase. Normal follicular maturation and subsequent ovulation require appropriately timed secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins. FSH secretion exhibits typical negative feedback, with hormone levels falling as the plasma estrogen concentration rises. In contrast, LH secretion is suppressed maximally by low concentrations of estrogen but exhibits positive feedback control in response to a rising and sustained elevation of estradiol. Thus, high levels of estradiol in the late follicular phase trigger a surging elevation in LH secretion, which is responsible for ovulation. After ovulation, progesterone levels increase due to production by the corpus luteum. Progesterone is responsible for the transformation of the endometrium into the luteal phase. Hormonal Disturbances in Uremic Premenopausal Women Indirect determination of ovulation suggests that anovulatory cycles are the rule in uremic women (32). For example, endometrial biopsies show an absence of progestational effects, and there is a failure to increase basal body temperature at the time when ovulation would be expected. In addition, the preovulatory peak in LH and estradiol concentrations is frequently absent. The failure of LH to rise in part reflects a disturbance in the positive estradiol feedback pathway, since the administration of exogenous estrogen to mimic the preovulatory surge in estradiol fails to stimulate LH release (32). In contrast, feedback inhibition of gonadotropin release by low doses of estradiol remains intact. This can be illustrated by the ability of the antiestrogen clomiphene to enhance LH and FSH secretion. It remains unclear whether the disturbances in cyclic gonadotropin production originate in the hypothalamus (via impaired production of GnRH) or in the anterior pituitary (30). It is possible, for example, that endorphins are involved. Circulating endorphin levels are increased in chronic renal failure due primarily to reduced renal opioid clearance, and endorphins can inhibit ovulation, perhaps by reducing the release of GnRH. Prolactin and Galactorrhea Women with chronic renal failure commonly have elevated circulating prolactin levels. As in men with chronic renal failure, the hypersecretion of prolactin in this setting appears to be autonomous, as it is resistant to maneuvers designed to stimulate or inhibit its release. It has been suggested that the elevated prolactin levels may impair hypothalamic-pituitary function and contribute to sexual dysfunction and galactorrhea in these patients. It is of interest in this regard that nonuremic women with prolactin-producing pituitary tumors commonly present with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and low circulating gonadotropin levels. However, uremic women treated with bromocryptine rarely resume normal menses and continue to complain of galactorrhea (if present), despite normalization of the plasma prolactin concentration (32). Thus, factors other than hyperprolactinemia must be important in this setting. Hormonal Disturbances in Uremic Postmenopausal Women Postmenopausal uremic women have gonadotropin levels as high as those seen in nonuremic women of similar age (32,33). This observation is consistent with the finding mentioned above in premenopausal women that negative feedback inhibition of estrogen on LH and FSH release is intact in uremia. However, the age at which menopause begins in chronic renal failure tends to be decreased when compared to healthy women. Treatment The high frequency of anovulation leads sequentially to lack of formation of the corpus luteum and failure of progesterone secretion. Because progesterone is responsible for transforming the endometrium into the luteal phase, lack of progesterone is associated with amenorrhea. For patients who desire to resume menses, administration of a progestational agent during the final days of the monthly cycle will usually be successful. On the other hand, ongoing menses can contribute significantly to the anemia of chronic renal disease, particularly in those patients with hypermenorrhagia. In this setting, administration of a progestational agent during the entire monthly cycle will terminate menstrual flow. Rarely, a patient may require hysterectomy for refractory uterine bleeding. It is not known whether the usual absence of menses in women with chronic renal failure predisposes to the development of endometrial hyperplasia and possible carcinoma. Since these patients are often anovulatory, there is no disruption of the proliferative effect of estrogen by the release of progesterone. It is therefore recommended that women with chronic renal failure be monitored closely by a gynecologist; it may be desirable in at least some patients to administer a progestational agent several times per year to interrupt the proliferation induced by unopposed estrogen release (Figure 2).Figure 2.: Approach to sexual dysfunction in uremic women.Although pregnancy can rarely occur in women on chronic dialysis, restoration of fertility as a therapeutic goal should be discouraged. In comparison, the abnormalities in ovulation can usually be reversed and successful pregnancy achieved in women with a well-functioning renal transplant. Uremic women who are menstruating normally should be encouraged to use birth control. Studies addressing the therapy of decreased libido and sexual function in uremic women are lacking. Amenorrheic hemodialysis patients may have low estradiol levels that can secondarily lead to vaginal atrophy and dryness and result in discomfort during intercourse. Such patients may benefit from local estrogen therapy or vaginal lubricants. Low dose testosterone may be effective in increasing sexual desire but is rarely used secondary to potential toxicity. Bromocryptine therapy in hyperprolactinemic patients may help in restoring sexual function but has not been well studied. Estrogen supplementation may improve sexual function in those patients with low circulating estradiol levels. Successful transplantation is clearly the most effective means to restore normal sexual desire in women with chronic renal failure (2). Summary In summary, sexual dysfunction is a common finding in both men and women with chronic renal failure. Common disturbances include erectile dysfunction in men, menstrual abnormalities in women, and decreased libido and fertility in both sexes. These abnormalities are primarily organic in nature and are related to uremia as well as the other comorbid conditions that frequently accompany the chronic renal failure patient. Fatigue and psychosocial factors related to the presence of a chronic disease are also contributory factors. Disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can be detected before the need for dialysis but continue to worsen once dialytic therapy is initiated. Impaired gonadal function is prominent in uremic men, whereas the disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are more subtle. By contrast, central disturbances are more prominent in uremic women. Therapy is initially directed toward optimizing the delivery of dialysis, correcting anemia with recombinant erythropoietin, and controlling the degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism with vitamin D. For many practicing nephrologists, sildenafil has become the first-line therapy in the treatment of impotence. In the hypogonadal man whose only complaint is decreased libido, testosterone may be of benefit. Regular gynecologic follow-up is required in uremic women to guard against potential complications of unopposed estrogen effect. Uremic women should be advised against pregnancy while on dialysis. Successful transplantation is the most effective means of restoring normal sexual function in both men and women with chronic renal failure.",

      "abstract": "Sexual problems that are psychological in origin, rather than physiological, are called psychosexual disorders. Multiple factors, such as general health of the patient, chronic illnesses, psychiatric/psychological disorders, and socio-cultural factors, alone or in combination can be attributed to the development of psychosexual dysfunctions. The symptoms of these disorders vary for each individual and differ with gender. These disorders may be categorized as sexual dysfunction, paraphilias, and gender identity disorders. Dermatologists are sometimes consulted for sexual dysfunctions in their routine practice by the patients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics because a majority of the patients believe that these problems are caused by dysfunctions in the sex organs, and because people are hesitant to go to sexuality clinics and psychiatrists for such problems. Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them. Dermatologists should understand basic sexual medicine and ask patients for sexual problems. They should be trained to manage such patients accordingly. In this review, we will be focusing on sexual dysfunctions, their etiopathogenesis, and management from a dermatologist's perspective.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "La comorbidité psychiatrique est la règle plutôt que l’exception dans le cadre de la dépression majeure. 60 à 70 % des patients déprimés présentent au moins une comorbidité psychiatrique, et 30 à 40 % en ont au moins deux. Les comorbidités les plus fréquemment retrouvées sont les pathologies anxieuses, les addictions, et certains troubles ou traits de personnalité (borderline, neuroticisme) [1]. La présence de telles comorbidités compromet le pronostic de la maladie dépressive, avec une diminution des taux de rémission et de réponse aux traitements, un allongement du délai d’action, un tableau clinique plus sévère, une altération du fonctionnement et une chronicisation. Les comorbidités psychiatriques sont considérées comme un des facteurs participant à la résistance thérapeutique pour 20 à 30 % des épisodes [2]. Cette absence de réponse pourrait être plus particulièrement associée à certains sous-types et phénotypes cliniques de dépression poussant alors à la recherche de biomarqueurs spécifiques (électrophysiologiques, anatomiques et fonctionnels, métaboliques, et génétiques) de chacune de ces formes cliniques afin d’améliorer la compréhension même de la pathologie et son pronostic [3]. Par ailleurs, les recommandations ne définissent pas de stratégies précises en cas de dépressions avec comorbidités psychiatriques, les études randomisées, contrôlées classiquement menées ayant généralement tendance à exclure ces patients, et notamment ceux présentant une addiction associée. Il est néanmoins possible que le traitement de la dépression puisse améliorer le trouble comorbide, comme en témoigne la place aujourd’hui occupée par les antidépresseurs dans la pharmacothérapie des troubles anxieux [4]. Ces données soulèvent des questions cliniques, thérapeutiques et de recherche importantes, centrées sur une meilleure identification des facteurs de risque de la résistance en abordant le problème central de la comorbidité psychiatrique qu’il est essentiel de repérer dans le cadre d’une prise en charge globale du patient déprimé.",

The recovery of speech seems to follow, with a slower rhythm, the stages of acquisition of the speech in the normal subject. 2) Diversely from other cases of the literature, no positive correlation exists between the gravity of the aphasic syndrome and that of the EEG anomaly: they have worsened while the disturbance of the speech have partially regressed.",

If so can an augmentation of the support package or environment, or a specific psychological intervention, resolve or substantially improve the situation? If conservative measures and non pharmacological interventions have not been successful, is the problem severe enough to merit a trial of pharmacotherapy? For most of the BPSD considered in this chapter, there is very little evidence pertaining to treatment intervention, other than some notable trials of non-pharmacological approaches for the treatment of abnormal vocalizations. The potential side effects and consequences of drug interventions, particularly with neuroleptic agents, have been highlighted elsewhere (Chapter 15), but are particularly important when considering the absence of any adequate clinical trials.",

      "title": "Management of sexual side effects of antidepressant therapy.",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction occurs in over one third of the general population and has many causes, including psychosocial factors, general medical illness, nonpsychiatric medication, psychiatric disorders, and psychotropic medications. Psychosocial causes are the most prevalent, but many frequently used medications, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, and H2-blockers, can also cause sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunctions occur in many psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders. In addition, over half the patients with major depression will have some sexual dysfunction. Although much attention has been paid to sexual dysfunction associated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), many other commonly used psychotropics are associated with a variety of sexual dysfunction, including haloperidol, benzodiazepines, stimulants, and drugs of abuse. With regard to SSRIs, sexual dysfunction occurs in 50% or more of such patients, which is substantially higher than the rates reported in the Physicians' Desk Reference. The reason for this discrepancy is that patients will not spontaneously report sexual problems and must be questioned about such problems directly. A variety of strategies exist to manage antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, including waiting, reducing the antidepressant dose, use of drug holidays, use of adjunctive pharmacotherapy, and switching antidepressants. Use of an antidepressant with a low prevalence of sexual side effects, such as bupropion, nefazodone, and mirtazapine, may also be considered.",

The causes of neurological deterioration after spinal cord injury are not well studied. Neurologic deterioration of acute, subacute, or chronic periods was reported in 2–10% of patients with cervical cord injuries and in 15% of patients with entire spinal cord injuries. Many patients with neurologically deterioration with spinal cord injuries are associated with surgical intervention: epidural hematoma not evacuated, attempted reduction of kyphosis, or intraoperative injury. Additional neurological deterioration may occur after several years, although it may occur in the initial weeks or months after spinal cord injury. It can have a serious negative impact on functional abilities and may lead to anxiety about further loss of functional independence and deterioration of function after adjustment to spinal cord injury. This chapter describes the relatively less rare causes of neurological deterioration that are reported or expected in patients with spinal cord injuries.",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

      "title": "Perimenopausal Mental Disorders: Epidemiology and Phenomenology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Perimenopause, the interval of irregular menstrual activity which directly precedes menopause, is characterized by widely fluctuating hormone levels amidst a large-scale decline in circulating estrogen. This phase in a woman's life is typically accompanied by physical discomforts including vasomotor symptoms, such as headaches, insomnia, and hot flushes, as well as genital atrophy. Not surprisingly, studies suggest a significant increase in mood lability for women during this time. While some evidence points toward an exacerbation of bipolar mood symptoms and an increase in schizophrenic psychosis during perimenopause, the majority of research conducted on perimenopausal mental disorders has focused on unipolar depression. Studies vary widely in methodology, definitions of menopausal status, and degrees of depression among subjects; however, the majority of findings indicate an increased susceptibility to depression during the perimenopausal transition. This greater susceptibility may be due to neuroendocrine effects of declining estrogen levels, the subjective experience of somatic symptoms resulting from this hormonal decline, and/or the more frequent occurrence of “exit” or “loss” events for women during this stage of life. At this time, more research is needed to address questions of prevalence, risk, and etiology for depression and other major mental disorders as related to the physiological and psychosocial changes associated with perimenopause.",

      "title": "Relationship between Postpartum Depression, Infant Temperament and Childcare Stress in Tirana, Albania",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe postpartum period represents one of the most important life stages of women in which the accurate detection and treatment of psychological distress is required. Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a depression episode that begins within six months after birth and matches the criteria of DSM - IV for major depression without psychotic consequences (1). The prevalence of PPD is about 8-35% depending on the method used for evaluation (2). PPD occurs when there is an increase in demands on a new mother due to the child development.Many different risk factors have been found to be at least moderately correlated with the presence of postpartum depression (3). These risk factors include a history of depression (preconception or prenatal), high stress level, high anxiety, and little or no social support. Although no single factor can be attributed to predicting postpartum depression, the combination of factors does seem very important in understanding both the short and long term outcomes as well as what strategies might be best for intervention.Characteristic symptoms of PPD are similar to those of major depression including: sadness, despair, anxiety, compulsive thoughts, and appetite and sleep disturbances. A new mother with PPD may also have thoughts of harming herself and/or her infant (4). In addition to directly affecting a new mother's mental health, PPD can interfere with a mother's ability to recognize and respond to the needs of her infant, increasing the risk for delays in infant development and behavioral problems in childhood (5). Consequently, PPD is considered a major form of depression which requires treatment and identification of women who may be at an increased risk. Lack of diagnosis of PPD can affect the mother, her child, family members, and society through medical expense, social dysfunction, illness, and even death (6).Postpartum depression and child characteristicsVarious studies have reported that child related factors were associated with postpartum depression. Cutrona (7) reported that high levels of child care related stressors were associated with high levels of depressive symptomatology, while Hopkins, Campbell and Marcus (8) found that having a difficult baby, or a baby with neonatal complications, was associated with a diagnosis of postpartum depression.Beck (9) studied two variables related to the infant; child temperament and childcare stress. She found that childcare stress and having an infant with a difficult temperament were moderately predictive of postpartum depressive symptomatology. It has been found that mothers suffering from postpartum depression give more negative descriptions of their children and report more behavioral problems in their infants, than control mothers (10). Therefore, the mothers' symptoms may be a source of bias in the reporting of infant characteristics.The early postpartum period is a time of potential stress for the mother as she assumes increasing responsibility in the parenting role (11,12). Symptoms of depressed mood emerge and occur more frequently during this stage (12). Since infant behavioral patterns also take shape early, it is possible that difficult temperament may either influence or be influenced by the maternal psychological state at this early postpartum stage (9,13,14).In this study the relationship between infant temperament, child care stress and postpartum depression during the first year postpartum is assessed. Temperament refers to individual differences in an infant's expressions of arousal and emotion and describes infant self-regulation, reactivity, and modulation (15). Emerging temperamental difficulty may affect maternal interactions with the infant and may shape her future expectations of the child, potentially posing a stress upon the parent-infant relationship (16). Child care stress refers to the mother's perception of infant health problems, problems with baby feeding and problems related to baby sleep. …",

      "abstract": "To correctly diagnose occupational asbestos-related disease, a specialist in occupational health has to answer a set of questions: (A) is the asbestos-related disease diagnosed by a specialist in pulmonology with the help of a radiologist and cardiologist occupational or non-occupational; (B) is the occupational asbestos-related disease caused by more than one source of asbestos dust, and, if it is, to what has of each of these sources contributed to the development of the disease; (C) how many functional disorders and symptoms (pulmonary, cardiac, chest pain, reactive fear from death, reactive psychoneurotic disorder in which fear is not the main symptom) has occupational asbestos-related disease produced and to what degree; (D) have these disorders and symptoms permanently reduced patient's work ability, and, if they have, can we speak of work disability; (E) have these disorders permanently reduced vital activity, and, if they have, can we speak of vital disability; and (F) does the patient suffer mental pain because of reduced vital activity, and if he does, what sort of pain. This approach should assume the form and content of an expert specialist opinion, that is, of a legal medical expertise and should rely on a more extensive medical and non-medical documentation than the one serving for therapeutic purposes. As such methodological approach is rarely met in practice, we have proposed a model that includes evaluation of cumulative exposure to asbestos dust, determination of work and vital disability, and evaluation of mental pain. This method stems from our long-time practice and experience with patients suffering from asbestos-related diseases, including the experience acquired since 2002 from cooperation with the Reference Centre for Asbestosis and Other Asbestos-Related Diseases of the Croatian Ministry of Health at the Department for Pulmonary Diseases of the Clinical Hospital Split.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Noncompliance with maintenance treatments for chronic illnesses such as schizophrenia and affective disorders can exceed 50%, Poor adherence can be due to drug-related factors (tolerance, complexity of prescription, side effects, or cost), patient-related variables (illness symptoms, comorbidity, insight capacity, belief system, or sociocultural environment), and physician-related factors (communication or psychoeducational style). Psychosocial treatments must be used in conjunction with medication during the maintenance phase to improve adherence to treatment and to achieve - through the management of psychological variables - better social, work, and family functioning.

      "abstract": "Objective: There are several kinds of male genital pain which can cause mental suffering. Usually, they emerge during ordinary urological or andrological examinations. These distresses, sine materia, can be divided into different groups. Design and Method: The first group, which is the most frequent one, mainly affects the testicles; usually, this kind of distress last all life and it is often associated with surgery and/or frequent examinations to the genitals during childhood. The second group encompasses cases of real penodinia: the patients express their discomfort especially uncovering the glan and, for this reason, this action is never done. This distress is not always referred to as pain, but more often as bothersome. Sexual intercourses are permitted. Often the patients undergo a circumcision that usually has a complicated postoperative course. The males of the third group correspond to the women suffering from vaginismus. The patients do not even tolerate the approach of the hand to the penis and they make the same actions and the same movements as the vaginismic women. The patients are unable to have sex. This phenomenon is rare. In a perspective of multi-disciplinary and integrated methodology, the patients were treated with traditional surgery and/or with administration of drugs and/or with sexual therapy according with the integrated Kaplan method and/or with techniques for the rehabilitation of the pelvic floor. Results: Some clinical cases will be presented and discussed. Conclusions: The Authors describe new categories of male genital pain, never defined before, similar to Vulvodynia or Vaginism in women.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of ramelteon for residual sleep disturbances (hypersomnia) in a patient with premenstrual dysphoric disorder",
      "abstract": "One of the characteristic symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is sleep disturbance before menstruation, mainly involving hypersomnia, and insomnia can occur in some cases. In most PMDD patients, the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) leads to rapid resolution of symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, and affective lability. However, premenstrual sleep disturbances, such as hypersomnia and insomnia, may persist. I encountered a case in which ramelteon was effective for the treatment of residual sleep disturbances (hypersomnia) that persisted in a patient with PMDD even after SSRI therapy. Herein, I present my experience with this patient. The patient was a 29-year-old woman with a 4-year history of PMDD and no physical complications. Her menstrual cycle was 28 days in length. For 10 days before menstruation, she experienced symptoms such as marked affective lability, marked irritability and anger, marked depressed mood, marked anxiety and tension, decreased interest in usual activities, lethargy, marked lack of energy, cravings for sweet foods, excessive daytime sleepiness, and frequent nocturnal awakenings. Although most of her premenstrual symptoms showed resolution with an intermittent dosing regimen of escitalopram at 20 mg/day, the excessive daytime sleepiness and frequent nocturnal awakenings persisted from days 7 to 1 before menstruation began, disrupting her daily activities during this period. She expressed a strong desire for improvement in these premenstrual sleep problems. With the aim of ameliorating the frequent nocturnal awakenings, ramelteon was additionally administered at a dose of 8 mg/day at bedtime during the luteal phase only, which resulted in complete resolution of not only the frequent nocturnal awakenings, but also the excessive daytime sleepiness during her subsequent menstrual cycle. She gave informed consent for the publication of this description, and her anonymity has been preserved. I experienced a case of PMDD that responded favorably to additional administration of ramelteon. Many patients with PMDD experience premenstrual hypersomnia and insomnia, and they often do not respond adequately to SSRI. Ramelteon is a selective melatonin MT1/MT2 receptor agonist. Some studies have shown that melatonin function is lower during the luteal phase in patients with PMDD than during the follicular phase in patients with PMDD or during the luteal phase in healthy women.1, 2 As a melatonin receptor agonist, ramelteon compensated for the decrease in melatonin function during the luteal phase in the present patient with PMDD, ameliorating both her frequent nocturnal awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness. Although the symptoms of PMDD are thought to be associated with abnormal functioning of the serotonergic system, my experience suggests that melatonin may also play a role in sleep-related symptoms such as hypersomnia and insomnia.

The most typical symptoms fall into four categories, encompassing intrusive memories (e.g., periodic distressing reminders of the traumatic episode), avoidance behaviors (avoidance of people or places reminiscent of the traumatic episode), negative changes in thinking and mood, along with changes in physical and emotional responses (i.e., arousal symptoms).[1] The historical epidemiology of PTSD suggests that between 5 and 10% of the general population may be affected by this condition at some point in their lives,[2] although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has contributed to significantly increase the prevalence of PTSD, with almost 20% of COVID-19-discharged patients showing symptoms.[3] Given this concerning epidemiology, the search for effective treatment options for patients with PTSD has become increasingly important in recent years. Among the various agents that have been proposed, heparin represents an intriguing perspective.",

      "abstract": "Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) is a newly recognized condition of uncertain etiology with limited data on successful treatment. It best can be described as persistent physiological arousal in the absence of conscious feelings of sexual desire. PGAD consists of extended periods of sexual excitement that neither diminish on their own nor resolve with ordinary orgasmic experiences. The arousal is distressing, unwanted, and often painful. The majority of PGAD cases have been identified in women. Although the disorder can occur in men, there is no data on prevalence in men and little is known about whether or not there a common etiology is shared with female cases of PGAD. The chapter ends by discussing several possible etiologies and four main treatment options.",

      "title": "Spastic Paraplegia 3A",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Spastic paraplegia 3A (SPG3A; also known as ATL1-HSP) is characterized by progressive bilateral and mostly symmetric spasticity and weakness of the legs. Compared to other forms of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), in which diminished vibration sense (caused by degeneration of the corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns) and urinary bladder hyperactivity are present in all affected individuals, these findings occur in a minority of individuals with SPG3A. The average age of onset is four years. More than 80% of reported individuals manifest spastic gait before the end of the first decade of life. Most persons with early-onset ATL1-HSP have a pure (uncomplicated) HSP; however, complicated HSP with axonal motor neuropathy and/or distal amyotrophy with lower motor neuron involvement (Silver syndrome phenotype) have been observed. The rate of progression in ATL1-HSP is slow, and wheelchair dependency or need for a walking aid (cane, walker, or wheelchair) is relatively rare. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ATL1-HSP is established in a proband with suggestive findings and almost exclusively a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATL1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Note: The exceptions are two families with biallelic ATL1 pathogenic variants. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Medical treatment of spasticity may begin with oral baclofen or tizanidine, followed by chemodenervation with botulinum A or B toxins if oral antispasticity medications are not tolerated. Intrathecal baclofen pump may be considered for those who improve on oral baclofen but have significant systemic adverse effects. Medical therapy should be combined with intensive physical therapy focused on stretching and strengthening exercises that may help delay or minimize muscle tendon contractures, scoliosis, and foot deformities. Distal weakness (typically affecting foot dorsiflexion) can be ameliorated by ankle-foot orthoses. Urinary urgency can be treated with anticholinergic antispasmodic drugs. Surveillance: No consensus exists regarding the frequency of clinical follow-up visits, but reevaluation once or twice yearly to identify and treat new complications is recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dantrolene, as it can induce irreversible weakness, adversely affecting mobility. Genetic counseling ATL1-HSP is almost exclusively inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. More than 95% of individuals diagnosed with SPG3A have an affected parent; the proportion of individuals with ATL1-HSP caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is currently unknown. Each child of an individual with ATL1-HSP has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the ATL1 pathogenic variant has been identified in a family member with autosomal dominant ATL1-HSP, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "A PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH TO SEXUALLY DEVIANT BEHAVIOR IN THE COMMUNITY",
      "abstract": "Many varieties of psychiatric and psychological treatment have been touted as effective for the paraphilias, which are disorders of sexual behavior requiring unusual or bizarre imagery or acts for sexual excitement. Hormonal alteration of sexual arousal with anti-androgens, particularly Medroxyprogesterone Acetate {MPA), has gained popularity in the last two decades. MPA results in a reversible, dose-dependent reduction in plasma testosterone, with a concomitant reduction in sexual fantasy, arousal, and per formance. Side effects and complications are minimal. Medication is one component in a comprehensive treatment plan which is designed to deal with the patient's medical, social, family, and psychological problems. Implications of the paraphilias and their treatment for the family are discussed. The mental health professional may be confronted at times with sexual problems which have social and legal ramifications as well as clinical ones. Among the most challenging of such sexual problems to treat are the paraphilias. After a referral of the paraphiliac patient to the mental health professional occurs, a decision must be made about what form of treatment can be offered to the patient. Consideration must also be given to prevention of recurrence of the presenting sexual problem. Medroxy progesterone acetate is one possible treatment for the paraphilias which has been gaining in popularity in recent years. Generally there has been little sociological interest in the paraphilias and their treatment despite obvious profound and disruptive effects upon marriage and the family.",

Such individuals suffer from chronic depression which may or may not be masked, but which permeates their character. Although the condition is among the commonest seen in many of our clinics and practices, it remains without a generally accepted diagnostic form. It is suggested that the essential, clinical, dynamic, and structural features of the depressive character are: (1) consistently low self-esteem and a sense of helplessness, dependent object relations and chronic guilt; (2) self-directed aggression and masochism are frequent but not invariable; (3) extensive use of the mechanism of denial is as common as the previously described obsessional defenses seen in patients subject to psychotic depression; (4) often the depressive character suffers from intense oral envy; (5) depressive character traits may help to ward off any of the basic anxieties, namely, object loss, loss of love, castration anxiety, and superego anxiety (guilt) (6) the depressive character may be similar to a number of related disorders, namely, the obsessional character, hysterical characters with a large oral component, and depressive borderline states; (7) sensitivity to loss, sadness, and fragility of self-esteem makes the depressive character especially vulnerable to regression into overt depression; (8) the persistence of oral incorporative mechanisms, ambivalent, dependent object relations, ego versus superego tension with depressive affect, and sensitivity to loss are characteristic of the ego of the depressive character.",

      "title": "Estudio de los síntomas somáticos asociados a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una población de atención primaria",
      "abstract": "Es conocida la elevada frecuencia de los trastornos mentales y psicosociales en la poblacion general y en la poblacion atendida en el ambito de la atencion primaria de salud. Los estudios epidemiologicos demuestran que existe una alta morbilidad psiquiatrica en la practica medica general ya que los pacientes buscan ayuda principalmente en el primer escalon del sistema oficial de atencion de salud. Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

Primitive reflexes develop in the womb, are present at birth in the full-term neonate. Postural reflexes emerge after birth and take up to three and a half years to be fully developed. Collectively, abnormality in the profile of these two groups of reflexes provides indications of neurological dysfunction or neurological immaturity. Spinal reflexes function at the base of the hierarchical control system. A weak or absent Moro reflex is seen in cases of upper motor neuron lesions; an asymmetrical Moro reflex at birth may indicate a fractured clavicle or an Erb's palsy. The fear paralysis reflex is a highly alert but immobile state involving one or several following physical changes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction We present the first mnemonic method in Portuguese, “RISADA PEGA”, for alarm criteria in emergency headaches in order to facilitate their identification and diagnosis. A search was made through different databases for a mnemonic method regarding alarm criteria in emergency headaches, and methods in English and Spanish were found, but there was no mention of one written in Portuguese. Result With that in mind, the method “RISADA PEGA” (“laughter spreads”, in English) was created: Repentina / (Sudden) I - Início depois dos 50 anos / (onset in a patient older than 50) S - Sinais e/ou sintomas de doenças sistêmicas ou neurológicas / (Signs and/or symptoms of systemic or neurologic diseases) A - Anormalidades no exame neurológico/(abnormalities upon neurologic examination) D - Depressão da imunidade(AIDS, Câncer)/Depressed immunity (HIV or cancer) A - Antecedentes: doenças que podem acometer o SNC; número de vindas ao PShistória familiar de cefaleia)/(Prior conditions: diseases affecting the central nervous system; number of visits to the health center, history of headache in the family) P - Padrão alterado (mudança no padrão anterior da cefaleia)/(change in headache pattern) E - Esforço/exertion) G - Gravidez/(pregnancy) A - Autonomia (sinais autonômicos)/(autonomic signs) Conclusion In the emergency department, an acute headache is a symptom presented by 2%-4% of admitted patients. Secondary headaches are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A need exists for the quick identification of the alarm criteria and a correct stratification of the patient's risk, proper diagnosis and treatment. There are also time constraints in the emergency department. This shows the usefulness of a method for quick identification of the alarm criteria. We believe this is a useful tool for medical education and a clinical aid for clinical practitioners, it may also be a way to educate patients regarding the alarm criteria for emergency headaches.",

      "title": "Il trattamento a lungo termine della Depressione Unipolare: focus sulla terapia con Venlafaxina RP",
      "abstract": "Depression is the most common of all the major mental illnesses with one year prevalence in European countries of around 5%, and with a range from 3.1% to 10.1%. Depressive Episodes are associated with disability and frequently have a long duration: in one third of patients the episode will last for more than 2 years, the criteria for chronic depression. Recurrence is predicted by a number of factors including severity of depression, number of prior episodes, time since previous episode and absence of remission or presence of subsyndromal symptoms. The likelihood of recurrence increases with the number of previous episodes and the severity of the current episode: once a patient has suffered from three episodes of depression, he has more than 95% chance of having another. Although effective pharmacotherapeutic agents are available, depressed patients are often undertreated or treated for an inadequate period of time. Initial acute treatment of Major Depression results in a significant lessening of depressive symptoms (response) progressing to absence of depressive symptoms (remission) which means the return to the patient’s premorbid state. Stable remission for 46 months is thought of as a recovery. A worsening of symptoms or the return of a major depression is considered a relapse before recovery has been achieved and recurrence if it occurs later. The distinction between remission vs. recovery and relapse vs. recurrence is not possible. The three phases of treatment are: acute therapy; continuation therapy; maintenance therapy. The acute phase of therapy covers the time period from the beginning of treatment to remission, which is the primary therapeutic goal. The continuation phase follows the acute phase to preserve and stabilize the remission. It is the phase in which the treatment is extended for a period of time in order to prevent a return of depression. Long-term maintenance treatment is aimed at the prevention of a new episode of depression. Long-term tolerability is, therefore, important in facilitating adherence to treatment and thereby control over depressive symptoms. The new Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inihibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin Noradrenaline Reuptake Inihibitors (SNRIs) are generally better tolerated than older treatments, such as Tricyclic antidepressants and Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors. Venlafaxine XR, with its dual action of serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibition, has been shown to be superior in efficacy to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for severe Majors Depressive Disorder. Clinical studies suggests that it has a rapid onset of action, producing significant clinical improvement in the first or second week of treatment, and long-term efficacy and may have consistently superior remission rates compared with the SSRIs. Moreover Venlafaxine XR (extended release) was effective in 92% of depressed patients in preventing recurrence in the second year of maintenance therapy (Prevent Study).",

As defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition (DSM‐IV), depression is the persistent presence over a period of at least two weeks of at least five of nine of its cardinal symptoms: depressed mood and anhedonia (of which at least one must be present), clinically significant weight gain/loss or increase/decrease in appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or of excessive guilt, decrease in concentration, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Culture can influence numerous processes interfacing with this disorder, including symptom presentation, prevalence, utilization of services, and selection of and response to treatment.",

      "title": "The promise of social recovery therapy in non‐affective psychoses",
      "abstract": "Non-affective psychoses (schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorders) are the health conditions of working age adults most frequently associated with poor social outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies suggest that less than 50% of people with these conditions achieve social recovery, less than 15% achieve sustained recovery in both symptomatic and social domains, and only 10-20% of people return to competitive employment, despite the majority reporting that they wish to work1. Social recovery therapy (SRT) is a psychosocial treatment to promote social recovery in people with non-affective psychosis who are socially withdrawn, have complex and comorbid problems, and are unresponsive to existing interventions. It is based on a model in which social disability evolves as a result of lifestyle patterns of low activity, adopted to achieve behavioral avoidance, and maintained by lack of hope, agency and motivation. Social disability in psychosis typically occurs in the context of persistent positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, often accompanied by depression, anxiety and other psychopathological manifestations. Alongside such issues are complex social circumstances and systemic issues, including problematic family dynamics, victimization, social threat and social deprivation. In the face of such problems, individuals adopt lifestyle patterns of extreme social withdrawal, leaving work or education and losing contact with social networks. SRT is described in a manual2 and delivered individually across 9 months. Sessions take place in participants' homes and community locations. Interim telephone and email contact usually occurs. SRT delivery is structured in three stages. Stage 1 includes assessment and development of a shared social recovery formulation. Stage 2 involves identifying and working towards medium- to long-term goals guided by a systemic formulation of barriers to recovery, with a focus on promoting a sense of agency, hope and motivation, and encouraging activity while managing psychotic symptoms. Stage 3 involves the active promotion of structured activity linked to meaningful goals, while still managing symptoms. The focus of the intervention is on the individual's personal values and goals, identifying problems and barriers to these, then promoting hope for meaningful behavioral change and activity toward these goals. There is a strong emphasis on the use of behavioral strategies (including behavioral experiments, graded exposure and behavioral activation) to overcome avoidance and promote meaningful lifestyle change in vivo whilst managing symptoms as necessary to implement a concrete pathway to social recovery. Evidence and experiences from this behavioral work are used to further instill hope and promote positive beliefs about self as the individual works towards achieving meaningful change in his/her life. As SRT aims to engage people with psychosis into structured activity, it often includes supporting them to access employment, education, training, voluntary and/or leisure opportunities. Much of SRT takes place in community settings. It is often useful for the therapist to drive the client to new locations and settings or accompany him/her on public transport. To achieve gains in social recovery against a background of often years of withdrawal and social disadvantage means that therapists have to integrate techniques typically associated with assertive community treatment and supported employment. Working systemically with families and stakeholders surrounding the individual to promote opportunities in the social environment is also important. Behavioral activation and behavioral experiments are conducted in line with the client's identified goals and values and at a pace respecting the nature of the difficulties faced. The therapist works alongside the client to aid motivation and engagement in identified activities that can be incorporated into daily life, and work out collaborative strategies to manage ongoing symptoms in vivo. To date, we have conducted two assessor-blind randomized controlled trials of SRT in people with psychosis with severe social disability. In the Improving Social Recovery in Early Psychosis (ISREP) trial3, 77 participants with affective or non-affective psychosis presenting social withdrawal were randomized to receive either SRT plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone. TAU consisted of case management from a secondary mental health care team. In the non-affective psychosis group, SRT showed a significant and clinically beneficial effect on the primary outcome of weekly hours in structured activity, as well as on positive and negative symptoms. There was also an effect of SRT on hopelessness and positive beliefs about self, with improvements on these variables being a mediator of the change in structured activity. The intervention was also cost-effective4. SUPEREDEN35 was a larger (N=154) phase 2 trial aimed to enhance social recovery in patients who had not responded to early intervention service (EIS) treatment, by combining standard EIS provision with SRT. The primary analysis indicated that the SRT plus EIS was associated with an average increase in structured activity over 8 hours per week greater than EIS alone (95% CI: 2.5-13.6; p=0.005). The size of the effect represents an amount of activity equivalent to a full working day. There is evidence from both the above trials that the gain from SRT may be maintained 6 months beyond active treatment. In a further separate longer-term follow-up study on the ISREP group6, none of the 24 cases in the TAU group had engaged in paid employment in the year following the end of the intervention period, compared with 5 out of 20 (25%) cases in the SRT+TAU group. SRT offers most promise in promoting social recovery in complex cases of non-affective psychoses in which there is little evidence of response to other interventions. Although the results from the two available randomized controlled trials are positive, further large scale pragmatic studies are needed, possibly being expanded to more chronic cases. There may also be promise in combining SRT approaches with other psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive remediation therapy7. We designed SRT so that it can be delivered in task-sharing formats by a less costly and more widely available workforce than that involved in the above trials. We have now developed extensive training materials, including videos as well as adherence and supervision guidance, which we have collated on a website8. Through this and related work, we have found that it is possible to train \"non-expert therapists\" in key elements of the SRT approach, which can then be successfully implemented following the manual. What is needed in the future is to build on the promise of the existing trials of SRT toward further research and implementation involving non-expert therapists and extending into wider populations of people with non-affective psychosis in the community.",

      "abstract": "The biomechanical expert opinion on the injury mechanism is necessary in few cases only. However, the judgement of these cases is extremely compromised if mechanically wrong terms are introduced in the clinical report. Since the injury mechanism in the neck is very complex the clinical physician should concentrate on the clinical findings familiar to him; usually the clinician lacks technical case documentation and specific training in injury biomechanics. The relevant mechanisms of neck injuries are an indirect trauma induced by a) a head contact leading to compression, hyperflexion, hyperextension and/or hypertranslation and b) a non-head-contact mechanism (hyperflexion or hyperextension, hypertranslation, acceleration). A non-contact mechanism occurs e.g. during a rear end impact without head restraint (hyperextension) or a frontal collision of a belted occupant (hyperflexion) without head impact. The term \"whiplash\" is misleading and incorrect: It presumes a virtually non existing two phase movement back and forth (or vice versa) like during the development of the crack of the whip. Secondly, it mixes the physical criterion mechanism with the anatomical or morphological criterion injury e.g. distortion, sprain etc. A (head)-contact mechanism is due to a corresponding momentum exerted from the head on the neck. Again, the anatomical or morphological terms are equal, but the mechanism is different. During a contact mechanism as well as during a non-contact mechanism not only a hyperflexion or a hyperextension can occur; in the first phase of the impact also a shearing force between the upper vertebral bodies (CO-C2) may load the intervertebral structures by hypertranslation.",

Little is known about disorders “usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood and adolescence” (e.g., childhood-onset disorders) in “prodromal” teens at heightened clinical risk for psychotic disorder. Main Findings: Childhood-onset disorders were prevalent in putatively prodromal teens, including anxiety and disruptive disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and, surprisingly, elimination disorders. These may reflect developmental antecedents in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Key Data and Statistics: A case series of 9 teens (ages 13–17) identified as prodromal to psychosis were evaluated with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). Childhood-onset diagnoses commonly endorsed (threshold or subthreshold) included ADHD (5/9), oppositional defiant disorder (5/9), enuresis or encopresis (4/9), conduct disorder (2/9), separation anxiety (3/9), and transient tic disorder (2/9). Enuresis was identified in 3 of the 4 older teens (ages 15–17). Major Conclusions: An understanding of the childhood-onset disorders that occur in teens at risk for psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, can shed light on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and potentially inform early identification and intervention.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of growth and pubertal development in the teenage years present as a spectrum of abnormalities embracing common normal variants, less common disease states, and rare disorders increasingly recognised and understood as genetic in origin. This brief review is intended to provide a guide to the diagnosis of problems presenting most commonly in adolescent/teenage children, to help with initial assessment and management and to stress the need for referral to appropriate endocrine or other specialist services. Long-term management of individual diagnoses is beyond the scope of this article (references are provided for further reading). In order to focus on the teenage child, precocious puberty (by definition, before the age of 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys) is not discussed, but readers can seek guidance from a recent review 1. Delayed grow th and puberty Pubertal delay is the commonest problem seen. It is usually associated with apparent poor growth ‐ but not necessarily with short stature, as growth rate is intimately related to pubertal development. What may seem to be growth failure is an inevitable consequence if a child is later than average with timing of onset of puberty (as are 50% of children!). The clinical problem is to decide whether development is abnormal, in terms of being late with the onset of puberty or of failing to progress to completion of puberty at a normal rate (arrested puberty). Growth delay is common and usually there is no underlying pathology (boys in particular may none the less benefit from treatment), whereas arrested pubertal development is a major cause for concern. By convention, delayed puberty is defined as lack of puberty at an age +2 standard deviations (SD) above the population mean (boys: 14 years; girls: 13 years) 2 . The mean time to progress from puberty onset in boys to adult testicular volume is 3.2± 1.8 years (mean ± SD), and in girls from onset of breast development to menarche is 2.41.1 (mean ± SD) years. Thus, if 4‐ 5 years have elapsed from puberty onset without completion, investigations should be made. Delayed puberty may be classified as primary delay (constitutional) or secondary delay (underlying chronic illness). Children with failure to enter puberty because of a disorder of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis may also be divided into two groups, having either hypogonadotrophic or hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism",

      "abstract": "Low back pain is one of the most common musculoske-letal complaints and, from a public health perspective, is themost costly (1,2). In most cases, it is benign and disappearswithin six weeks, but approximately 20% of individualswith lumbar pain do not show any improvement in theircondition, which may progress to chronic low back pain.This chronic condition is difficult to manage and iscorrelated with many mechanical alterations (3).Maintenance of postural balance under static or dynamicconditions is essential for any functional activity (4). Inindividuals with chronic low back pain, the degree of controlmay change such that performing daily tasks becomescompromised and the chronic nature of the disease issustained (4-7). The mechanisms that lead to such abnorm-alities of postural control remain unclear. Pain is animportant factor in mechanical and neural alterations, butthe extent to which it influences postural balance still cannotbe determined. One of the hypotheses of this study is that thegreater the lumbar pain and physical disability, the worse thepatient’s maintenance of both static and dynamic posture.Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate thecorrelations between lumbar pain and the degree of disabilityand postural balance among women with chronic low backpain.",

Women complain of unbidden feelings of genital arousal that are qualitatively different from sexual arousal that is preceded by sexual desire/and or subjective arousal. The majority of women find PGAD distressing and report only brief relief with orgasm. In this article, we describe five women who believe they developed PGAD either after withdrawing from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressants or while using them. We discuss these sexual symptoms in relation to what is already known about prolonged SSRI withdrawal syndromes and the possible etiologies of these conditions. While not a common cause of PGAD, it is possible that use of, and withdrawal from, pharmacological agents contributes to the development of PGAD.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunctions related to psychotropic drugs are among the most distressing adverse effects and can lead to non-adherence to treatment. Objectives To elucidate the mechanisms of psychotropic-induced sexual dysfunctions and to suggest strategies for their management. Methods Literature review based on the keywords “psychotropics,” “sexuality,” and “sexual dysfunction”. Results Psychotropic medications can impact sexuality either directly or indirectly. The direct effect is primarily due to a decrease in the mesocortical dopaminergic atmosphere, either by blocking D2 receptors or by stimulating 5HT2A receptors. D2 receptor blockade in the tubero-infundibular pathway triggers an increase in prolactin secretion, which can subsequently lead to erection problems, decreased libido, and difficulties achieving orgasm. Action in the nigrostriatal pathway may result in an extrapyramidal syndrome, which can, in turn, hinder intimate physical relations. The indirect effect can also be caused by metabolic complications, which are significant risk factors for sexual dysfunction, as they can lead to male hypogonadism and a negative self-image. Therapeutic strategies suggest either reducing doses (if the patient’s condition allows), changing the drug, or adding an adjunctive medication. Aripiprazole, being a partial agonist of D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist of D3 and 5-HT2A receptors, appears to cause fewer sexual dysfunctions and can reduce hyperprolactinemia when added to other antipsychotics. Conclusions Healthcare professionals must proactively gather information on sexuality given its impact on quality of life and treatment adherence. Prioritizing this dimension of well-being demonstrates a respectful approach toward the patient and establishes the foundation for a strong therapeutic alliance.

      "abstract": "It has been a clinical case of a polimorphic psychotic disorder in a male of 26-year-old, affected by brain palsy, previously with adequate cognitive function, undergoing remarkable confusional fluctuations and a waking state apparently well-preserved. As possible comorbidities or triggers we could count on a tonsillitis and/or a depressive reaction a few days before. Serious consideration must be given to a differential diagnosis with an encephalitis but, despite the presence of an intermittent febricula, it was rejected by both units: internal medicine and neurology, after performing some complementary tests, albeit some more specific tests are still pending. His psychiatric background was also checked, which initially was orientated as a questionable bipolar disorder. At all events, symptoms stopped progressively until, almost complete remittance in the moment he was discharged from the hospital. He recovered his normal functionality. The treatment given was risperidon 2 mL/day, quetiapin 50 mg/8 h and baclofen 10 mg/12 h. This can be used as an example of how many difficulties we usually found to catalogue an acute disorder in first phases, even to encompass the clinical profile within the limits of psychiatry or neurology.

A apresentação deste caso clínico justifica-se pela incidência crescente deste diagnóstico e pela importância do reconhecimento atempado de fatores causais reversíveis para o mesmo, que permita a realização de tratamento dirigido e a minimização de complicações. Descrição do Caso: Homem de 70 anos, solteiro, ex-fumador, com antecedentes de alcoolismo e de comportamentos sexuais de risco. É trazido pela filha à consulta por um quadro com quatro anos de evolução de alteração comportamental, com episódios de heteroagressividade, discurso incoerente, perda progressiva de autonomia e autonegligência e descoordenação motora associada a alterações da marcha com quedas frequentes. Destaca-se a deteção, duas semanas antes da data da consulta, de lesão cutânea escrotal com 4x2cm de diâmetro e 2cm de espessura, de consistência elástica, indolor, ulcerada, compatível com goma sifilítica. Por suspeita de sífilis terciária é encaminhado para o serviço de urgência (SU), com posterior internamento e confirmação de neurossífilis, tendo cumprido terapêutica prolongada com penicilina endovenosa (EV), com melhoria do quadro neurológico. Três meses depois é reinternado por reativação de neurossífilis e medicado com penicilina, seguindo-se, após alta, um agravamento do seu estado clínico, com caquexia, diminuição global da força muscular mais evidente ao nível dos membros inferiores, disartria marcada e disfagia progressiva. Faleceu 11 meses depois, por pneumonia associada aos cuidados de saúde. Comentário: Neste caso clínico destaca-se a presença de uma causa potencialmente reversível de demência: neurossífilis. Após tratamento verificou-se uma melhoria parcial do quadro; contudo, sem completa recuperação e com posterior deterioração progressiva. Este aspeto justifica-se pelo diagnóstico tardio e pela presença concomitante de outros fatores etiológicos para a síndroma demencial. Pelo conhecimento dos antecedentes pessoais, do contexto sociofamiliar e do estado prévio do seu doente, o médico de família encontra-se numa posição privilegiada para o diagnóstico precoce e orientação destas situações.",

      "title": "Compulsive Masturbation Treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",
      "abstract": "Masturbation can be defined as a person's achieving sexual pleasure which usually results in orgasm by himself or herself (autoeroticism). Masturbation is a normal activity that is common in all stages of life from infancy to old age, but this viewpoint was not always accepted. Freud believed that neurasthenia was caused by excessive masturbation. In the early 1900s, masturbatory insanity was a common diagnosis in hospitals for the criminally insane in the United States. Masturbation is abnormal when it is the only type of sexual activity performed in adulthood, when its frequency indicates a compulsion or sexual dysfunction, or when it is consistently preferred to sex with a partner [1]. Compulsive masturbation does not have a distinct code in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition D.S.M.-V (2013) but can be classified as other specified sexual dysfunction [2]. The I.C.D.–10 classifications (W.H.O., 1992) ha ve a diagnostic category termed “excessive sexual desire” and compulsive masturbation may fall into this category [3]. Compulsive sexual behavior has been characterized as a behavioral addiction and an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder. It has been quantified using the statistic of total sexual outlet (number of orgasms/week). People with compulsive sexual behavior referred for treatment generally show a total sexual outlet of >7 [4]. Early psychological injury, from sexual abuse, physical abuse, exposure to violence, attachment trauma, or early sexualization, is at the root of sexually compulsive behavior [4,5]. Compulsive sexual behavior frequently has associated comorbidities of current mood disorders 33%, anxiety disorders 42% , substance disorders 29% and Personality disorders 46% [6,7]. Physical injury in compulsive masturbation is common. Patients with this disorder may masturbate 5-15 times a day and loneliness is felt keenly after an orgasm. This disorder can interfere in occupational, social, interpersonal, and intimacy functioning. Many different agents have been cited in case reports as helpful in treating compulsive sexual behavior: lithium, buspirone, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics, naltrexone, and topiramate have all been reported to be helpful in treatment of sexual compulsivity [4].",

Withdrawal from sexual intimacy because of fear of failure can damage relationships and have a profound effect on overall wellbeing for the couple.2 Since erectile dysfunction often accompanies chronic illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, and a variety of neurological diseases, physicians from many medical disciplines will see patients with this disorder.3\n\n#### Summary points\n\nAlthough around 10% of men aged 40 to 70 years have complete erectile dysfunction, only a few seek medical help\n\nAs erectile dysfunction is frequently associated with a number of systemic illnesses and surgical treatments, a wide range of doctors must be aware of the condition in their patients\n\nCurrent effective treatments include psychosexual counselling, vacuum erection devices, intracavernosal and transurethral drug delivery, and penile prostheses\n\nPromising oral treatments are currently being investigated\n\nBoth doctors and the public need to be better informed about erectile dysfunction and its treatment\n\nThe publications comprising this review were selected from a formal search of the full Medline database (using the terms erectile dysfunction, impotence, and penile erection).

The prevalence of bipolar disorder I during a lifetime is about 1%, but, in general, the prevalence of bipolar spectrum disorders is significantly more (Hirschfeld, 2001). The prevalence of these disorders is 1-1.6% in the United States, and 1.5-3% around the world (Aghili, 2004). Most patients with bipolar spectrum disorders refer for treatment in a depressive episode and this reason proper diagnosis of the disease is often delayed for about ten years as it was found that given the type of disorder the average time for the treatment is about ten years (Hirschfeld, 2001). Such delays are often associated with undesirable results; patients do not receive appropriate treatment to relieve symptoms and may even receive treatments that exacerbate their symptoms so that they continue inappropriate behaviors which are destructive to themselves and their relatives (Hirschfeld, 2001).",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenic psychosis is rare in patients below 15 years of age. Early diagnosis is crucial as the illness is likely to have a poor outcome: indeed, duration of untreated psychosis may exert a negative influence on the prognosis. Thus, it may be highly relevant to recognise premorbid changes of character traits, behaviour and cognitive problems which are reflected in worsening school performance. For example, some 40 to 50% of the children who later develop a psychosis will show social withdrawal, loss of interest in age-appropriate activities, peculiar or immature responsiveness, increasingly suspicious, fearful or depressive states, baseless despair, unusual somatic complaints, concentration problems, cognitive and linguistic disabilities, and peculiar motor movement disorders such as bizarre, ritualistic behaviour, mannerisms, stereotypies, echopraxia. These features are non-specific: they can but need not represent the early signs indicating later development of schizophrenia. They should be evaluated in terms of potential psychosocial, genetic and somatic pre-, peri- and postnatal risk categories. During the child's development these features may build up to constitute vulnerability and stress factors that may lead to psychotic breakdown. Early age of onset correlates with high social disability scores. Complete remission is an extremely rare event in patients with gradual-insidious onset of psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Findings and recommendations on the assessment and treatment of adults with acute low back problems — activity limitations due to symptoms in the low back and/ or back-related leg symptoms of less than 3 months’ duration — are presented in this clinical practice guideline. The following are the principal conclusions of this guideline: • The initial assessment of patients with acute low back problems focuses on the detection of “red flags” (indicators of potentially serious spinal pathology or other nonspinal pathology). • In the absence of red flags, imaging studies and further testing of patients are not usually helpful during the first 4 weeks of low back symptoms. • Relief of discomfort can be accomplished most safely with nonprescription medication and/or spinal manipulation. • While some activity modification may be necessary during the acute phase, bed rest &gt;4 days is not helpful and may further debilitate the patient. • Low-stress aerobic activities can be safely started in the first 2 weeks of symptoms to help avoid debilitation: exercises to condition trunk muscles are commonly delayed at least 2 weeks. • Patients recovering from acute low back problems are encouraged to return to work or their normal daily activities as soon as possible. • If low back symptoms persist, further evaluation may be indicated. • Patients with sciatica may recover more slowly, but further evaluation can also be safely delayed. • Within the first 3 months of low back symptoms, only patients with evidence of serious spinal pathology or severe, debilitating symptoms of sciatica, and physiologic evidence of specific nerve root compromise corroborated on imaging studies can be expected to benefit from surgery. • With or without surgery, 80 percent of patients with sciatica recover eventually. • Nonphysical factors (such as psychological or socio-economic problems) may be addressed in the context of discussing reasonable expectations for recovery.",

      "abstract": "About 10 percent of all patients in general practice suffer from a depression. In about one half of these cases depressive syndromes remain undetected by the physician. Common leading symptoms in these undiagnosed patients are: pain, rapid exhaustion, irritability and sexual problems. Depressive episodes in women are twice as frequent as in men. Furthermore, chronic diseases, chronic pain symptoms, addiction problems as well as recent, psychologically burdening events increase the risk for a depression. If anamnesis or clinical investigation are suggestive for a depression, the patient should be explored systematically with respect to his symptoms. Main symptoms of a depression are depressed mood, loss of enthusiasm and joyfulness as well as depressed motivation and increased fatigability. Further common symptoms are reduced self-confidence, unfounded self-accusations, suicidal thoughts, reduced ability to concentrate, hyperagitation or psychomotor restriction, sleeping disorders as well as loss of appetite. Since depression can be positively influenced by antidepressive drugs or suitable psychotherapeutic methods, early diagnosis by the physician is of decisive importance.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), historically referred to as pseudoseizures or hysterical seizures, are sudden disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

      "title": "Unexpected emergence from the vegetative state: delayed discovery rather than late recovery of consciousness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background The vegetative state, also known as the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, is one of the worst possible outcomes of acquired brain injury and confronts rehabilitation specialists with various challenges. Emergence to (minimal) consciousness is classically considered unlikely beyond 3–6 months after non-traumatic or 12 months after traumatic etiologies. A growing body of evidence suggests that these timeframes are too narrow, but evidence regarding chances of recovery is still limited. Objective To identify the moment of recovery of consciousness in documented cases of late emergence from a vegetative state. Methods Four cases of apparent late recovery of consciousness, identified within a prospective cohort study, were studied in-depth by analyzing medical, paramedical and nursing files and interviewing the patients’ families about their account of the process of recovery. Results All patients were found to have shown signs of consciousness well within the expected time frame (5 weeks–2 months post-ictus). These behaviors, however, went unnoticed or were misinterpreted, leading to a diagnostic delay of several months to over 5 years. Absence of appropriate diagnostics, the use of erroneous terminology, sedative medication but also patient-related factors such as hydrocephalus, language barriers and performance fluctuations are hypothesized to have contributed to the delay. Conclusions Delayed recognition of signs of consciousness in patients in a vegetative state may not only lead to suboptimal clinical care, but also to distorted prognostic figures. Discriminating late recovery from the delayed discovery of consciousness, therefore, is vital to both clinical practice and science.",

      "title": "Sexual dysfunction, depression, and the impact of antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants and can have significant impact on the person’s quality of life, relationships, mental health, and recovery. The reported incidence of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant medication varies considerably between studies, making it difficult to estimate the exact incidence or prevalence. Objectives The focus of this e-poster is to explore the incidence, pathophysiology, and treatment of depression disorder and antidepressant iatrogenic sexual dysfunction. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: depression, sexual disfunction, antidepressant. Results Sexual dysfunction is a common symptom of depression. Although decreased libido is most often reported, difficulties with arousal, resulting in vaginal dryness in women and erectile dysfunction in men, and absent or delayed orgasm are also prevalent. Sexual dysfunction is also a frequent adverse effect of treatment with most antidepressants and is one of the predominant reasons for premature drug discontinuation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most widely prescribed antidepressants and have significant effects on arousal and orgasm compared with antidepressants that target norepinephrine, dopamine, and melatonin systems. The availability of an antidepressant that does not cause or exacerbate sexual dysfunction represents an advance in pharmacotherapy for mood disorders and should reduce treatment noncompliance and decrease the need for switching antidepressants. Conclusions The sexual problems reported range from decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, to erection or delayed ejaculation problems. There are a number of case reports of sexual side effects, such as priapism, painful ejaculation, penile anesthesia, loss of sensation in the vagina and nipples, persistent genital arousal and nonpuerperal lactation in women.

      "abstract": "• A modified dexamethasone suppression test (DST) has had unprecedented evaluation among biologic tests proposed for clinical use in psychiatry. It has not proved to reflect pathophysiologic changes at the level of the central nervous system or pituitary, and tissue availability of dexamethasone itself may contribute to test outcome. The sensitivity of the DST in major depression is limited (about 44% in over 5,000 cases) but is higher in psychotic affective disorders and mixed manic-depressive states (67% to 78%). The high specificity of the DST vs control subjects (over 90%) is not maintained vs other psychiatric disorders (77% specificity overall), and acute \"distress\" may contribute to nonsuppression of cortisol. The test may have power in differentiating severe melancholic depression, mania, or acute psychosis from chronic psychosis (87% specificity) or dysthymia (77% specificity). The DST status adds about 11% to the prediction of short-term antidepressant response. Suggestions that failure to maintain normal suppression of cortisol predicts poor outcome are not secure. Uncritical enthusiasm or excessive skepticism regarding the DST are unwarranted.",

      "title": "Adrenal insufficiency following traumatic brain injury in adults",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review Hypoadrenalism occurs in approximately 25% of patients soon after traumatic brain injury. Neurosurgeons or critical care physicians should be prepared to diagnose and treat this and other related hormonal deficiencies. Recent findings The severity of traumatic brain injury, location of basilar skull fractures and edema or hemorrhage within the hypothalamic–pituitary axis appear correlated with secondary adrenal failure. Primary hypoadrenalism also may occur due to injury-related systemic inflammation. Hypotension requiring vasoactive drug support, hyponatremia and hypoglycemia may be corresponding clinical signs. Evaluation of either primary or secondary hypoadrenalism should include measurement of basal and post-adrenocorticotropin stimulation cortisol blood concentrations. If the basal cortisol is under 15 μg/dl or increases by over 9 μg/dl after stimulation treatment should be considered. Intravenous hydrocortisone at 50–100 mg every 8 h or by continuous infusion is usually sufficient but may be supplemented with a mineralocorticoid if hyponatremia persists. All patients sustaining severe traumatic brain injury should be tested for endocrine failure (adrenal, thyroid and growth hormone) 3 months after injury. Summary Adrenal gland failure or the inability to produce adrenocorticotropin and other pituitary hormones may occur early after traumatic brain injury. Acute treatment of either cause of hypoadrenalism may correct associated hypotension, hypoglycemia, or hyponatremia.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is the ultimate union of mind and body; sexual functioning or dysfunction depends on complex bio-psycho-social conditions. Sexual dysfunction (SD) may be primarily due to physical disorders, including endocrinologic (diabetes, androgen deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), cardiovascular and pelvic illnesses. SD can be secondary or indirectly related to impairments of the physical disorder such as fatigue, weakness and bladder incontinence, or to the psychosocial stress of the illness. Not only the disease itself, but the treatment prescribed, may also cause sexual impairment. SD is prevalent among psychiatric patients and maybe related to both the psychopathology and the psychopharmacology. SD has been reported in as many as 30%-60% of patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotic medication, up to 78% of individuals with depression treated with antidepressants and up to 80% in patients suffering from anxiety disorder. Eating disorders and personality disorders, mainly borderline personality disorder, are also associated with SD. Psychosocial factors, like interpersonal relationships, length of relationship, lifestyle, socioeconomic class and cultural background have been shown to correlate with SD, especially in hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women. An evaluation of SD should take into consideration the primary sexual functioning, the physical and mental disorders, the various medications and the psychosocial factors. It is recommended to identify the specific cause of the SD and to treat the patient according to the individual's mental disorder, physical disorder and interpersonal relationship.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction occurs in men and women and the prevalence increases with age. Dysfunction can occur in one or more areas of the normal sexual response cycle: desire, arousal, or orgasm. It can also be due to pain. Family physicians should routinely screen all men and women for sexual dysfunction, given its high prevalence and high correlation with other conditions. Risk factors include use of prescription drugs (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, diuretics, antihormonals), recreational drugs, alcohol, and/or nicotine; certain health and lifestyle issues; and many chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes. Diagnosis is based on clinical features; therefore, a detailed sexual history and focused physical examination are critical. Laboratory testing, imaging, and management are tailored to the suspected condition. Although some therapies require referral, education of patients about the normal sexual response cycle, discontinuation or changing of drugs, screening for and management of comorbid conditions, and counseling and guidance about lifestyle changes or use of devices all can be addressed in the family medicine setting.",

      "abstract": "Hearing voices (i.e. auditory verbal hallucinations) is mainly known as part of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. However, hearing voices is a symptom that can occur in many psychiatric, neurological and general medical conditions. We present three cases of non-psychotic patients with auditory verbal hallucinations caused by different disorders. The first patient is a 74-year-old male with voices due to hearing loss, the second is a 20-year-old woman with voices due to traumatisation. The third patient is a 27-year-old woman with voices caused by temporal lobe epilepsy. Hearing voices is a phenomenon that occurs in a variety of disorders. Therefore, identification of the underlying disorder is essential to indicate treatment. Improvement of coping with the voices can reduce their impact on a patient. Antipsychotic drugs are especially effective when hearing voices is accompanied by delusions or disorganization. When this is not the case, the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs will probably not outweigh the side-effects.",

      "abstract": "The antipsychotic drugs can be of great benefit for the wide range of psychotic disorders, but all are associated with various adverse effects. Patients with psychotic disorder consider the sexual dysfunction to be among the most important side effects. Although, it is not uncommon for the patients with schizophrenia to report the sexual dysfunction, patients with untreated schizophrenia have fewer dysfunctions compared to those on antipsychotic medication. The decision whether the current treatment with a prolactin-increasing antipsychotic or sexual dysfunction inducing drug should be continued or switched to another antipsychotic drug, has to be made on the basis of the patient's risk-benefit estimation. It has to be kept on mind that adverse effects are usually dose dependent. In this case report, sertindole treated patient with chronic schizophrenia developed sexual side effect manifested as ejaculatory dysfunction that was significantly ameliorated by drug-dose reduction.",

      "title": "Effect of Marriage on Pre-existing Psychoses: A Convenient or Futile Solution for Severe Mental Disorders?",
      "abstract": "Marriage can be defined as the state of being united as spouses in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law. The general population generally believes marriage to be a solution to mental illnesses. It can be agreed that mental disorders and marital issues have some relation. Parents of patients with psychoses expect that marriage is the solution to the illness and often approach doctors and seek validation about the success of the marriage of their mentally ill child, which is a guarantee no doctor can give in even normal circumstances. Evidence on sexual functioning in patients of psychosis is limited and needs further understanding. Studies show about 60%–70% women of the schizophrenia spectrum and illness to experience sexual difficulties. Based on available information, sexual dysfunction in population with psychosis can be attributed to a variety of psychosocial factors, ranging from the psychotic symptoms in itself to social stigma and institutionalization and also due to the antipsychotic treatment. Despite the decline in sexual activity and quality of life in general, it is very rarely addressed by both the treating doctor and by the patient themselves hence creating a lacuna in the patient’s care and availability of information regarding the illness’ pathophysiology. Patients become noncompliant with medications due to this undesirable effect and hence it requires to be given more attention during treatment. It was also found that paranoid type of schizophrenia patient had lower chances of separation than patients with other types of schizophrenia. The risk of relapse in cases with later age of onset of the disease, lower education, a positive family history of psychosis or a lower income increased more than other populations.",

      "abstract": "### Treatment of tobacco addiction\n\nMost smokers show symptoms of addiction to nicotine.1 The symptoms and signs of addiction are described by diagnostic classification systems, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . However, perhaps the most important symptom in this context is the failure of attempts to stop smoking when a person tries to accomplish this. Frequent smoking is thought to set up a subconscious learning process linked to the release of nicotine from cigarettes.2 When a person decides to stop smoking, s/he is afflicted by urges to smoke, often in places where smoking has previously taken place.3 Furthermore, such a person usually experiences withdrawal symptoms.4 These are mostly adverse moods, but with some physical symptoms as well. It is thought that these urges to smoke are primarily responsible for the failure of most attempts to stop smoking. Without support around half of all attempts to stop fail within the first week of attempted abstinence.5 The typical smoker who seeks treatment for cessation has never managed more than a few weeks without smoking.6 The period of withdrawal varies by symptom, but typically lasts a few weeks.4 Therefore most smokers' experience of not smoking is state of withdrawal and perhaps beliefs that smoking is a stress reliever, for example, stem from experiencing withdrawal during abstinence.\n\nThe two main approaches to assist cessation are pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation aims primarily to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or ameliorate the aversive symptoms. Behavioural support aims to boost or support motivation to resist the urge to smoke and develop people's capacity to implement their plans to avoid smoking. These interventions last typically only a few months. It is thought that during these months, the strength of the associative learning between smoking and …",

      "abstract": "The Case of Mr A Mr A is a 73-year-old man whose wife of 50 years died 5 weeks previously. He has no appetite, has lost 8 lb in the past month, consistently awakens at 4 am, “can’t think straight,” and no longer takes any pleasure in customary activities. He denies feelings of guilt or worthlessness. Although he denies suicidal intent, he confides that he wishes to join his dearly departed wife. When discussing his wife, he shows moderate psychomotor agitation and spends most days mindlessly sitting in front of his television. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR),1 Mr A does not have a psychiatric condition; consequently, treatment with antidepressants or formal psychotherapy is not indicated. Mr A would be assigned the V-code, bereavement, and reassured that nothing is wrong. However, according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10),2 Mr A has major depressive disorder (MDD). Ostensibly, decisions about treatment would be made just as they would after any other, non–bereavement-related, episode of MDD. The question to be addressed in the following discussion is whether the best available evidence more strongly supports the DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10.",

Many clinicians question the advisability of treating a persistent primary amenorrhea since the establishment of autonomous function cannot readily be expected with the available means of therapy (1–4). It is noteworthy that cases of this type are seriously handicapped both psychologically and sociologically. There is a persistent request and need for any treatment, regardless of its limitations, which might enable these patients to cope with their handicaps. Cyclical uterine bleeding or menstruation can be induced in any type of functional amenorrhea with adequate dosage of estrogens and progestogens (5–9).

Variability exists in the level of symptom burden in that some women experience mild symptoms, whereas a small minority experience severe and debilitating symptoms. For an estimated 5%–8% of premenopausal women, work or social functioning are affected by severe premenstrual syndrome. Many women in this group meet diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Among women who suffer from PMDD, mood and behavioral symptoms such as irritability, depressed mood, tension, and labile mood dominate. Somatic complaints, including breast tenderness and bloating, also can prove disruptive to women's overall functioning and quality of life. Recent evidence suggests that individual sensitivity to cyclical variations in levels of gonadal hormones may predispose certain women to experience these mood, behavioral, and somatic symptoms. Treatments include: antidepressants of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor class, taken intermittently or throughout the menstrual cycle; medications that suppress ovarian cyclicity; and newer oral contraceptives with novel progestins.",

      "title": "Management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The role of mood stabilizers",
      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with symptoms that extend far beyond cognitive deficits. The most distressing of these symptoms are known as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and include delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggression, misidentification, and sexually inappropriate behaviors. As a result of BPSD, AD patients suffer a poorer quality of life, as do their caregivers.1 Behavioral and psychological symptoms can be so distressing to the caregiver that they are a common reason for families placing their loved ones in long-term care. Approximately 60% and 80% of dementia patients living in the community and in long-term care settings develop BPSD, respectively.1Aggression and agitation are characterized by increased or disruptive psychomotor activity, inappropriate verbal activity, or disorganized motor activity that is not explained by the patient's needs. Often times, dementia patients present with aggression and agitation as well as psychotic symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics have been the most widely studied agents for the management of psychotic symptoms as well as aggression and agitation.1 Despite their noted efficacy for BPSD, their use has been curtailed over recent years due to concerns about an increase in cerebrovascular events and increased mortality with their use. This has led to an ongoing search for other effective pharmacologic treatments for BPSD. Several mood stabilizers including valproic acid, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate have been studied in dementia patients. This paper aims to present the data on the efficacy of mood stabilizing drugs for the management of BPSD.In 2007, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) developed a white paper on the use of antipsychotics in elderly people with dementia for the purpose of treating psychosis and agitation.1 This paper also reviewed the use of numerous other psychotropic drugs in this population. Evidence for atypical antipsychotic efficacy in psychosis of dementia indicated that these agents have modest efficacy. The data are difficult to interpret because these studies often included patients with psychosis and agitation. To further complicate the studies, the primary outcome was often a measure of global psychiatric symptoms, not a rating scale to assess psychosis or agitation only. There have been very few studies evaluating the use of atypical antipsychotics for agitation only. This is partly due to the fact it is difficult to recruit dementia patients with agitation only since it frequently overlaps with psychosis. Agents such as risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole have reportedly shown some benefit for agitation in dementia patients.Nearly 10 years ago, the FDA issued a warning regarding cerebrovascular events (CVEs) such as strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) associated with the use of risperidone. Soon after, the FDA evaluated CVE's with other atypical antipsychotics and the warning was added to olanzapine and aripiprazole. Furthermore, an analysis of pooled data indicated that the rates of CVEs were 1.9% for patients receiving atypical antipsychotics and 0.9% for placebo-treated patients (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2–2.8). Of course there are limitations to these data, most notably of which is that these studies were not powered to evaluate the relationship between drug and adverse events; they were powered to evaluate efficacy. In addition, the definition of CVE is not defined in the studies, nor were these events validated. Lastly, there is likely no difference in the rates of CVEs between typical and atypical agents.In addition to the risk of CVEs, increased mortality rates in the elderly have been reported with atypical antipsychotics. These data led the FDA to issue a black box warning for antipsychotics in the elderly regarding the higher mortality rates, which were mostly due to cardiac or infectious disease. A meta-analysis reported that the elderly mortality rate was 3.5% with atypical agents compared to 2.3% with placebo. Again, there were numerous limitations cited including limited data regarding the circumstances around the deaths as well as controversy surrounding the mortality risk in patients receiving typical antipsychotics.The study known as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness for Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) evaluated the use of antipsychotics in elderly dementia patients under naturalistic conditions.2 Patients were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of treatment for any reason as well as minimal improvement as noted on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks. Patients reportedly discontinued quetiapine due to lack of efficacy after a mean of only 9.1 weeks compared to olanzapine and risperidone where patients continued treatment for a mean of 22.1 and 26.7 weeks, respectively. Patients discontinued all treatments earlier than placebo due to adverse events.In addition to reporting the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia patients with psychosis and agitation, the ACNP white paper also reported on the use of other psychotropic drugs for these symptoms.1 There were three trials that evaluated the efficacy of VPA for agitation or aggression in dementia patients.3–5 Two of the studies were completed in patients with agitation and one with patients with aggression. All three studies failed to show any benefit of VPA over placebo for management of aggression or agitation. Additionally, two trials evaluated the short-term (6 week) use of carbamazepine (CBZ) for agitation. Both CBZ trials were small (n of 51 and 21), and reported mixed results. Total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores indicated that CBZ was more effective than placebo in one study7 but no difference was found in the other.6 Olin and colleagues actually reported that there was a significant improvement on the hostility item of the BPRS but a worsening of the hallucination item in CBZ-treated patients.6 The authors also reported that their study lacked statistical power and that they would have needed 69 patients in order to confirm the findings regarding the total BPRS scores.6Unfortunately, the long-term use of CBZ is limited by its poor tolerability, including ataxia and disorientation, and the risk of significant drug-drug interactions.Since the publication of the ACNP white paper, there has been one further study that evaluated the efficacy of VPA in agitation and aggression.8 This study included patients with moderate to severe AD and were experiencing agitation or aggression based on Neuropsychiatric Inventory Scores (NPI). Patients had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV)9 criteria for AD, have a mini-mental status exam (MMSE) score of < 15, and an NPI > 8. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 2 week wash-out period. Forty patients were referred, but consent was obtained from only 16. Two patients dropped out prior to enrollment, leaving 14 in the study (8M, 6F). Prior to starting the study, patients underwent a wash-out of current psychotropic medications for a period equal to 5 half-lives of the drugs. Treatment was initiated with VPA 125 mg twice per day for one week and increased to 500 mg twice per day during week two. The dose was increased according to symptom response and patient tolerability to a maximum of 1,500 mg per day. The dose could be decreased, as needed. Loxapine 2.5 mg up to 4 doses per week was permitted as a rescue medication. The primary outcome was the NPI agitation score. Secondary measures were the NPI total score and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Wilcoxon signed ranks tests comparing the change in scores for VPA vs. placebo.The results indicated that the NPI agitation scores decreased for VPA-treated patients and increased for placebo-treated patients (1.43+/−3.87 vs-2.08 +/−4.05, p=0.043). The change in scores for the VPA group represents a worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was also seen on the total NPI and CMAI scores, but was significant only for the CMAI (NPI p=0.075 and CMAI p=0.039). Twelve VPA patients had adverse effects such as falls (5), sedation (4), thrombocytopenia (2), and loose stools (2). The placebo group had 2 patients with sedation and 1 fall. The conclusion is that VPA was ineffective for agitation and aggression and was poorly tolerated in elderly AD patients.A second study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of VPA for preventing agitation and aggression in AD patients.10 Patients had to meet criteria for possible or probable AD by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke AND the Alzheimer's Diseaseand Related Disorders Association criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA), have a MMSE of 12–20, and be free from agitation or psychosis as defined by NPI < 1 on items assessing delusions, hallucinations, or agitation. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm flexible-dose study. Patients received VPA for two years in a double-blind fashion, and then had a two-month, single-blind placebo treatment period. The VPA target dose was 10–12 mg/kg and used identical appearing VPA and placebo tablets. The primary outcome was defined as the development of a score of at least 3 on one or more NPI items assessing delusions, hallucinations, and agitation for 2 weeks. Other scales used to assess secondary outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), CMAI, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study activities of daily living (ADCS-Activities of Daily Living), the Quality of Life-AD, and the ADCS Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The primary endpoint was evaluated using the cox proportional hazards model comparing time to end point in the drug and placebo groups and adjusted for variables such as age, sex, baseline MMSE, total NPI, total CMAI, and ADCS-Activities of Daily Living. All assessments were completed at baseline, and every three months until the 24th month, then at month 26. Five hundred thirteen patients were screened and 313 were randomized. At enrollment, the mean MMSE in both groups was 16.9 and the NPI subscales for agitation, delusions, and hallucinations were < 1.0. The mean modal dose of VPA was 250 mg/day and the mean VPA level at 12 months was 42.7 mcg/ml. Sixty-one percent of VPA and 62% of placebo patients discontinued treatment early. The time to the primary endpoint did not differ between the two groups (p=0.88). Twenty-nine placebo and 25 VPA patients reached the endpoint. The mean change in ADAS-cog scores indicated that there were some differences that favored placebo (VPA 9.4, PLC 6.8, p=0.01). The ADCS Activities of Daily Living scores at 18 months also favored placebo (VPA-19.3, PLC-14.4, p=0.02). More VPA than placebo-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (16% vs 7.5%). This study failed to show any benefit of VPA in preventing the development of agitation, delusions, or hallucinations.Due to the intolerability and drug interactions noted in carbamazepine trials as well as the lack of efficacy reported with VPA, other mood stabilizers have been evaluated for controlling BPSD. Topiramate (TOP) is a viable option secondary to its reported efficacy in controlling irritability and aggression in other psychiatric populations.11 However, there is concern with the use of TOP in the dementia population due to cognitive decline reported with its use.To date, there is only one published, prospective trial of TOP for aggression in dementia patients.12 This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, comparing topiramate to risperidone (RIS) that included 48 patients with mild to moderate severity of AD defined by an MMSE score of 10–26. Patients were included if they had a complaint of behavioral disturbances and had an NPI score of greater than 1 in sub-items relating to delusions; hallucinations; agitation and aggression; and irritability and lability. Topiramate was initiated at 25 mg/day and increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks. Risperidone was initiated at 0.25 mg/day with a doubling in dose every week until target dose of 2 mg/day was achieved. In both groups, the dose could be reduced if adverse events occurred. The mean daily dose of TOP was 44.0 mg and RIS was 1.9 mg. Any improvement on NPI parts 1 and 2 or the CMAI were considered the primary outcomes. Part 1 of the NPI assesses behavioral disturbances and affective and psychotic symptoms; part 2 assesses caregiver burden and distress. Cognitive function was assessed with the MMSE.Forty eight patients were enrolled, but 41 completed the trial. Seven patients dropped out due to adverse events; fatigue and loss of appetite were reported in the TOP group and GI disturbance and akathisia in the RIS group. Both groups showed improvements in the NPI parts 1 and 2 from baseline to week 8. However, no statistically significant differences were seen between groups (NPI part I: P<0.575, NPI part 2: P<0.456). Both groups also showed a decrease in agitation as assessed by CMAI scores but no statistically significant difference noted (P<0.927). Cognitive status on the MMSE was not found to change significantly in either group (P<0.479). In conclusion, the authors found that low dose TOP had comparable efficacy to RIS in treating behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer's dementia. However, nearly 15% failed to complete the study due to adverse events.Carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating BPSD, but carries a high risk for adverse events and drug-drug interactions.1 Oxcarbazepine(OXC) has been hypothesized to be efficacious as it has a similar structure to carbamazepine, but with better tolerability. There are case reports suggesting that oxcarbazepine may be beneficial in treating BPSD. To formally evaluate the efficacy of OXC for BPSD, an 8 week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with a diagnosis of AD, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia was conducted.13 This study included patients with moderate to severe dementia as defined by a MMSE of 0–20, a history of agitation or aggression for at least 1 week, a score of 6 or greater on Neurospychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) subscale for agitation and aggression, and were in a nursing home for at least 4 weeks. Patients who were receiving psychotropic medications prior to the study could not have dose changes within 2 weeks before and throughout the study. New psychotropic agents could not be initiated during the study except for haloperidol if needed as a rescue medication. Patients were randomly assigned to receive OXC 300–900 mg/day or placebo. Oxcarbazepine was initiated at 75 mg in the morning and 225 mg in the evening with dose increases up to a total of 900 mg/day after 3 weeks with the highest, well-tolerated dose maintained. The mean daily dose of OXC was 536.6 mg/day. The primary outcome was the change in the agitation and aggression subscore of NPI-NH. Secondary outcomes included change in agitation measured by the Brief Agitation Rating Scale (BARS) and change in burden of care measured by NPI-NH.A total of 103 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication with 83 patients completing the study. No significant difference was found between groups for any of the outcomes assessed regardless of whether the intention to treat or per protocol population analysis was used (NPI-NH agitation and aggression subscore P=0.70, BARS P=0.07, NPI-NH P=0.58). Interestingly, there was also no significant difference between groups in the use of haloperidol (P=0.26). The most common side effects occurring in the active treatment group included urinary tract infections, falls, a decrease in serum sodium, ataxia, fainting, and sedation. In conclusion, the study failed to show any benefit of OXC for the management of agitation or aggression in patients with moderate to severe dementia.There have been some smaller, open studies and case studies published on this topic involving other mood stabilizers not already mentioned in this review. A recent case series showed benefit with low dose gabapentin 200–600 mg/day in treating aggressive behavior in seven patients with the vascular or mixed dementia.14 Gabapentin was well tolerated and produced sustained results at follow up varying from 2–6 months.14Lamotrigine has shown to be effective and well-tolerated over six months in a case report of a patient diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia who was demonstrating verbal and physical aggression.15 Another case series of five patients with dementia, manic-like symptoms, and agitation treated with lamotrigine reported improvements on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) after five months of treatment.16 None of the patients had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events.Two small, open-label trials with less than 20 patients each reported the effectiveness of levetiracetam for the management of behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. Both trials found significant improvement from baseline in the NPI and YMRS.17,18 One report indicated that three patients required a dose reduction of levetiracetam as two patients experienced lethargy and one had an increase in agitation.17 The second study noted that no patient had to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, but did not mention if any dose reductions were required.18Since the publication of the ACNP White Paper in 2007, there have only been three randomized clinical trials studying mood stabilizers for treatment of BPSD. Low-dose TOP and RIS were reported to be equally effective for BPSD. Prospective, placebo-controlled trials of OXC and VPA failed to show any benefit in patients with BPSD. Open trials and case studies have shown some limited effectiveness for gabapentin, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam and require further evaluation in a controlled setting.Due to a paucity of data indicating efficacy and safety, no mood stabilizer is currently FDA approved for the management of BPSD. If a mood stabilizer is indicated for patients with dementia showing aggressive or agitated behavior, their use should only be considered in cases where the symptoms pose serious risk to the patient or their caregivers. Antipsychotics have the most data indicating some moderate efficacy for BPSD, but their use is associated with serious adverse events, like CVEs, and an increased mortality in the elderly. Carbamazepine also has reported mixed efficacy but is associated with poor tolerability and a risk of drug-drug interactions. Gabapentin, lamotrigine and levetiracetam may hold promise, but further research using placebo controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made with these agents. Overall, no single pharmacologic agent has shown efficacy and tolerability in the elderly patient with BPSD. Their use should be carefully considered on an individual basis in patients with clearly identified target symptoms followed by close monitoring for improvement.",

      "abstract": "Dissociative disorders are heterogeneous group of mental disorders with dissociation as dominant symptoms. Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is the term used to describe an abnormally prolonged state of self-perpetuating and evolving seizure activity, specifically defined by time, as a 5 minute seizure or an episode of briefer seizures with reduced recovery of awareness in between seizures1.\r\n\r\nSE can be convulsive or non-convulsive in type. Non-convulsive seizures represent states of various levels of altered awareness, associated with electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure activity, but without outwardly observable convulsive activity2. An important feature of convulsive seizures is their potential for evolution into non-convulsive seizures, where the patient can appear “post ictal” but is having electrical seizures, without obvious convulsive activity3. Other types of status epilepticus include simple partial status (with preserved awareness), complex partial status (with impaired consciousness) and myoclonic status (often associated with coma)4.\r\n\r\nRecords from antiquity describe SE, but it has only been in the last century that there have been major advances in its understanding and treatment5. Many significant questions remain about the pathophysiology and management of this medical emergency which carries a substantial morbidity and mortality. This paper will present the current understanding of SE, identifying gaps in our knowledge. The evidence base for the pharmacological management of SE will be reviewed.",

Chronic pelvic pain can be visceral, somatic, neuropathic, or a combination. Patients with CPP often suffer from concurrent bowel or bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, depression, and anxiety. The complexity of chronic pelvic pain can be challenging to treat, which can lead to frustration for both patients and their physicians. Treatment should involve a comprehensive and multi-modal approach involving psychosocial support, counseling, physical therapy, medication management, and interventional procedures. This manuscript will focus both on the etiologies and the interventional treatment options for chronic pelvic pain.",

This disorder is diagnosed when two of the following features occur: unilateral headache, throbbing pain, the pain worsening with activity, moderate or severe pain intensity, and at least one of the following: nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. Cluster headaches are one of a group of rare disorders known as trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of recurring headache. It's not a vascular headache or a migraine. The mean age of onset is during the second decade of life. Usually mild to moderate bilateral headaches with a feeling of tight bands or pressure around the head.",

      "abstract": "Rapid hormonal changes during pregnancy as well as psycho-social stressors accompanying parenthood have often been associated with peripartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder or with not yet clinically expressed bipolar diathesis. Yet, little is known about the correlation of peripartum onset of bipolar disorder in men. We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder with peripartum onset and subsequent episodes following the peripartum initiation of the disease, as well as the association of the couvade syndrome, as a pathological response to a man due to hormonal shifts observed in males cohabiting with a pregnant female. The patient had his first depressive episode during the peripartum period of his spouse, followed by two mixed episodes with psychotic features that leaded to his compulsory psychiatric evaluation and subsequent hospitalization and the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder I. There is a well-known correlation between the peripartum period and mood disturbances to the point of inducing full blown episodes, suggesting of a bipolar disorder initiation or mood episodes relapsing in female patients already diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Due to the patient's psychological disturbances and the phenomenology of his symptoms, mainly concerning the psychotic features accompanying his episodes, we discuss the possible underlying biological correlates as a triggering mechanism, that might overlap the manifestation of the Couvade Syndrome as well as the initiation or relapse of Bipolar Disorder in males. It seems that males are not less influenced by hormonal and psycho-social factors posed upon them during the peripartum period of their cohabiting female spouse.",

Emotional dysregulation can express itself both as emotional instability (i.e. an inability to modulate affects than can become uncontrolled) or in terms of poor emotional awareness (i.e. emotional numbing, alexithymic features). Whereas the first dimension is closely related to symptoms, such as impulsivity, suicidal behaviours or inappropriate anger, the latter can be associated with dissociative experiences and chronic feeling of emptiness. Although both dimensions have been related to negative experiences during childhood, however, little is known about the specific developmental pathways leading to emotional instability or emotional awareness in borderline adolescents.

      "abstract": "Deep dyspareunia refers to pain with deep penetration or insertion into the vagina, which affects quality of life. The aim of this narrative review was to examine how the underlying conditions that give rise to deep dyspareunia, and the symptoms of these conditions, can affect sexual function and quality of life beyond the deep dyspareunia itself. For example, deep dyspareunia may be associated with gynecological pathologies that cause cyclical pain symptoms (e.g. dysmenorrhea, dyschezia/dysuria), resulting in quality of life changes related to menstrual cycle events such as ovulation or menstruation. Recurrent dysmenorrhea can cause hyperalgesic priming that sensitizes the nervous system, leading to chronic pelvic pain that can be exacerbated with sexual activity. The coexistence of functional bowel or bladder disorders can result in urgency and frequency that affect the sexual response cycle. Myofascial/musculoskeletal origins of deep dyspareunia may affect body positioning during sexual activity. Central nervous system sensitization can underlie these different factors, and also be associated with mental health conditions, which together can cause symptomatology across body systems that can affect all aspects of one's sexual life. Recognition and management of the far-reaching impacts of deep dyspareunia and its associated comorbidities may be important in clinical care to meaningfully improve quality of life. Future research should include a comprehensive empirical validation of the hypotheses and potential mechanisms in this review.",

      "abstract": "The majority of first-episode psychoses are preceded by a prodromal phase that is several years on average, frequently leads to some decline in psychosocial functioning and offers the opportunity for early detection within the framework of an indicated prevention. To this, two approaches are currently mainly followed. The ultra-high-risk (UHR) criteria were explicitly developed to predict first-episode psychosis within 12 months, and indeed the majority of conversions in clinical UHR samples seem to occur within the first 12 months of initial assessment. Their main criterion, the attenuated psychotic symptoms criterion, captures symptoms that resemble positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. delusions, hallucinations and formal thought disorders) with the exception that some level of insight is still maintained, and these frequently compromise functioning already. In contrast, the basic symptom criteria try to catch patients at increased risk of psychoses at the earliest possible time, i.e. ideally when only the first subtle disturbances in information processing have developed that are experienced with full insight and do not yet overload the person's coping abilities, and thus have not yet resulted in any functional decline. First results from prospective studies not only support this view, but indicate that the combination of both approaches might be a more favorable way to increase sensitivity and detect risk earlier, as well as to establish a change-sensitive risk stratification approach.",

People with OCD try to block these thoughts, making them worse because their brain has to think about the thing to remember to block it out, and tend to believe the experience is evidence that they are bad (or risky, abnormal, perverse).

      "title": "THERAPY IN INVOLUTIONAL MELANCHOLIA",
      "abstract": "(1) There must be in the minds of medical men a sharp differentiation between the psychosis involutional melancholia and the benign \"menopausal symptoms\" common to both females and males at the climacteric. (2) The endocrine factors incident to change of life are not the important etiological or precipitating factors in the psychosis. In only 24 per cent of 53 women did there seem to be any relationship between the onset of menopause and the onset of the psychosis. (3) Life long restrictions of the personality and traits deeply rooted in the psychobiology of the individual are more significant than physiological factors in the etiology of involutional melancholia. The psychosis appears to be the culmination of many forces operating throughout the life history of the patient. (4) Metrazol therapy, which in nearly 73 per cent brings about favorable change classifiable as \"recovery\" or as \"social remission,\" is the most successful treatment thus far developed. Unmodified metrazol therapy with its serious hazards probably cannot continue as a standard method. Because of the poor prognosis in involutional melancholia (30 per cent in 300 cases at the Pennsylvania Hospital) some form of convulsive shock therapy seems justifiable, especially if the newer modifications of metrazol treatment or electric shock prove helpful in reducing the traumatic risk without interfering with the effectiveness of the treatment. Although brilliant recoveries are occasionally recorded in long standing cases of involutional melancholia, our results indicate that promptness is an important factor in the success of treatment. (5) Prolonged narcosis has been helpful in a small number of cases and has given rise to no serious complications. It should be tested further in a larger number of cases. (6) Estrogenic therapy in female involutional melancholia patients has no favorable effect on the course of the psychosis. Stilbestrol is a potent estrogenic substance and when administered orally is capable of producing estrin saturation as evidenced by the changes in urinary APH and estrin values, by the induced uterine bleeding, and by other clinical signs of estrin effect. (7) Testosterone administered by intramuscular injection in male involutionals is capable of producing sexual stimulation, a general improvement in physical well being, and may reduce symptoms arising from benign prostatic hypertrophy. Its beneficial effect in the psychotic stages is questionable, but some improvement has been noted in two men with early involutional melancholia. (8) Parathormone administered hypodermically in twice daily doses of 50 and 100 units, together with calcium and ammonium chloride, increases serum calcium levels. This therapy has no effect on the clinical course of the disorder. (9) Mental hygiene efforts to dislodge the fixed, unwholesome, personality patterns at the moment of recognition may do much to prevent the development of involutional melancholia. Time favors the mental hygienist since even after the appearance of prodromal symptoms there is a period of long germination, shown in our studies to be six months or more in 86 per cent of cases. (10) This psychosis numerically seventh in importance and shown to have a low recovery rate has been much neglected by psychiatrists until recent years. This paper is intended to stress not only active therapeutic measures in the psychosis, but, also, the great importance of early recognition of the prodromal symptoms. We have pointed out the outstanding features of the prepsychotic personality and have stressed opportunities for mental hygiene.",

We tested our clinical observation that development of disruptive agitation is more likely in semantic than in nonfluent PPA and examined which clinical variables could be associated with this behavior.We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychiatric scores and the need for behavioral treatments in semantic PPA (n = 41) and nonfluent PPA (n = 39) cases and compared first (1-3 years since the onset of symptoms) and last (5-13 years since the onset) evaluations. Clinical variables and laterality of temporal atrophy were associated with symptoms in semantic PPA cases.The semantic PPA group developed more frequent (p = 0.03) and intense agitation (p = 0.0008) and had a greater need for antipsychotic drugs (p = 0.001) than the nonfluent PPA group. Presence of agitation was clearly associated with psychotic symptoms (delusions/hallucinations) but was not associated with gender, age at onset, duration of the disease, or laterality of temporal atrophy. In contrast, nonfluent PPA cases were more frequently depressed and treated with antidepressants (p = 0.0007). There were no differences in anxiety, irritability, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, or abnormal motor behavior.Semantic PPA in advanced disease is frequently associated with agitation and psychotic symptoms with fewer mood symptoms, while nonfluent PPA maintains a high prevalence of depression. This implies different treatment and care and support needs for each group.",

      "title": "Eating disorders and sexual function",
      "abstract": "Women suffering from eating disorders, present considerable retardation and difficulties in their psychosexual development during adolescence. This leads to primary or secondary insufficiencies in their adult sexual life. The cause of these difficulties seems to be a series of biological, family and psychosocial factors. The majority of the research findings indicate that eating disorders have a negative impact on the patient's sexual function. The factors related to eating disorders symptomatology that influence sexuality are various and differ among each eating disorder diagnostic categories. Considering anorexia nervosa, it has been reported that women have negative attitudes to sexual issues and their body. Their sexual motivation increases when they engage in psychotherapy and their body weight is gradually restored. Starvation and its consequences on the human physiology and especially on the brain function seem to be the main factor that leads to reduced sexual desire and scarce sexual activity. Moreover, personality traits that are common in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa such as compulsivity and rigidity are also related with difficulties initiating and retaining romantic and sexual relationships. Usually patients suffering from anorexia nervosa report impaired sexual behavior and lack of interest to engage in a sexual relationship. Considering Bulimia Nervosa, impulsivity and difficulties in emotion regulation that are common features of the individuals that suffer from bulimia nervosa are also related to impulsive and sometimes self-harming sexual behaviors. Moreover women sufferers often report repulsion, anger and shame towards their body and weight, mainly due to the distorted perception that they are fat and ugly. It is interesting that a number of research findings indicate that although patients suffering from bulimia nervosa are more sexually active and have more sexual experiences than patients suffering from anorexia nervosa, both groups of patients report more often than general population a lack of satisfaction from their sexual experiences. Other factors that are common to eating disorders and sexual dysfunction are personality traits, negative body-image, adverse childhood experiences, negative family climate and especially early traumatic experiences such as sexual abuse. Furthermore, comorbidity of eating disorders with depression may have a negative impact on the patient's sexual function. The treatment and improvement of sexual behavior is quite problematic when the patient is also suffering from an eating disorder. Eating Disorder patients are often very reluctant to discuss their sexual life with the therapist and to engage in any kind of therapeutic intervention. Comorbidity with a number of other disorders makes psychotherapy even more difficult for those patients. Furthermore, a considerable percentage of Anorexia Nervosa patients do not have any kind of sexual activity, at least until nutrition and weight are restored.",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

It can be caused by an aberration of a body’s physiology, psychological factors, or a rather complicated interplay of both. Whereas current treatment options for ED are primarily focused on medical choices, a biopsychosocial approach is a more logical option for this often multifactorial condition. In this article, we offer information about erectile functioning, provide a DSM-IV-TR interpretation of ED, and discuss a biopsychosocial approach to ED treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

      "abstract": "Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder is characterized with unwanted, uncontrollable and persistent genital arousal symptoms that occur spontaneously in the absence of simultaneous sexual fantasy, sexual desire or sexual stimulation. The condition may last for hours or days. Patients often find it difficult to share this condition with their health care providers because they are afraid of being diagnosed with hypersexuality and they often get different psychiatric diagnoses such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. Therefore, little is known about the real prevalence, pathophysiology or etiology of Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. In addition, since there is no study conducted in this field, our information in this area is limited to case reports. Although there is no consensus about the treatment of Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder in the psychiatric literature, there are some case reports about the use of pregabaline, clomipramine, duloxetine, clonazepam, varenicline, olanzapine, risperidone in addition to the case reports on treatment with hypnotherapy, pelvic floor physiotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this case report, we aimed to present the detailed description of a successful treatment procedure with duloxetine in a forty two years old female patient diagnosed with Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder. She had been using various antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and mood stabilizers for sixteen years with different psychiatric misdiagnoses like Bipolar Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder and yet, had not shared her symptoms of genital arousal with any psychiatrist previously.",

They are mainly nocturnal and often progress to convulsions. Consciousness is usually impaired from onset or during the ictus. By definition, seizures lasting for more than half an hour are status epilepticus. In one third of these children, the phase of deviation of the eyes with vomiting and impairment of consciousness is prolonged for more than 30 minutes (partial status epilepticus) and usually ends with generalised convulsions. A typical case is of a child who wakes up from sleep agitated, vomiting, eyes deviated to one side, and who may or may not be able to communicate for minutes to hours before hemiconvulsions or generalised convulsions begin. Onset is between 1–12 years, peak is at 5 years, and remission occurs within 1–2 years from onset. In one third of the patients, seizures or even partial status epilepticus are single events in the child’s life.

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw.

Most short-term treatment-related side effects of SSRIs are transient and disappear after a few days or weeks. However, following long-term treatment with the SSRIs, some serious adverse events may occur. Some of them can be difficult to recognise because they can resemble residual symptoms of depression. The most serious can be life threatening. They all have a negative influence on the patient’s quality of life and are frequently a prime reason for a lack of long-term compliance with the associated increased risk of recurrence of a depressive episode.

      "abstract": "El trastorno depresivo mayor es un desorden heterogéneo y multifactorial caracterizado por episodios de al menos dos semanas de duración, en los cuales se presente al menos uno de los dos síntomas centrales. Estos son: 1.- Estado de ánimo depresivo con pérdida de interés por las actividades cotidianas y 2.- Ausencia de la capacidad de sentir placer (anhedonia). Estos síntomas traen consigo trastornos anímicos, cognitivos y fisiológicos y en los casos más severos, pueden asociarse a conductas suicidas. Si bien en la actualidad la etiología del trastorno depresivo mayor es poco conocida, se ha reportado que tanto la presencia de neuroinflamación como la reducción de la neurogénesis hipocampal adulta son eventos claves en el desarrollo de esta patología. Las terapias actuales para el trastorno depresivo mayor no están enfocadas en estas alteraciones, lo que podría explicar el alto porcentaje de refractariedad al tratamiento de pacientes con trastorno depresivo mayor frente a la terapia convencional. Por este motivo, se ha propuesto como una opción de tratamiento el uso de células madre mesenquimáticas (MSC), las cuales son capaces de producir de manera paracrina, una gran variedad de moléculas terapéuticas entre las que se encuentran moléculas anti-inflamatorias y factores neuroprotectores inductores de la neurogénesis. Estas moléculas secretadas por las MSC se pueden recuperar desde el medio de cultivo celular y en conjunto reciben el nombre de secretoma. Este trabajo se basó en la evaluación del potencial antidepresivo de la administración intranasal repetida de secretoma derivado de MSC en un modelo animal de trastorno depresivo mayor instaurado en el bioterio de la Universidad del Desarrollo. En conjunto, los datos obtenidos muestran que el tratamiento intranasal con secretoma derivado de MSC fue capaz de revertir algunas de las conductas asociadas a estados depresivos en animales, disminuyendo significativamente el puntaje global de depresión en comparación a los animales tratados con vehículo. A nivel estructural el modelo animal de depresión utilizado no mostró presencia de alteraciones del proceso de neurogenesis hipocampal adulta pero sí mostró neuroinflamación, evidenciada en un aumento de la densidad de astrocitos a nivel del hipocampo en comparación a los animales control. Este aumento no se observó en los animales tratados con secretoma intranasal, sugiriendo un efecto anti-inflamatorio del biofármaco. Adicionalmente, se observó que el secretoma derivado de MSC ejerció un efecto protector sobre los astrocitos inhibiendo el proceso de atrofia de sus prolongaciones. Los datos pre-clínicos obtenidos sugieren que la administración intranasal de secretoma derivado de células madre mesenquimáticas representa un tratamiento potencialmente eficaz para reducir los síntomas de depresión en humanos y una posible alternativa terapéutica a los tratamientos actuales para esta devastadora patología",

The lack of awareness of this head pain may possibly be due to its rarity and problems with making the diagnosis. In the present work, the long‐term result of minor, decompressive surgery of the supraorbital nerve in five patients is reported. The immediate improvement was good and, after a mean observation time of more than 6 years, an improvement of 50% to 100% was observed (mean, circa 85%). In the two patients with the longest postoperative observation time, approximately 8 years, pain has not recurred. The pain was severe, leading to suicidal thoughts in several patients. The long‐term course was intermittent or continuous. The pain was generally unilateral, but was bilateral in one patient. Generally, there was lack of, or only minor benefit from drug treatment, including carbamazepine and indomethacin. There was clearly tenderness over the supraorbital nerve, especially at its outlet, and in some subjects occasionally, a slight local loss of sensation. Definite trigger zones were not present. Supraorbital nerve blockade generally provided instant and considerable pain relief. The persistence of protracted unilateral forehead/ocular pain, tenderness over the nerve, and repeated blockade effect strongly suggests the diagnosis.",

Uma manifestação deste fenômeno é a demência, síndrome clínica comum a partir dos 65 anos, e caracterizada por deterioro persistente de funções mentais com alterações da capacidade do indivíduo de realizar as atividades diárias sem sofrem de alterações no nível de sua consciência. As necessidades de atender solicitações oriundas conflitos sociais é uma das manifestações que é psicologia jurídica tem diante de si na atualidade. Como ponto de partida a possibilidade de apresentar informações capazes de levar uma tomada de decisão com menor limitação frente exigências sociais. O processo pericial em psicologia procura apresentar informações da funcionalidade da efetividade e da capacidade adaptativa diante da solicitação social de um determinado indivíduo identificando possíveis alterações ou mesmo manutenção da sua higidez psicológica. Os psicólogos que trabalham em processos periciais precisam ficar atentos às características e manifestações sintomáticas e de desadaptação de comportamento apresentadas pelo avaliando, sem perder a perspectiva do desenvolvimento e os processos vitais relacionados. A elaboração e a construção de novos instrumentais, de protocolos e de procedimentos técnicos científicos relacionados a medida e a avaliação de condições psicossociais, podem nortear e embasar as ações profissionais, reduzindo ou mesmo minimizando os riscos associados quanto as tomadas de decisão, identificadas como comprometimentos de funções psicológicas.",

      "title": "Subjective, Objective, or Both?",
      "abstract": "Abstract The terms subjective and objective often appear in health care records, and one commonly hears about “subjective symptoms” and “objective complaints”—yet the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron. Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

      "title": "Whiplash headache: Does the diagnosis make more harm than the whiplash?",
      "abstract": "According to the study of Obermann et al. in the current issue of Cephalalgia, headache after whiplash injury is a self-limiting condition with a good prognosis. Although 4.6% fulfilled criteria for chronic whiplash headache, i.e. still having headache after 3 months, none had headache lasting more than 1 year. Predictors for headache lasting > 3 months were medication overuse, pre-existing pain conditions, and several psychological factors. Another factor, sore throat after the whiplash, was somewhat speculatively interpreted as a possible result of musculoskeletal damage. The headaches were mostly compatible with tension-type headache (TTH). Although the study has a positive message, that the headache subsides in less than a year, it also demonstrates some very problematic aspects of the whiplash headache entity. First, the criteria contain no description of the headache itself. It is sufficient that the headache and neck pain occur within 7 days after an event with a possible whiplash mechanism. For the chronic whiplash headache, it is required that the headache persists for > 3 months after the accident, but there is no requirement that the headache occurs with a certain frequency. This is in contrast to, for example, chronic TTH, where the headache must occur on more than half of the days for > 3 months. Quite wisely, therefore, the authors have in their definition of chronic headache added the requirement that the headache shall occur daily or near daily. Nevertheless, to find enough patients with ‘chronic’ headache for the analysis, they also used the criteria of the Quebec task force (QTF), but also these criteria have no definition of chronicity. An even more problematic aspect of the chronic whiplash headache entity is that, according to the very lax International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) criteria, in principle any headache that occurs in an individual for years after the event can be classified as chronic whiplash headache, provided that there was head and neck pain during the first week. This is so even though this single event leaves no trace in the body that can be demonstrated by objective means, and even if the headache resembles the naturally occurring primary headaches, as demonstrated in this and previous studies (1,2). This issue is even more crucial after the demonstration that even sham whiplash accidents, involving virtually no physical forces but many psychological stressors, could induce head and neck pain in up to 20% of the exposed individuals within the first days after the event (3), hence allowing a diagnosis of whiplash headache according to the current ICHD-II criteria. Thus, it may be that so-called whiplash headache mostly or even exclusively represents primary headache induced by the stress of the situation (2). Theoretically, it is highly unsatisfactory to have a headache category named after each type of precipitant for headache episodes, psychological or other. From a practical viewpoint, it is probably unsound to name the headache after the whiplash event if the headache is a primary headache, particularly since most patients and health professionals will then tend to understand the aetiology in terms of a physical injury to head and neck structures. Many unhealthy practices (e.g. use of a neck collar, hazardous neck operations) that may increase the complaints stem from a traumatic conception of the headache, and the prognosis of headache after rear-end collisions seems to be best in cultures where the traumatic event is ignored (4). In the present study the incidence of chronic headache is consistent with the prevalence figures of chronic headache seen in population-based studies, and the authors wisely comment that development of chronicity in this whiplash group may have similar pathophysiological or clinical mechanisms to chronic headache in general. In my opinion, this raises the issue of whether whiplash headache is a biologically meaningful entity, i.e. caused by injury to head or neck structures. To solve this problem, descriptive case series based on patients presenting in an emergency room or to a",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

To many patients (47%) the delusional theme remains unchanged from the start and from one psychotic episode to another, while to other patients (24%) the theme changes in a hierarchical way. It is suggested that the formation of delusional beliefs is caused by impaired two-way communication or metathinking and that the delusional theme indicates the severity of cognitive dysfunction or mental disorder.",

Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support.

      "title": "Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "abstract": "Summary Twelve psychotic reactions are reported in 11 patients with various somatic illnesses treated with ACTH and/or cortisone. Two major patterns occurred: (a) A primarily affective disorder, either manic or depressive; and, more frequently, (b) an organic reaction (toxic psychosis) with associated paranoid-hallucinatory and/or affective (usually depressive) components. No consistent correlation could be obtained with regard to drug dosage and onset, duration, or type of psychosis. Suicidal tendencies were present in several cases. After the ACTH or cortisone was discontinued, termination of the psychosis occurred spontaneously in the organic reactions. The affective disorders required electroconvulsive therapy. A comparison is made between these states and psychoses appearing in naturally occurring hyperadrenalism or Cushing's syndrome. The following factors involved in the production of these psychotic reactions are considered significant: The physiological effects of the hyperadrenal state on the central nervous system. The influence of the underlying disease process. The premorbid personality. Only in a few cases were recognizable psychotic trends present before treatment. It is felt that in most instances the previous personality pattern determined the psychological content of the psychosis, but not its onset. A complete understanding of the interrelationships of all of these physiological and psychological mechanisms is not possible at the present time.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Quality of life (QOL) is often reduced in patients with chronic diseases. Sexual activity and enjoyment constitute an important aspect of QOL. Sexuality is a neglected area of QOL in patients with rheumatic disease. Sexual problems among patients are common and often increase with disease duration. Both disease related factors and the psychological response to chronic disease can impair sexual functioning. General disease symptoms like pain, fatigue, disease activity, and impaired physical function contribute to reduced sexual activity in both genders. However, psychological factors like depression, anxiety, negative body image and low self-esteem play an important role. Sexual dysfunction can create frustration and distress, and if chronic increase anxiety and depression, and damage interpersonal relationships. Sexual health is rarely addressed by health professionals (HP), and it is as a rule not spontaneously reported by patients. HPs may feel awkward to intrude into the intimate sphere of a patient, and patients may feel ashamed of revealing their sexual dysfunction. A first step to improve the physician-patient communication in this area is to include sexuality in the curriculum of health professionals teaching how to address and evaluate sexual function. Assessment of sexual function by validated instruments includes both frequency of intercourse as well as sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction. In women vaginal lubrication and in men erectile function and ejaculation are part of the evaluation. Assessment of disease activity and comorbidities helps to detect physical components of sexual dysfunction. Barriers regarding communication on sexual activity should be identified and overcome. Assessment of sexual function may be assigned to a specially trained nurse, an occupational therapist or a psychologist of the interdisciplinary team. Referral to specialists in urology, gynaecology or sexual medicine may also help patients to get a better sex life. A major point for restoring sexual and reproductive health in patients of both genders is to achieve optimal disease control. <h3>Reference</h3> [1] Østensen M.

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "abstract": "Résumé1. Une étude des données épidémiologiques met en lumière le rapport qui existe entre les formes plus graves des états dépressifs et la fin de l'âge mûr la vieillesse et la feminité.2. L'expérience acquise grâce aux traitements physiques utilisés en psychiatrie au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années confirme dans l'ensemble l'existence de deux types comparativement distincts d'état dépressif, l'un basé sur une prédisposition spécifique, l'autre sur une vulnérabilité générale vis-à-vis de laquelle les individus ne diffèrent qu'au point de vue du degré. Ces deux groupes diffèrent quant à leur image clinique—son inconstance et ses conséquences aussi bien que par le type de prédisposition—plutôt que par la présence ou l'absence de causes environnantes de la maladie.3. Le rapport entre les états anxieux et les états dépressifs est discuté avec mention particulière d'un nouveau syndrome qui habituellement se manifeste tout à coup après un malheur ou une grave maladie physique. Ce dérangement est plus fréquent chez les femmes qui auraient tendance à être rigides et dépendantes d'autrui. Le noyau même de la maladie est une dépersonnalisation qui se combine avec une forme caractérisée de phobie anxieuse; cette combinaison se trouve accompagnée de symptômes plus variables de dépression, d'obsession, d'hystérie, d'hypocondrie et parfois de psychose de courte durée. Les symptômes de dépression peuvent être plus évidents particulièrement chez des malades plus âgées—mais un traitement d'électrochoc ne fait habituellement qu'aggraver la maladie. On considère que les faits connus sont à l'encontre du concept d'une seule et unique famille des maladies affectives où les différents types de réactions se fondraient insensiblement les uns dans les autres.4. Les observations récentes ne confirment pas le concept d'un état dépressif d'un type spécifiquement involutif. Mais des preuves permettraient de suggérer que ceux qui passent par un état dépressif pour la première fois à un âge avancé sont moins prédisposés de naissance aux dépressions nerveuses que ceux dont la maladie s'est révélée quand ils étaient plus jeunes. Dans le premier cas une force exogène est le point de départ le plus fréquent et la dépression se complique souvent de troubles physiques, particulièrement chez les hommes.5. Le rapport qui existe entre d'infimes altérations de la conscience et certaines formes de réactions dépressives est discuté en se basant particulièrement sur les psychoses 'psychogènes', les états dits 'schizophréniformes', les psychoses des épileptiques et des alcooliques et les symptômes affectifs associés avec les maladies somatiques aiguës.6. Discussion du rapport qui existe entre les symptômes d'hypocondrie et d'ob-session et les états dépressifs. Plus les symptômes précédents seront prononcés en relation avec l'état dépressif, plus le cours de la maladie et la réaction au traitement seront éloignés de ceux de la dépression endogène. Il est suggéré que l'hypocondrie existe en tant que telle aussi bien qu'en tant de symptôme d'un état dépressif. Description de quelques formes cliniques de cette maladie.7. Les états de dépression sont parmi les plus communs des maux humains. L'incidence morbide des seuls cas endogènes est d'environ 1–2%, ce qui implique une plus grande fréquence que pour toute autre maladie provoquée par un mécanisme génétique spécifique. L'auteur met ces faits en relation avec la psychopathologie et avec la signification biologique des états dépressifs.",

      "title": "Pharmacologic Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis–Related Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most common symptom of multiple sclerosis and is perhaps the symptom with the most devastating impact on patient well-being. It is reported by 75% to 95% of individuals, and more than half describe it as the worst symptom of the disease. The mechanisms underlying the development of fatigue remain unclear; although fatigue is believed to be a primary symptom of MS (ie, related to the demyelinating processes of the disease), fatigue may also occur secondarily to factors such as sleep disturbances, depression, or the effects of medications. The highly variable presentation of MS and the number of agents used for disease modification and symptom management make it important for potential contributors to MS-related fatigue to be identified and managed appropriately. If fatigue continues despite elimination or adequate management of secondary causes, pharmacologic therapy may be required. Several agents have been reported to improve MS-related fatigue; however, only three have been investigated in controlled trials. Amantadine has been studied in several small controlled trials, and appears to be effective in one quarter to one third of those with mild-to-moderate fatigue. It has shown efficacy on a number of scales, including the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue (VAS-F) and the MS-Specific Fatigue Scale (MS-FS). The central nervous system (CNS) stimulant pemoline has demonstrated limited benefit in clinical trials and is often poorly tolerated, especially in higher doses. Recently, the wake-promoting agent modafinil has been shown to significantly improve MS-related fatigue on a number of commonly used fatigue assessment scales, including the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS).",

Personality, cognitive functions, α 2 and imidazoline binding, sensitivity to inducement of panic attacks, relative hypothyroidism, and some but not all serotonergic functions of women with dysphoric PMS differ from those with no PMS, and also differ during a non‐symptomatic phase of the cycle. It is suggested that premenstrual symptoms are an expression of vulnerability traits that might surface in response to a trigger. Such traits are probably diverse, and the nature of the symptoms might depend upon the underlying trait. It is postulated that some vulnerability traits to specific premenstrual syndromes might also be vulnerability traits to depression or anxiety in general.",

Common presentations include: (1) generalized convulsive status epilepticus or complex partial status epilepticus that continue despite initial therapies; (2) stupor or coma following a generalized convulsive or complex partial seizure; or (3) stupor or coma following brain surgery or acute brain injury. When status epilepticus continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the initiation of anesthetic therapy, or recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia, it is termed super RSE. Published evidence on optimal management of RSE consists largely of case reports or small series. The mainstay of treatment is the administration of anesthetic agents titrated to electrographic seizure control. Adjunctive therapies include hypothermia and immunosuppression and less commonly, surgery, electrical stimulation therapies, and induction of ketosis. Patients with cardiopulmonary complications and prolonged duration of drug-induced coma tend to have worse post-treatment functional outcomes. However, significant improvement over time can occur in survivors, and thus treatment is justified even in patients who require prolonged anesthetic coma. The strongest predictors of outcome are duration of anesthetic coma, etiology, and development of cardiopulmonary complications.",

      "abstract": "La pérdida de un ser querido puede dar lugar a un duelo complicado, caracterizado por intensos síntomas de anhelo, tristeza o pérdida de sentido. La identificación del duelo complicado es central para poder ofrecer tratamientos adecuados. Sin embargo, no se conoce con claridad el perfil sintomatológico, ni la influencia que tienen el tipo de pérdida en la intensidad del duelo. En este estudio descriptivo participaron un total de 68 personas que habían sufrido una pérdida, al menos seis meses antes de la evaluación. Completaron una batería de pruebas sobre intensidad del duelo y psicopatología. Los resultados señalan que todas las variables psicopatológicas mostraron altas relaciones significativas con la intensidad de síntomas de duelo. La centralidad con que se percibió la pérdida y los sentimientos de hostilidad predijeron en gran medida los valores de duelo complicado y con mayor intensidad de experiencias de duelo y de síntomas psicopatológicos. El perfil sintomatológico en duelo complicado se relaciona con un gran abanico de psicopatología. La pérdida de un hijo parece ser un importante factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de duelo complicado. The loss of a loved one may provoke complicated grief, which is characterized by intense symptoms of yearning, sadness, or loss of life meaning. Identifying those at risk of developing complicated grief is crucial to provide adequate treatment. However, little is known about the symptom profile or the influence that the type of loss may have on grief intensity. A descriptive design was carried out. A total of 68 participants that have lost a loved one due to death, at least six months ago, took part on the research. They completed a range of emotional self-report measures. All psychopathological variables showed high and significant relations with the intensity of grief. The centrality perceived and feelings of hostility predicted the score of complicated grief. Finally, the loss of a son was associated with complicated grief and with higher scores on the experiences of loss and emotional psychopathology. Symptom profile of those with complicated grief is associated with a large number of psychopathological variables, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. The loss of a son seems to be an important risk factor for developing complicated grief.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Aspects of Osteoporosis",
      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is defined as a reduction in bone mass associated with increased skeletal fragility. By far, fractures are the most clinically significant aspect of the osteoporotic syndrome. Compression fractures in the midthoracic and upper lumbar region of the spine lead to chronic back pain, reduction in physical activity, body deformity, muscle weakness, and fatigue. In general, the principal therapeutic end point for judging the efficacy of treatment is a reduction in fracture rate. Perhaps of more importance, however, to the patient is a diminution of symptoms associated with the consequences of fracture. These changes would be expected to lead to an improvement in quality of life for that individual (1,2). Not all individuals are symptomatic from osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine, and the proportion of patients with vertebral osteoporosis who suffer morbid consequences is unknown (3). Women with severe osteoporosis are at consistently higher risk of having any symptoms, compared with women with mild osteoporosis or no osteoporosis (4). The risk of pain and disability increases with the number and severity of fractures, and individuals with prevalent fractures have an increased risk of back pain and physical disability, which persists for 3 years or more on average (4, 5). To what degree the severity of osteoporotic symptoms affects the psychosocial status of patients is not well understood. Because patients may not openly discuss their emotions and concerns about living with this disease, the psychosocial status of all patients needs to be assessed. A key therapeutic strategy is to identify and address the individual psychosocial needs of each patient, so a renewed sense of life satisfaction might be achieved while coping with a chronic, painful disease.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "title": "Critical appraisal of estrogen (replacement) therapy on mood and cognition",
      "abstract": "The occurrence of depressive symptoms in the perimenopause is associated with a variety of factors. A previous history of either depression and or pre-menstrual syndrome as well as cognitive factors explain most of the variance. There are no consistent findings of a correlation between any serum hormone level and severity or presence of mood symptoms. Neurobiological studies show, with regard to an antidepressant effect, promising effects of estradiol on serotonergic, noradrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic and GABAergic functions. Progestogens seem to oppose many of these effects. The role of adrenergic hormones and DHEA(S) is less clear. Most clinical trials showed a modest effect on symptoms of depression. However, the predominantly poor methodological quality does not allow generalisation and recommendations. A “tonic“ effect on well-being in non- or mild depressed women should not be regarded as true antidepressant effect. Results yielded in studies of surgically menopausal women may not be applicable to women with natural menopause. With regard to the domino theory, future studies should also focus on the mediation of treatment effects through alleviation of vasomotor symptoms or sleep quality. With regard to the dementias, the large Womens' Health Initiative revealed an increased risk of cognitive impairment in women 65 y and older treated with estrogen plus progestin. The estrogen only trial is still going on. Even before starting this trial, the available clinical and epidemiological database revealed no relevant effects (except for some verbal functions) in already demented patients and on normal neuropsychological symptoms of ageing. Whether estrogen treatment in earlier periods (e.g. perimenopause) or the endogenous hormone production reduce the risk of dementia in later life, is not clear yet. Overall, pathophysiological interactions of a variety of biological, psychological and social factors must be taken into account when studying the effects on mood and cognition.",

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect.

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pathologic examination of the epileptic brain tissue showed focal cortical dysplasia. The patient has been seizure-free and asymptomatic for more than 5 years after resection. There were no operative complications. The patient’s behavior and neurocognitive performance have improved markedly, and he is now employed and does not require supervision. Also, there has been a pronounced reduction in the adverse effects of antiepileptic drug medication. Partial or localization-related epilepsy is the most common seizure disorder. Approximately 90% of the adult incident cases of epilepsy have recurrent and unprovoked partial seizures. An estimated 20% of patients with epilepsy have an intractable seizure disorder, that is, pharmacoresistant seizures that are physically and socially disabling. Coexisting comorbid conditions associated with an intractable seizure disorder often include cognitive impairment, behavioral problems, psychosocial isolation, and the inability to operate a motor vehicle or to be gainfully employed. Patients with medically refractory seizures may also require a supervised living situation or caregiver. A prognostic indicator for an unfavorable response to antiepileptic drug therapy is the identification of a structural lesion as the cause of the seizure disorder. Potential alternative forms of therapy for patients with intractable epilepsy include the use of newer antiepileptic drug medications, surgical treatment, and vagus nerve stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Follow-up studies of children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder show that they continue to have problems with restlessness, over-activity, impulsive behaviour and inattention, often resulting in serious academic, social and emotional problems in adolescence. Outcome in adulthood generally falls into three groups: fairly normal outcome, persistent attentional, social, emotional and impulse problems, and serious psychiatric and/or social pathology. Factors affecting outcome include characteristics related to the child (for example, health, temperament, IQ) and characteristics of the family (for example, socioeconomic status, emtional and psychological aspects of the family, family composition and structure, and the larger social and physical environment.",

In addition to the diagnostic impairments specified in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria for ASD in socialization, restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, and communi‐ cation, which must be present in the early developmental period, many individuals diagnosed with an ASD frequently have co-morbid aggression and severe irritability, hyperactivity, and repetitive behaviors, which can become a major source of additional distress and can interfere with functioning [2]. Similarly, others have observed the occurrence of co-morbid conditions among individuals diagnosed with an ASD as follows: hyperactivity (67%), sensory processing problems (85%), anxiety/fear (74%), behavioral problems (89%), and obsessive-compulsive behaviors (92%) [3]. These investigators described that behavioral problems and obsessivecompulsive behaviors were reported to be the most serious and problematic. In addition, investigators described that some individuals diagnosed with an ASD show significant deterioration in symptoms about the time of puberty [4]. Among the symptoms that worsened according to these investigators were disruptive behavior, destructiveness, restlessness, and partial loss of acquired social and academic skills.",

      "title": "AB54. Pathophysiology of premature ejaculation and serotonin",
      "abstract": "According to the epidemiologic studies conducted so far, premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual dysfunction in younger men (<30 years); its prevalence is higher than that of ED, and varies from 9% and up to 31% of the male population. The etiology of PE is uncertain in almost all cases, and might include a combination of organic and psychogenic factors. Negative conditioning and penile hypersensitivity are the most frequently cited etiological factors in PE, although neither mechanism has received adequate experimental support to date. Accordingly from a scientific perspective, it is fair to state that PE pathophysiology is largely unknown.\r\n\r\nSerotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter. Biochemically derived from tryptophan, serotonin is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), platelets, and the central nervous system (CNS) of animals, including humans. It is popularly thought to be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness. There are currently 15 known 5-HT receptor subtypes, which are grouped into seven major classes (5-HT1–7). With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor, all 5-HT receptors are coupled to second messengers by G proteins. All 5-HT receptors have been reported to exist postsynaptically. Although some authors have suggested the existence of facilitatory 5-HT3 autoreceptors, only the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes (5-HT1A and 5-HT1B) are widely accepted to function as presynaptic autoreceptors. At least three of the 5-HT receptor subtypes have a role in ejaculation: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors. Activation of postsynaptic 5-HT2C or 5-HT1B receptors prolongs ejaculatory latency, whereas activation of presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which inhibits 5-HT release, decreases ejaculatory latency. Subcutaneous administration of the 5-HT1B receptor agonists anpirtoline and m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine and systemic, acute administration of the 5-HT2C agonist 2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine have been shown to impair ejaculation in rats. Based on the role of 5-HT neurotransmission in the physiology of ejaculatory control and possibly in the pathogenesis of PE, and because SSRI antidepressants have the well-established side-effect of delaying ejaculation when used to treat depressed patients, currently marketed SSRIs such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline, which increase synaptic 5-HT concentration via blockade of 5-HT transporters, have been investigated in numerous clinical studies for managing PE. Paroxetine and sertraline have provided significant benefits in patients with PE, either via daily administration or on-demand use before intercourse, and fluoxetine has shown some efficacy for PE as continuously dosed therapy. Although none of these agents has received an indication for the treatment of PE, current guidelines from the AUA and recommendations from the Second International Consultation on Sexual Dysfunctions recommend the off-label use of SSRIs for managing PE.",

The prevalence of subjective health complaints is very high, with at least 75% of the population reporting one or more subjective health complaints the past 30 days. From a statistical point of view, it is \"normal\" to have complaints. It is when they become intolerable that assistance is required.

In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both. The spells are said to be an early infantile form of temper tantrum—a primitive expression of anger or frustration. Such being the case,",

      "title": "Depression and the apathy symptom are associated with poorer cognitive functioning in very old men",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Older adults (65+) are among the fastest growing segments of the population, projected to double by 2050. Oldest‐old (85+) manifest the greatest relative increase in population and have the greatest risk of developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Depression is a chronic, debilitating condition in older adults. Depressive symptoms, particularly apathy—and poor concentration—have been associated with poor cognitive functioning and dementia. However, some associations depend upon gender, age of depression onset, and preexisting cognitive impairment; other studies find no association. Associations have been primarily in relatively young samples, and apathy has infrequently been studied in the very old. We investigated the cross‐sectional associations of depressive symptoms and apathy with cognitive functioning in cognitively normal very old men. Methods Participants consisted of 74 cognitively intact male veterans (age = 86 ±5.1 [mean ± SD ], range = 76‐98; 81.1 % White, 18.9% Black; 15‐item Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS] = 2.6 ±2.7, range = 0‐12; 13.5% depressed [GDS ≥ 6]) enrolled in the Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Successful Cognitive Aging in Very Old Male Veterans study. The predictors were the GDS‐15 and the apathy item “Have you dropped many of your activities and interests?” Cognitive outcomes, from factor analysis of 11 neuropsychological test scores, were three Varimax factor cognitive domains (Episodic Memory, Attention, Executive Function), and the first principal component (global cognition). Linear regression analyses adjusted for age and education. Results Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with poorer global cognition (r = ‐.274, p = .020). Apathy was significantly associated with poorer Attention (r = ‐.403, p &lt; .001) and global cognition (r = ‐.377, p = .001). Apathy remained significant after controlling for the sum of other depressive symptoms. Conclusion These results extend others’ findings by showing that depressive symptoms, and specifically apathy, are associated with poorer cognitive functioning in very old men. This study highlights the relevance of examining depressive symptoms as predictors of cognitive functioning. The small effect sizes (r ≤ .097) for memory, the hallmark cognitive symptom of AD, suggest possible non‐AD biological involvement. Future studies with larger and more demographically and ethnically diverse samples are warranted.",

Bipolar illness is transmitted in some families as an X‐linked dominant factor. In other families, X‐linked transmission does not occur. Hence, bipolar illness may be similar to retinitis pigmentosa. This makes some types of genetic counseling difficult to apply to bipolar families. There is no evidence that unipolar depressive illness is transmitted by an X‐linked factor. Family studies indicate that there might be more than one type of unipolar illness. Limited prediction of risk of depression and other psychiatric conditions in other family members can be based on family studies which show that alcoholism and personality disorder occur frequently in families of early onset depressives but much less frequently in families of late onset depressives (age 40 or older).",

      "title": "Tension-type Headache and Migraine as Manifestations of Chronic Post-Traumatic Headache",
      "abstract": "Introduction: A subsequent headache within seven days of a head injury (or after regaining consciousness after the head trauma)is referred to as a post-traumatic headache (PTHA); it is referred to as chronic or chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTHA) if it lasts longer than three months after the injury. Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

      "title": "Drug treatments for schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

      "title": "Child Abuse Syndrome (CAS): A Newly Recognized Distinct Entity",
      "abstract": "A number of children and adolescents experience stressful events during their life spans, which can affect them both physically and emotionally. Their reactions to these events are usually time-limited, as most of these children recover without further problems. However, a child or an adolescent may experience a severe traumatic event, including situations where someone's life (especially parents’ lives) is threatened or where major injuries occur (e.g., victims or witnesses of physical/sexual abuse or of violence in the home or community, of a car accident, a natural disaster or a war event, or the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness); in these cases, the risk of developing a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) becomes more likely, and is directly related to the severity of the trauma experienced, to the likelihood of the trauma being repeated, and, when the trauma affects a child’s relative, also to the child’s relationship with the victim [1, 2].\r\n\r\nThe American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) has recently proved that PTSD related to sexual abuse in children can manifest itself with unique clinical patterns, including specific signs and symptoms of varying degrees of intensity: losing interest in activities which normally gave them joy or pleasure, a regression to thumb-sucking, bedwetting or other age-inappropriate behaviors, also including loss of talking skills. Other leading hallmarks are the tendency to repeat some forms of behavior previously perpetrated against themselves; the development of a strong attachment to a parent or toward another reference figure; the manifestation of unusual fears regarding early death; and severe concentration problems interfering with learning or social activities. Additional potential consequences in adult life include suicidal thinking, active engagement in suicidal behavior and the onset of addictive relationships to food, alcohol or drugs [3, 4].\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years, increasing evidence of the changes in brain structure and function occurring in abused children suffering from PTSD have been recorded by neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, PECT) and neurophysiological (EEG, ERP) studies on large cohorts, mainly including changes in the frontal-limbic networks, the hippocampus and the amygdala [5, 6]. In addition, clinical and molecular geneticists have suggested and demonstrated that abused children who develop PTSD experience a biologically specific form of the disorder different from those caused by other types of trauma, including distinct genomic alterations and unique epigenetic DNA methylation profiles [7, 8].\r\n\r\nAccording to this recent clinical, neuroimaging, neurophysiological, genomic and epigenetic evidence, independently reported by separate teams of researchers, we propose that, for a better and more accurate clinical and diagnostic evaluation and understanding of the clinical phenotype, the overall manifestations and symptoms caused by child abuse be regarded as a specific and distinct entity, grouped under the term of “Child Abuse Syndrome” (CAS).",

      "abstract": "Social phobia is one of the most frequent psychiatric disorders, with a lifetime prevalence rate of about 3-5%. The diagnosis is relatively easy in the classical forms, with a meticulous interview when the context and the patient's complaints are in favour of this condition, but there are various cases in which the symptoms are not typical or in which other diagnoses are in the forefront. In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

Sometimes biological aspects cause SBS, sometimes the chemicals present in your building, but human biological systems are affected. This paper reveal a review of SBS, including symptoms, causes, effects, work-related illnesses, prevention, and control. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) is a medical condition where people experience unexplained symptoms of illness or discomfort while occupying a building. The severity of these symptoms tends to worsen with prolonged stay in the building, but improves or disappears once they leave. SBS can have significant consequences, including: Impaired work or school performance, strained personal relationships, Reduced attendance, Decreased productivity. SBS can occur in various settings, such as: Offices, Homes, Schools, Nurseries. Common symptoms of SBS include: Eye problems (irritation, watering, dryness), Respiratory issues (runny or blocked nose, sore throat), Skin problems (itching, dryness), Headaches, Fatigue, Lethargy, Poor concentration. Overall, SBS can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life and productivity, making it essential to identify and address the underlying causes of the condition.",

Cases may go underdiagnosed, misdirected, or commonly treated inappropriately. Clinical studies have conclusively shown an obvious link between childhood trauma and the emergence of symptoms. Transient dissociative episodes are common and normative phenomena during childhood. We reported a case of an 8-year-old boy, who presented with a 5-day history of hallucinatory behavior. He was causing significant nuisances, sudden onset of shouting aggressively, and behavioral changes, associated with neuropsychiatric presentation such as repetitive irregular movement involving his head, neck, and upper limb. There was an asynchrony of symptoms exhibited which were unexplained by clinical semiology or patterns. He was screaming in fear, talking irrelevantly, and acting suspiciously. This was his first presentation to the hospital and no features to suggest organicity. There was no family history of mental illness. No substances, or alcohol and drug usage Serial investigation turned out to be normal and unremarkable. The episodes get frequent whenever parents or hospital staff give more attention toward him. He was given a low dose of antipsychotics, but no obvious rapid changes were observed afterward. Further exploration noted, his parents reported that the patient had been very worked up with past related trauma at school and constantly talking about it. He was afraid, distressed, and anxious as he felt something bad would happen to him. There were significant issues related to attachment figures in this boy, possibly the absent parenting style. He spent most of time playing online games and was preoccupied with them on a daily basis.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mortality and neurological and mental outcome were studied in infants 28 days to 1 year of age with afebrile seizures not due to an acute postnatal injury. Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history. RÉSUMÉ On a étudiea la mortalité et le pronostic neurologique et intellectuel des enfants ayant eu entre L'âge été 28 jours et celui d'un an plusieurs crises épileptiques sans fiàevre, non liées a une atteinte cérébrale aiguë.

Dans L'ensemble, le pronostic est tràes sëvëre, même quand il ne s'agit pas été spasmes infantiles.

RESUMEN Se ha estudiado la mortalidad y la evolución été los estados neurológico y mental en niños été 28 dias a un ano été edad con convulsiones afebriles no debidas a insulto postnatal. Los casos fueron divididos en 4 tipos été ataques: espasmos infantiles, estatus epilepticus, y “otros” generalizados o parciales (enfermos sin espasmos o status). Durante más été un ano se estudié la mortalidad en 334 casos y el pronéstico mental y neurologico en 313 ninos. El pronostico global fué muy pobre incluso en los casos sin espasmos infantiles. La mortalidad fue más alta y las secuelas neurológicas m^s comunes en los casos sintomaticos que en los criptogenicos. La más alta mortalidad y el mayor niimero été defectos neurolbgicos se encontraron en los status epilepticus y en el grupo été“otros” ataques parciales. Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

The results were: five cases (3.5%) with primary affective disorder (2 with circular type, 1 with depressed type and 2 with involutional melancholia), nine with atypical chronic depression (4 with depressive neurosis and 5 with depressive paranoid reaction), one with successful suicide and three with prominent self-destructive behavior on excessive drinking. The incidence of primary affective disorder in alcoholism approximates to 2 to 4 percent in Japan, and is a little lower than that of U.S.A or of Europe. A characteristic of the clinic for alcoholism was the frequent presentation of atypical or chronic depression. This was usually diagnosed as depressive neurosis or depressive personality disorder, and some developed to a transient paranoid state with excessive drinking. The rate of suicide in alcoholism seems to be lower in Japan than in Western countries: approximately a few percent in a few years in this country and 7 to 8 percent in Western countries. Those cases with prominent self-destructive behavior were young alcoholics. They had underlying personality disorders and complicated life histories.",

Relapse of AE was defined as new onset or worsening of symptoms after an initial improvement or stabilization of at least 2 months. All three patients had a diagnosis of single relapse of AE. There was an average delay of relapse of 1 year (range 0.5–1.5 years). All cases presented with partial features of the typical anti-NMDAR encephalitis (psychiatric manifestations, speech disorder, seizures, orofacial dyskinesias, and decrease of consciousness). The main symptoms of relapses were speech dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, and dyskinesias. Relapses of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis may present over a long period and are usually not very severe at the onset or during the course of the illness. Aggressive immunotherapy at the onset of the illness seems to decrease the risk of relapse.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Multiple Disorders of Sleep and Wakefulness with excessive movement, sleepiness or insomnia are common, affecting most children at some period of life. Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "title": "Questions in psychiatry (<scp>QuiP</scp>): Psychological basis for sexual dysfunction in psychiatry",
      "abstract": "This article is the fifth in our series on sexual wellbeing and its core components. Together, these brief papers aim to provide a foundation of knowledge, which clinicians can draw upon when assessing sexual functioning. The present article is the first to focus on factors that may negatively impact sexual wellbeing and contribute to sexual dysfunction. Specifically, it examines psychosocial factors, which, along with neurophysiological factors, that will be considered separately in a future QuiP, often contribute to sexual problems. We begin by outlining foundational principles regarding the psychological factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction in any individual, and then build on this with further information that pertains specifically to individuals with mental illness. It is important to note that whilst DSM lists a number of formal sexual disorders, these are not common in routine in clinical practice and not easily assessed. Instead, in clinical assessments involving mental health it is far more useful to describe any sexual dysfunction that causes significant distress in terms of the actual symptoms the person is experiencing (e.g., loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty achieving orgasm). In addition, it is critical to bear in mind that sexual experiences are inherently psychological and subject to the attachment of personal meaning. These then guide our expectations of what our sexual experiences should entail. Although we have mentioned the importance of assessing sexual wellbeing previously, it is important to note that sexual dysfunction is surprisingly common. Indeed, it verges on being the norm with an estimated 45% of all couples experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction at some time or another.1 The most common sexual dysfunction reported by females is low sexual desire (33.4%), followed by inhibited orgasm (24.1%), whereas in males the most common problem is premature ejaculation (28.5%) followed by performance anxiety (17%).2 However, it is also very common for most individuals experiencing sexual dysfunction to feel as though they are among a rare minority experiencing such difficulties. This is because even though the topic of sex seems to be ubiquitous, sexual problems or difficulties are seldom discussed, and may not be disclosed even within a medical context. When examining the psychological components that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, the cognitive-behavioural-emotional (CBE) model serves as a useful framework. This is often utilized in cognitive behavioural therapeutic settings to address various kinds of sexual dysfunction. The CBE model posits that psychological components comprise cognitive, behavioural and emotional domains, which when disrupted can contribute to sexual dysfunction (see Figure 1). These domains are further divided into sub-components that interact with one another and when disturbed can contribute to the development and maintenance of sexual dysfunction. Considering cognitive schemas, these play a significant role in sexual wellbeing, and when negative thinking takes hold, it can impair sexual functioning. For example, following a negative sexual experience (e.g., erectile dysfunction, inhibited orgasm, pain), it is possible to develop a 'negative expectancy', which in turn may lead to performance anxiety. If then, in this context, performance is again poor, this reinforces and further entrenches the initial negative cognitions. Other cognitive factors that can play a role include unrealistic standards for sexual experience, which is increasingly common because of widespread exposure to pornography, and 'spectatoring' wherein an individual self-consciously monitors and evaluates their experience rather than focusing on the sensation of the experience itself. Both of these factors can be addressed with psychoeducation. Typically, it is cognitive factors such as these that are amongst the primary factors that have triggered and maintained sexual dysfunction. For example, if a woman has an assumption that women should always orgasm during sex, but this then does not occur on a few occasions in her experiences, she may develop negative attributions regarding the cause, such as 'I am flawed, … something is wrong with me, … something is wrong with my relationship'. This can then lead to feelings of anxiety, frustration, embarrassment, and even shame. In addition, she may develop negative expectancies regarding sex, resulting in avoidance and withdrawal from sexual activities. Thus, a cycle is created and perpetuated, and this can result in what then seems to be a sustained loss of sexual interest, increased anxiety, and depression. The above example demonstrates how sexual dysfunction can be deconstructed into its psychological constituents and traced back to contributing factors, which can then be systematically addressed. The importance of sexual functioning in patients with psychiatric disorders has been discussed previously in this series, and more broadly is recognised as an important domain to assess for overall functioning. Thus, identifying potential psychological factors that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction is important, as it may provide an explanation for the problems the person is experiencing, and perhaps also identify an amenable target for interventions. In addition, as sexual functioning serves as a key indicator of overall functioning, especially in those with mental illnesses where it can serve as an indicator of recovery, addressing any psychological factors that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction is important. It should be noted at this juncture, that sexual dysfunction and the psychological and physiological factors that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, are all interconnected and thus there is a significant degree of overlap and co-occurrence between these components. Hence, our separation is purely pragmatic, and in practice, the two sets of factors should be considered jointly. For example, depression and anxiety often co-occur with physical health conditions such as obesity,4 and any one of a number of individual factors related to these conditions can cause, or be caused by, sexual dysfunction. In reality, a combination of factors is likely to have contributed to these problems and many of these will have a bidirectional causal relationship between sexual dysfunction and mental health. Thus, taking a holistic approach when assessing sexual functioning is critical. When assessing psychological factors that can contribute to sexual dysfunction, it is important to bear in mind that these factors are not necessarily and specifically related to sexual dysfunction per se, but that they can negatively impact functioning more generally. Thus, the psychological factors that need to be assessed during a routine psychiatric assessment remain largely the same. In addition, it is their potential impact on the domain of sexual functioning that needs to be given further consideration. Note, this is alongside their impact on other domains of functioning such as an individual's occupation, and relationships (discussed in previous Quip—'Assessing sexual dysfunction in clinical practice'). To exemplify the bidirectional relationship between sexual functioning and psychological factors, consider the observation that healthy sexual functioning usually alleviates stress, but that sexual dysfunction can also lead to psychological problems. Thus, many mental illnesses are associated with dysfunction across a variety of sexual domains. Further, once stress has produced sexual dysfunction, this can itself lead to further stress exacerbating the problems the individual is already experiencing. Trauma, is another significant psychological factor which is increasingly assessed in routine clinical practice. This encompasses various forms of childhood abuse and neglect (sexual, physical, and emotional) and traumatic events experienced in adulthood (see Figure 2). The impact of trauma on domains of functioning (education, occupation, social) is also often assessed in clinical practice; however, its impact on sexual functioning is seldom explored, if at all. It is therefore important to note that trauma can significantly compromise sexual functioning, regardless of the nature and timing of the trauma. In other words, the trauma does not necessarily have to be sexual in nature or have occurred during a critical developmental period for it to have an effect on sexual functioning in an individual. For example, sexual dysfunction is a known symptom in combat veterans with PTSD,5 and therefore, the contribution of trauma to sexual dysfunction should be considered broadly as possible and explored as a potential target for interventions. As pointed out earlier, mental illnesses impact a number of key psychological domains that can negatively impact sexual functioning. The most common mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, which often co-occur and occur alongside other disorders, entail a number of overlapping symptoms which negatively impact sexual functioning and wellbeing. For example, the symptoms of depression can be captured across 3 domains namely, activity, cognition, and emotion (for further detailed explanation, see The ACE Model*). In the domain of activity, the symptoms of fatigue, increased or decreased sleep and weight/appetite, can all impact sexual functioning due to a lack of energy, or impact self-esteem due to changes in weight that alter self-image and confidence. In the domain of cognition, impaired attention and concentration and psychomotor changes can interfere with sexual functioning by limiting mental engagement and preventing psychological arousal and stimulation. Finally, symptoms within the domain of emotion, such as anhedonia, feelings of guilt or worthlessness and depressed mood can all reduce or eliminate libido, which is essential for healthy sexual functioning. A common bedfellow of depression is anxiety, which when excessive can manifest as a disorder. Several symptoms of anxiety disorders overlap with those of depression, and therefore it is not surprising that anxiety can impair sexual functioning. As mentioned above, difficulties in concentration, disturbances in sleep and fatigue can all diminish sexual desire and the ability to engage in sexual behaviours and practices. Furthermore, generalized anxiety may extend to more specific anxiety regarding sexual functioning and performance, and can also cause erectile dysfunction, and anorgasmia in women. Aside from such specific psychiatric disorders, there are some general symptoms that occur in many mental illnesses and can have a significant impact on sexual functioning, regardless of diagnosis. For example, lowered self-esteem that stems from having a mental illness along with the stigma and shame that this may confer, can significantly threaten the integrity of one's sense of self. Understandably then, this can constrain the individual's ability to engage in sexual behaviours and practices even solo activities—especially if libido is also diminished or lost altogether. In this way, having a mental illness places an additional strain on romantic relationships and interferes with intimacy, all of which makes it difficult to form and sustain relationships. In this brief piece, the psychological factors that can lead to sexual dysfunction in any individual have been outlined, and then building on this, the additional psychological factors that occur within the context of psychiatric disorders have been explored. Importantly, many of these factors are already typically assessed in routine clinical practice, however their impact on sexual function is often overlooked. Furthermore, many of these psychological factors are not necessarily specific to any particular diagnosis, therefore it is important to bear these in mind in all patients. Finally, this relationship is bidirectional, and thus when assessing sexual dysfunction, it is equally important to examine its potential psychological sequelae.

      "abstract": "Introduction Koro syndrome is a culturally related disorder characterized by intense anxiety that the penis (vulva or nipples in females) is shrinking or retracting and will recede into the body. Usually it occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, being extremely rare in western countries. The condition is more common in males and is classified within Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders. Case report A 27-year-old single man was referred to the psychiatric department. By the age of 23, he began worrying that his penis was shrinking and retracting into the abdomen. He described these thoughts as intrusive, ridiculous and repetitive. During the first months the thoughts were not very disturbing but he progressively developed an urge to verify the length of his penis several times a day. To diminish the anxiety provoked by the obsessive doubts on penis length, he started to have repetitive thoughts and mental images about sexual acts, to consume pornography compulsively and to increase his masturbatory behaviors (from some times a week to several times a day). He described those thoughts and behaviors as unpleasant and uniquely driven to reduce anxiety provoked by obsessions. He was prescribed fluvoxamine 200 mg/day and initiated cognitive behavioral therapy with good response. Y-BOCS score decreased from 30 at initial evaluation to 18 after 3 months of treatment. Conclusions Koro syndrome is a very rare condition in psychiatry in western countries, usually presenting secondarily to other psychiatric disorders. Awareness of this diagnosis and knowledge on its management are critical to provide optimal care to patients.

      "abstract": "Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) refers to a complex of cyclical and recurrent physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms that occur specifically in luteal phase and remain for minimum three consecutive menstrual cycles. Up to 80% of women of child bearing age report with few mild symptoms of PMS prior to menstruation. But clinically significant PMS is seen only in 3 to 8% of women. Its more severe form, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) has listed one among the Depressive mental disorders by American Psychiatric Association. Premenstrual Syndrome, an often neglecting medical condition due to social taboo of not discussing the issue of menstruation, was not considered as a disease earlier due to unawareness of the grave symptoms of the disease. Till now, the disease is a medical mystery with unknown cause and without any specific proved diagnosis and medication in modern medicine. This article is merely an attempt to relate PMS with Pittavritta Vyana Vata, which is an Avaranajanya Vyadhi. In Rituvyateetakala which is compared mainly with the luteal phase, there is Pittakopavastha and Vatasanchayavastha. With excess intake of Pittakar Nidan in Rituvyateetakala, Sanchita Vata specifically Vyana Vayu gets Avritta with Kupita Pitta and manifested in the form of Sarvanga Daha, Santapa, Klama etc. So the disease PMS can be managed and treated on the line of Pittavritta Vyana Vayu so as to provide relief from its deleterious effects and improve her family and social life.",

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

Em pacientes sem histórico de epilepsia, o Estado Epiléptico Mioclônico raramente foi relatado como relatos de casos únicos, que estavam principalmente relacionados ao medicamento. Entre 2017 e 2023, três pacientes do sexo masculino e um do sexo feminino, três com anóxia prévia e um com epilepsia prévia foram internados e tratados. A idade variou entre 39 e 84 anos. Com o tratamento com fenitoína, três pacientes pioraram ou iniciaram Estado Epiléptico Mioclônico. O agravamento da epilepsia generalizada idiopática ou a precipitação do Estado Epiléptico Mioclônico foram bem documentados na Epilepsia Generalizada. Portanto, apenas um paciente desses casos tinha Epilepsia Mioclônica Juvenil. Os pacientes melhoraram ou controlaram as convulsões e a mioclonia com a retirada da fenitoína.

      "abstract": "Abstract At least one-third of all patients referring themselves to a general practitioner or presenting to a general medical clinic have no evidence of underlying organic disease to account for their symptoms. They do not have frank psychiatric illness, and are conventionally considered to have functional disorders. The term ‘functional disorder’ is, unfortunately, sometimes used in a pejorative or dismissive manner, as biomedical science has become the focus of medical attention. Altered emotional states are commonly associated with physical symptoms, and most people will have experienced (say) urinary frequency before an interview or an examination. Some individuals do not find it easy to admit to, much less to express, the emotions which are disturbing them; others lack the insight and emotional vocabulary which would help them to associate their physical symptoms with an emotional problem. As Balint [124] has said, some illnesses allow patients to complain of a problem.",

      "title": "The stages of recovery from severe head injury with special reference to late outcome",
      "abstract": "Ten years research into the physical and psychosocial consequences of severe brain damage in adults has revealed substantial information about the process of recovery. The main features are evidence that the greater part of physical and mental recovery occurs within six months of injury and that in most cases the mental consequences of injury outweigh the physical ones and place the greater burden upon the injured person's relatives. Impairment of memory is the most common cognitive disorder and alterations in personality often occur also and are the most taxing of the mental deficits for all concerned. The process of recovery has three stages, in the first the patient is unconscious, in the second he or she regains full consciousness signified by the end of the period of post traumatic amnesia and continues to show evidence of rapid improvement in basic physical and mental functions. The rate of recovery shows within six months of injury in most cases and this represents the end of the second stage. In the third stage, which may last for many months, both the patient and his or her relatives adapt to the residual disabilities of the former. Methods of managing the three stages should include physical, psychological and social techniques and the way in which they may be linked to the patients' differing physical and psychosocial needs during the three stages of recovery are briefly discussed.",

      "title": "Venlafaxina en el tratamiento de la fobia social",
      "abstract": "RET, Revista de Toxicomanias. No. 13 – 1997 La fobia social, uno de los trastornos de ansiedad definidos en el DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association [APA] 1994); es comun entre la poblacion general. El trastorno se caracteriza por el miedo a hacer alguna cosa o actuar de manera que pueda resultar embarazosa o a ser juzgado o evaluado por los demas. Entre las situaciones fobicas comunes se incluye hablar en publico, comer frente a otros, firmar, ser presentado a extranos o utilizar urinarios publicos. Los episodios de ansiedad pueden ser similares a las crisis de angustia, y muchos de los sujetos evitan las situaciones que les generan ansiedad. Los datos de prevalencia de la fobia social sugieren una prevalencia a lo largo de la vida desde el 3 5% (Schneier y col. 1992b) hasta el 11-15% (Kessler y col. 1994). Estos datos muestran que la fobia social compite en frecuencia con los problemas mas comunmente tratados en el entorno psiquiatrico. El pico de edad de inicio se situa en la adolescencia y primera juventud. Las personas con fobia social se ven afectadas significativamente por varios factores familiares, sociales y ocupacionales particularmente a esa edad, pero tambien a lo largo de la vida adulta. La fobia social (Schneier y col. 1992b) puede ir asociada a comorbilidad significativa, como un aumento de la depresion o el consumo de alcohol o drogas y una disminucion de la calidad de vida. La fobia social responde a varios tratamientos farmacologicos, incluyendo los inhibidores de la monoamino oxidasa (IMAOs) (Liebowitz y col. 1986; Versiani y col. 1992), las benzodiacepinas (Davidson y col. 1991; Ontiveros y Fontaine 1990), y los ISRSs (Black y col. 1992; Schneier y col. 1992b, Sternbach 1990), asi como a la terapia cognitivo-conductual (Marks 1985). De los tratamientos farmacologicos, los IMAOs fenelzina y moclobemida son los que mas se han estudiado (Liebowith y col. 1986; Versiani y col. 1992). Los IMAOs bloquean la degradacion de todas las monoaminas pero requieren restricciones en la dieta que algunos pacientes consideran dificiles de seguir o que les asustan. Todas estas medicaciones interactuan con los sistemas serotoninergico, dopaminergico, noradrenergico o del acido gamma-amino-butirico. Existe una interaccion significativa entre estos sistemas y actualmente no esta claro cuales estan involucrados en la fobia social. En muchos aspectos, el perfil mixto de recaptacion de la venlafaxina parece ofrecer varias de las ventajas teraVenlafaxina en el tratamiento de la fobia social",

      "abstract": "This article reviews what causes clinicians to overlook or underdiagnose akathisia. The causes are considered to be related to both the patient's symptoms and the clinician's attitude toward akathisia. The patient factors include mild severity of akathisia, lack of apparent motor restlessness, no voluntary expression of inner restlessness, no clear communication of inner restlessness, restlessness in body parts other than the legs, atypical expressions of inner restlessness, other prominent psychic symptoms, and absence of other extrapyramidal signs. The clinician factors include emphasis on objective restlessness, failure to consider akathisia during antipsychotic therapy, failure to fully implement antiakathisia treatments in ambiguous cases, and strict adherence to research diagnostic criteria. Akathisia is likely to be overlooked or underdiagnosed when both patient and clinician factors are present. Currently, there may be two major problems with underdiagnosis: (1) symptoms that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for akathisia are overlooked, and (2) conditions that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria but can still benefit from antiakathisia measures are underdiagnosed.",

There was no breed or age predisposition but females were preferentially affected (70%). The rate of onset of signs was variable from a week to greater than 1 month. Quadriparesis was present to varying severities and in two dogs the head and neck could not be supported. Mastication, swallowing, respiration and bladder function were unimpaired. Pain sensation was normal, tone was usually decreased and the local limb reflexes depressed or absent. Muscle atrophy was often prominent. All cases bar one recovered but another dog was also destroyed. Electrophysiology revealed diffuse spontaneous activity in the muscles and the motor nerve conduction velocities were at the lower end of or just below the normal range. The evoked muscle potentials were reduced in amplitude. Sensory nerve potentials were normal. The pathology showed a degeneration of the distal intramuscular axons with collateral axonal sprouting. The muscle changes were typical of neurogenic atrophy. The disease has been called distal denervating disease (DDD) until the precise aetiology can be determined.",

Peripheral 7ieuritis.The motor disturbance generally indicates the involvement of a definite nerve-distribution ; certain muscles, however, may remain wholly or relatively unaffected, yet usually the involvement of one or more distinct nerves may be determined.Functional im¬ pairment usually precedes atrophy, though not always ; both may go hand in hand.Disturbances of sensibility are generally in the distribution of the affected nerve, or confined to a portion of the same ; sensibility may be normal, however, while disease of the muscles persists.Electrical examination may give very variable results, the different muscles also varying between themselves in electrical reaction; complete or partial \"degeneration reaction\" is the rule, however, when the disease is at its height.3. Progres¬ sive muscular atrophy.The muscular affection may be more or less diffuse in its distribution, or, in some cases, entirely irregular, while in others it may be confined to definite nerve-tracts.It begins usu¬ ally in the small muscles of the hands, exhibiting a complete paral¬ lelism between the development of the atrophy and the paresis.Sensibility remains unaffected.Usually partial, and occasionally complete, degeneration reaction can, at times, with difficulty be demonstrated, and in the latter stages reaction may disappear entirely.Fibrillary contractions are very frequent.4.

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

There is evidence that seizures cause brain injury, including neuronal death and physiological dysfunction. Mortality rates are 4—7 times higher in people with medically refractory seizures, and injury rates are substantial, ranging from one per 20 person-years to as much as one per 3 person-years. Quality of life is impaired in epilepsy, and relates to seizure control. Psychosocial disabilities, including lower social interaction with reduced marriage rates and reduced employment levels, are more common in people with refractory seizures. Complete seizure control is desirable, since seizures potentially constitute a serious threat to health and well-being. Therefore, satisfactory seizure control should be defined as having no seizures. Treatment should be directed to preventing seizures whenever possible and achieving control early in the course of illness. The risks of uncontrolled seizures outweigh the risks of aggressive medical or surgical therapy.",

A avaliação psiquiátrica revelou que apenas dois entre 65 pacientes tinham quadro de depressão. Na maior parte dos casos, eram traços ou transtornos de personalidade que pareciam explicar a dor e/ou sua perpetuação. Traços e transtornos de personalidade têm servido como variável de confusão no debate etiológico entre a depressão e a dor crônica.

Head nodding may be normal, but it is usually seen in children who have emotional issues or are mentally retarded or who have spasmusnutans. Note the amount, color, and texture of the hair. The newborn infant usually has hair that is fully replaced beginning at about 3 months of age, though substantial new hair growth may not be observed until 9 – 24 months. Lack of hair (alopecia) may be a familial characteristic or a manifestation of ectodermal dysplasia, hyperthyroidism, or progeria. Localized alopecia (alopecia areata) is seen in ringworm or other infections of the scalp and in acrodynia, but in infants it is most commonly caused by rubbing of localized areas when the infant lies in one position for a long time. Rarely, alopecia areata is seen in children with syphilis or hypervitaminosis A or in children who pull out the hair or occurs after severe systemic disease (e.g., typhoid fever).",

      "abstract": "Antipsychotic agents differ in efficacy and side effects such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation because of varying mechanisms of action. A revised nomenclature for antipsychotic agents, which categorizes the drugs according to efficacy, risk of movement disorders, and risk of prolactin elevation, is described. Prolactin elevation, a potential side effect of some antipsychotic medications, is underdiagnosed but can have serious short-term and long-term consequences. Short-term problems include menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and depression. Long-term problems related to prolactin elevation include decreased bone density and osteoporosis, relapse of psychosis because of poor compliance due to sexual dysfunction or depression, and perhaps cancer, although more research in this area is needed. Despite the serious nature of these effects, prolactin elevation is seldom detected because clinicians often fail to inquire about sexual function or other symptoms that signal that a patient's prolactin may be elevated. These are problems that patients may not bring up with clinicians unless they are asked. Therefore, when patients are taking antipsychotic medications, clinicians should regularly inquire about sexual dysfunction, depression, menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and gynecomastia.",

PSSD mainly consists of hypo-anesthesia of the genital area, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction. Although different management options have been proposed, there is no consensus on the treatment for this syndrome. Herein we report on a young man affected by PSSD who regained sexual functioning after 3-month treatment with EDOVIS, a dietary supplement containing L-citrulline and other commonly used aphrodisiacs. Clinicians should be aware about the possibility of persistent sexual side effects induced by serotoninergic antidepressants and take into considerations the use of nutraceuticals to overcome PSSD.",

Patients have to be back at their baseline functional level once the disorder has resolved. This is a heterogeneous group of patients who have either a disorder similar to schizophrenia or something closer to a mood disorder. Objectives To analyze clinical, psychopathological and epidemiological characteristics of schizophreniform disorder and also review causes, incidence, prevalence, diagnostic, therapeutic tools and the importance of maintaining the treatment, because of the abandonment of the treatment, which is a predictor of relapses. Methods A review of the main impact literature concerning schizophreniform disorder is done during the last five years: prevalence, incidence, pathogenesis and its relationship with other psychiatric disorders encoded in DSM-V are studied. Results The etiology is unknown. Psychotic symptoms can be treated with antipsychotics for 3 to 6 months. They usually respond faster than patients with schizophrenia (75% vs 20% respond within 8 days). Conclusions The disease has a favorable prognosis, and has similarities with mood disorders. However, some data suggest a close relationship to schizophrenia. In support of the relationship with mood disorders, patients have more affective symptoms and a better outcome than patients with schizophrenia. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is generally defined as pain in the pelvic area that persisted for 3–6 months or longer. The pain can be constant or episodic and functionally disabling. Any dysfunction of the central nervous system can lead to central sensitization, which enhances and maintains pain as well as other symptoms that are mediated by the central nervous system. It occurs in subgroups of nearly every chronic pain condition and is characterized by multifocal pain and co-occurring somatic symptoms. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is defined as a condition in which having one or more somatic symptoms, such as excessive worries, pressure, and catastrophic events. These symptoms can be very disruptive to a patient’s life and can cause significant distress. SSD cases with severe symptoms frequently undergo repeated medical investigations and the symptoms often lead patients to seek emergency medical treatment and consult with specialists repeatedly, which is a source of frustration for patients and clinicians. Here we report a case that Asian female with persistent CPPS with comorbid SSD, who got in trouble for up to 8 years. This case reminds clinicians to pay excessive attention to the diagnosis of CPPS with comorbid SSD after recovery from acute COVID-19, with hope of raising awareness in the identification of SSD and present new insight into appropriate treatment for each woman who suffers from it.",

      "abstract": "Both depression and conduct disorders are relatively prevalent and are related to poor long-term outcomes. Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

It only involves some peculiar sensori-motor symptoms that occur for a short period of the day and do not even occur every day. So why bother treating the disorder? The clinically significant morbidity of RLS involves its disruption of quality of life (QoL) more than any of its specific symptom features. RLS patients complain of sleep disruption (1) and sensory problems involving pain and discomfort (2). They may have some possible cognitive impairments (3). The first two of these clinical features, however, represent the large majority of patient complaints. In a large survey of the general population in the United States, those with moderate to severe RLS symptoms reported two types of major complaints: discomfort and pain for 88% and sleep disturbance for 76% (4). But such complaints, even when dramatic, may not be clinically significant. What indication do we have that these symptoms reported by RLS patients adversely affect normal living, thereby justifying considerable treatment efforts? Health-related QoL studies address this critical question of the clinical significance of disease-related complaints. RLS is not known to shorten life but does it significantly disrupt life? The answer for this question comes best from the QoL evaluations.",

      "abstract": "The importance of the field of geropsychology (psychology of aging) is seen in the ever-increasing demographics of older adults. A psychologist needs to understand the various life stages that define different cohorts of older adults. Older adults are affected by the forces of stigma and ageism, which are of four types: personal, institutional, intentional, and unintentional. A majority of older adults experience age discrimination and stigmatization after the age of 65. The use of medical model of psychopathology causes contradictions and distortions, one of which is the use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Assessment of deficits in olfactory functioning are potentially useful for a psychologist who is attempting to differentiate between cognitive disturbances of normal aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sexual interest remains high throughout old adult developmental stages, but sexual activity declines in most men as they age. While older adults are more likely to avoid illicit substances, many older adults having chronic pain from cancer or arthritis need opioid medications. Older adult abuse is a multifactorial phenomenon as the abuse may be emotional, financial, physical, sexual, or self-induced. Environmental geropsychology is based on Lewin's field theory model Lawton and Nahemow's ecological model, and an environmental geropsychologist focuses on the environmental component to develop interventions to change older adults' interpersonal and intrapersonal experiences. Heightened awareness of coming of death results in an existential crisis for many older adults causing a loss of their sense of purpose for their lives.",

PMDD is distinguished from PMS by the severity of symptoms, predominance of mood symptoms, and role dysfunction, particularly in personal relationships and marital/family domains. Several treatment modalities are beneficial in PMDD and severe PMS, but the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have emerged as first-line therapy. The SSRIs can be administered continuously throughout the entire month, intermittently from ovulation to the onset of menstruation, or semi-intermittently with dosage increases during the late luteal phase. These guidelines present practical treatment algorithms for the use of SSRIs in women with pure PMDD or severe PMS, PMDD and underlying subsyndromal clinical features of mood or anxiety, or premenstrual exacerbation of a mood/anxiety disorder.",

DISORDERS OF MOTILITY It is well known that all extrapyramidal diseases have this factor in common—they all present characteristic disturbances of motility associated with changes in muscle tonus . These disorders of motility can be definitely differentiated from the pyramidal tract, and three forms can be distinguished, all of which are manifested in the course of voluntary, automatic and reflex movements. These three forms are: (1) hypokinesia; (2) diminished or increased muscletone states, manifesting themselves in either hypotonia or hypertonic rigidity: (3) hyperkinesia. 1. The hypokinesiae consist of failure of innervation during voluntary movements (mild paralysis), consisting of",

      "abstract": "The negative symptoms of schizophrenia comprise a range of deficits in communication, emotional responsiveness, socialisation, capacity for experiencing pleasure, and motivation. Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

      "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common chronic health conditions and mental disorders affecting school-aged children. Prevalence with a conservative estimate is reported to be 3–5% of this population. Boys are approximately three-times more likely to be diagnosed than girls. The diagnosis refers to a family of related chronic neurobiological disorders that interfere with an individual's capacity to regulate activity level, inhibit behavior and attend to tasks in developmentally appropriate ways. Signs and symptoms of ADHD are typically present during the preschool period or in the early elementary school years, and the diagnosis requires that difficulties were present at or before age 7 years and create problems or impairment in at least two areas of the child's life (e.g., at school, on the playground, on the bus, at home or socially with peers). Stimulants are the first-line medication in the psychopharmacological treatment of ADHD. Between 10 and 30% of those affected with ADHD may not respond to stimulants or may not be able to tolerate associated side effects, such as appetite suppression, sleep disturbance, mood difficulties or exacerbation of comorbid tic disorders. In such instances, or when families are unwilling to consider a stimulant, nonstimulant medications may be appealing. Several nonstimulant medications that affect noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic pathways have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ADHD, although effect sizes are comparable with methylphenidate, fewer data have accumulated regarding the safety profile of nonstimulants in general. This review focuses on etiology, assessment and treatment of ADHD, in particular alternative treatment approaches with various nonstimulant agents, especially atomoxetine.",

Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

What follows is a description of the pathophysiological mechanisms of these conditions, their most salient cognitive manifestations during adulthood and old age, assessment issues which may arise in neuropsychological evaluation of individuals with these disorders, and a review of the effects of treatment of these conditions on cognitive function.",

The incidence of seizures in AD and predictors of which patients with AD might be more predisposed to them is based primarily on retrospective studies and is not well established. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine the incidence and predictors of new-onset unprovoked seizures. <h3>Design</h3> Prospective cohort study. <h3>Setting</h3> Three academic centers. <h3>Patients</h3> Four hundred fifty-three patients with probable AD observed prospectively from mild disease stages since 1992. <h3>Main Outcome Measure</h3> Informant interviews every 6 months included questions about whether the patient had a seizure (convulsion, fainting, or “funny” spell) and whether diagnosis or treatment for epilepsy or seizure was made. Two epileptologists independently retrospectively reviewed all available medical records for 52 patients with positive responses to either of these questions, and using a specific checklist form, events were diagnosed as to whether they were unprovoked seizures (intrarater concordance, κ = 0.67). Diagnosis of unprovoked seizures constituted the event in survival analyses. Potential predictors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational achievement, duration of illness, baseline cognition and function, depression, medical comorbidities, and time-dependent use of cholinesterase inhibitors and neuroleptic agents, apolipoprotein E genotype, and previous electroencephalographic findings. <h3>Results</h3> Over the course of 3518 visit-assessments (per patient: mean, 7.8; maximum, 27), 7 patients (1.5%) developed seizures. Younger age was associated with higher risk (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.41;<i>P</i> = .003 for each additional year of age) of seizure incidence. No other predictor was significant. The overall incidence of seizures was low (418 per 100 000 person-years of observation) although significantly higher than expected for idiopathic unprovoked seizures in similar age ranges of the general population (hazard ratio, 8.06; 95% confidence interval, 3.23-16.61). <h3>Conclusions</h3> Unprovoked seizures are uncommon in AD, but they do occur more frequently than in the general population. Younger age is a risk factor for seizures in AD.",

The types of psychological reactions an obstetrician should be aware of are: 1) psychosomatic factors causing infertility; 2) normal emotional reactions to pregnancy; 3) emotion-caused diseases in pregnancy, such as excessive vomoting; 4) psychiatric symptoms that seem to develop in pregnancies characterized by severe anemia, toxemia, and infections; 5) neurotic symptoms, which most often appear in a first pregnancy, when the woman is still immature; 6) psychological preparation for painless childbirth; and 7) emotional reactions to legal abortion and sterilization. Cases of functional psychosis should be referred to a psychiatrist.",

      "title": "Tackling anxiety and depression in older people in primary care.",
      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that anxiety and depression are less common in older than younger adults. One in ten people aged > or = 65 fulfils the diagnostic criteria for at least one common mental disorder. Older depressed patients have an increased risk of both cardiac and all-cause mortality. Both anxiety and depression in older patients are often unrecognised and untreated, and have a poor prognosis. There is a progressive decline in the prevalence of common mental disorders above the age of 55. Anxiety and depression often occur together, and share many risk factors. However, anxiety tends to follow threats or traumatic events, whereas depression follows loss events. Chronic diseases, cognitive impairment, pain and functional disability are risk factors for the onset of depression, but not anxiety. Depression is between two and three times more common among those with a chronic physical health problem. Even patients with major depression often remain unrecognised and untreated. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is by far the most common anxiety disorder in older people but most GAD patients are not recognised in primary care and only a third of them receive any form of treatment. Older patients often deny feeling anxious or depressed and are more likely to present with insomnia, irritability, agitation and multiple somatic complaints. GPs may erroneously believe that depression is a normal reaction to the losses of old age, and may be reluctant to initiate treatment. A good case can be made for replacing the PHQ-9 with the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale which almost entirely avoids somatic questions. This is a screening not a diagnostic tool and does not evaluate symptom severity.",

One possible explanation for this underrepresentation is that men frequently conceal or obscure their emotional difficulties as a consequence of masculine gender role socialization. Men who subscribe to traditional, Western masculine values may be inclined to hide, minimize, or otherwise have difficulty expressing their psychological suffering, rendering this suffering difficult for clinicians to observe, diagnose, and treat. This manuscript describes an approach to the assessment process with men that integrates clinical reports on assessment and psychotherapy with men, values pertaining to our culture's construction of traditional masculinity, and empirical findings on psychological disorders more commonly observed in men.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the most common of disabling neurological conditions, and seizures are among the most common of neurological symptoms. Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "title": "Provoked and reflex seizures: Surprising or common?",
      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

      "abstract": "Aims Moral Injury is a strong cognitive and emotional response occurring upon witnessing, participating in, or failing to prevent an act that goes against one's ethical code. This has been linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Suicidality, and Anxiety, amongst others. Data on its association with Schizophrenia are however lacking. Trance and Possession Disorders defined by the ICD-10 refers to a group of disorders involving temporary loss of both the sense of personal identity and full awareness of the surrounding with individuals acting in some cases as if taken over by another personality, spirit, deity, or force with reports of such states occurring in primary psychotic disorder. This case presentation describes a 22-year-old male whose first episode of schizophrenia was preceded by moral injury Methods A 22-year-old male Nigerian with a strong conservative Christian religious upbringing and a history of receiving a prophecy against having intercourse with women. He started showing symptoms of a mental illness a month after attaining coitarche with a lady. This presentation was characterized by irrelevant speech, intrusive flashbacks and unusual beliefs (excessive guilt, ill health). 7 months after, he was presented to the hospital with above symptoms and disorganized behavior characterized by beliefs of being possessed by four different people, shouting in different voice textures, throwing himself on the floor. We kept in view a diagnosis of schizophrenia and placed him on oral Olanzapine 5mg nocte following which he made significant improvement within 2 weeks with no memory of the event. Results Different factors can be considered in the aetiopathogenesis and presentation of symptoms in this patient. According to Williamson V. et. al; An Individual's experience of moral injury may lead to feelings of shame or guilt which was present in this patient (delusion of guilt). The pathogenic effect of culture and religion(e.g through prophecy against intercourse with women) may account for this illness. Moreso, pathoplastic and pathoreactive effects of culture could be said to have contributed significantly to the presentation of a psychotic disorder with trance and possession state as a reaction to moral injury. Conclusion Moral Injury, not previously considered to be associated with primary psychotic disorder may not only possibly precipitate a primary psychotic disorder but also show cultural/religious differences in phenomenology. Further studies are therefore required to explore these associations.",

      "title": "From Onset and Prodromal Stage to a Life-Long Course of Schizophrenia and Its Symptom Dimensions: How Sex, Age, and Other Risk Factors Influence Incidence and Course of Illness",
      "abstract": "The core symptoms of psychosis-delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorders-are not unique to the disorder traditionally called schizophrenia. They occur at the early stages of various brain diseases, too. Psychosis seems to be a preformed pattern of response of the human brain. Most schizophrenia onsets are marked by a prodromal stage extending over several years and producing the maximum of social consequences. Schizophrenia incidence shows a steep increase culminating at age 15 to 25 years in males. In females it reaches a first peak at age 15 to 30 years and a second, flatter peak at menopausal age (44-49 years). Thereafter, incidence declines to a plateau at later ages. Unlike what the findings of most large-scale epidemiological studies applying an upper age limit of 45 to 55 years suggest, schizophrenia is a disorder of all ages. The lifetime risk seems to be the same for both sexes. The lower incidence in premenopausal women is accounted for by the downregulating effect of oestrogen on dopamine receptors. This hormonal protective effect is antagonised by the genetic effect of a high familial load. In the long-term illness course, right-censored to 11.2 years following first admission, the number of psychotic relapse episodes ranges from 0 to 29 with a mean of 3. The positive symptom dimension produces the highest number of relapses and the shortest duration of exacerbations with a mean length of two months. The depressive and negative symptom dimensions show exacerbations extending over nearly six months on average. Following the first illness episode symptom scores decline sharply, reaching a plateau five years after first admission. Negative symptoms come to a plateau after 2 to 3 years in females and after 5 years in males. Depression is the most frequent type of symptom in the long-term course. In the light of these results urgent treatment issues will be discussed.",

Comorbid affective or substance abuse disorders did not predict psychotic symptoms.Psychotic episodes are common but not universal among patients with borderline personality disorder, regardless of whether a concurrent axis I disorder is present. Those episodes are not necessarily brief or transient, and borderline patients who experience psychotic episodes are likely to have repeated hospitalizations.",

      "abstract": "Im Anschluss an einen zahlenmaessigen Ueberblick ueber das Vorkommen der Alzheimer-Erkrankung in den Altersgruppen ab 65 Jahren in Deutschland werden die Auswirkungen der Alzheimer-Demenz (AD) auf die Fahrtauglichkeit diskutiert. Die Beeintraechtigungen der AD werden in die Auspraegungsgrade leicht, mittel und schwer unterschieden, denen eine Praedemenzphase von etwa fuenf bis sieben Jahren mit leichten, teils schwer erfassbaren kognitiven Beeintraechtigungen vorausgeht. Die Symptome bei fortschreitender Erkrankung werden im Einzelnen beschrieben. Bei mittleren und schweren Auspraegungsgraden sind die Betroffenen nicht mehr in der Lage, ein Fahrzeug sicher zu fuehren. In der Praedemenzphase und im Fruehstadium ist es fraglich, inwieweit und wie lange die Fahrfaehigkeit ohne erhoehtes Risiko erhalten bleibt. Der individuelle Krankheitsverlauf fuehrt dazu, dass die Fahreignung unterschiedlich lange erhalten bleibt. Nicht alleine die Leistungsdefizite sind entscheidend, sondern die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation und deren Aufrechterhaltung. Im Abschnitt ueber Rechtsvorschriften und Richtlinien werden die Begutachtungs-Leitlinien zur Kraftfahrereignung zitiert. Danach ist derjenige nicht in der Lage, ein Kraftfahrzeug zu fuehren, der unter einer ausgepraegten Demenz leidet. Dabei ist der Nachweis fuer ausgepraegte Leistungsmaengel unklar, da nicht sichergestellt ist, ob und wie lange Defizite kompensiert werden koennen. Die Leistungsueberpruefungen mittels neuropsychologischer Testungen korrelieren bei aelteren Menschen nur gering mit den Ergebnissen des praktischen Fahrverhaltens. In kritischen Faellen ist eine Fahrverhaltensprobe anzuraten, in der die Faehigkeit zur Kompensation erfasst wird, die entscheidend zur Erhaltung der Fahrfaehigkeit ist. Abschliessend wird ueber den derzeitigen Forschungsstand zur Fahreignung bei Patienten mit AD berichtet. Beitrag zum 3.

      "abstract": "Two situations, which may of course interfere, are described in the field of psychological and psychiatric emergencies in child and adolescent: 1) therapeutic emergencies, true emergencies, linked to acute mental suffering or even distress in the child which it is important to relieve quickly. They are not always the object of an acute request for medical care, and when such a request is made, it is rarely based on what the child feels, but much more on noisy or troublesome behaviour or somatic manifestations of the latter, this last possibility producing a masked psychiatric emergency very characteristic of this age; 2) environmental emergencies represent a second form of emergency, defined by a situation which appears when the child's family or tutors suddenly decide that they can no longer face such a behaviour or such symptoms in the child. Intolerance then appears, or even rejection of the child from his home. The authors were led to determine this double dimension, concentrating their attention on the first few years of life, childhood from 4 to 5 years to 11 or 12 years and adolescence. Insisting on the dual necessity, even in emergency cases, of sufficient reflexion and necessary concentration of interest on problems as they are presented by the family, the authors describe the various stages of an emergency: entering into contact, evaluation of the situation, choice of the emergency procedure: gaining time or admission to hospital in a specialized unit. They end by taking into consideration the fact that one is never sufficiently attentive to the child himself and to his own way of dealing with the situation.",

      "title": "Hypersexual Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—Inappropriate and excessive sexual behaviors have been described in dementias, and can be a manifestation of disinhibition, depression, psychosis, or agitation due to medications, pain, and medical illness. Very little has appeared in the literature regarding treatment. Neuroleptics are the mainstay of treatment but are not always effective. One case associated with aggressive behaviors responded to Trazodone, thought to be due to its tranquilizing properties.1 Four others were successfully treated with a one-year course of medroxyprogesterone acetate, which mainly acts to lower testosterone production.2 Beta-blockers like Propranolol3 and Pindolol4 have been well studied in the treatment of aggressive behavior associated with organic brain disease. Reasoning that sexual behavior can be a form of aggression, we treated a man suffering from Alzheimer's disease and excessive sexual behaviors with Pindolol. Mr G is a 75-year-old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease requiring bypass surgery at the age of 68. Dementia gradually developed after that time, and he received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 71 after a thorough medical evaluation. His wife cared for him at home until the age of 75, when his behavior deteriorated such that he was rejected by an adult day care center. He was hospitalized twice, at which time agitated, hypersexual behaviors were noted (verbal comments, hugging, kissing, self-exposure, and attempted fondling). He was discharged to a nursing home but was soon sent back to the hospital due to their intolerance of these same behaviors, which were unresponsive to Haloperidol 1 – 3 mg daily. The Haloperidol seemed to cause extrapyramidal lip smacking and pelvic undulation, although these might also have represented sexual behaviors. He occasionally struck out physically against other people. Upon admission Mr G was severely demented and tangential in his thinking with auditory and visual hallucinations and visual spatial distortions. He was generally agitated, with frequent episodes of inappropriate sexual behavior such as that at the nursing home, and was minimally able to follow one-step commands. Physical examination and laboratory studies were benign except for some residual extrapyramidal movements. Vegetative functions were not impaired. He was observed for five days using only Hydroxyzine 50 mg TID on a prn basis to lessen agitation, which responded briefly to each dose. Then, Pindolol 5 mg each morning was started, and was gradually increased to 20 mg twice daily over a two-week period with no adverse side effects. By the second day on Pindolol the agitation and hypersexual behaviors had diminished, the latter basically disappearing by week two. Mr G's baseline presentation was now calm with bursts of agitation one to three times daily, treated with Hydroxyzine 50 mg (one to two doses daily). Hallucinations continued to be prominent and were considered to be a major contributor to the episodic agitation, so Haloperidol 1 mg thrice daily was started. This resulted in rapid improvement in the remaining agitation without side effects (at least in the short term). No further Hydroxyzine was needed. It could be argued that time in the hospital eliminated Mr G's agitation, but this had not been the case during prior admissions or at the nursing home. Other medications like Trazodone, Medroxyprogesterone, or higher dose Haloperidol might have been as effective as our regimen. In summary, the author presents a case of dementia with severely fragmented thinking and hallucinations associated with marked hypersexual agitation. The sexual agitation was viewed as a subtype of organic personality syndrome with disinhibition of aggressive behaviors. Pindolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker with rapid onset of action and limited side effects, eliminated the hypersexual behaviors in the short term. Haloperidol was successfully used to limit agitation due to hallucinations and perceptual distortions. Based on this case, beta-blockers appear to be an option in treating hypersexual agitation in demented and perhaps other organically impaired patients.",

UI is well known as a clinical triad for the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). However, other than UI, NPH patients commonly have urinary urgency/frequency (overactive bladder: OAB), and less commonly, voiding difficulty. Fourteen percent of the patients (either women or men) have post-void residual > 100 ml. The most common urodynamic abnormality is detrusor overactivity (DO), which was noted in 95% of patients. The underlying pathophysiology for OAB/DO in patients with NPH seems to be decreased cerebral blood flow in the right frontal cortex, and to a lesser extent, altered basal ganglia function. Functional UI can overlap the OAB/DO due secondary to impaired cognition/initiative, immobility, or disturbed consciousness in this disorder.",

This overview of the literature shows that individuals who suffer abuse, neglect, or serious family dysfunction as children are more likely to be depressed, to experience other types of psychiatric illness, to have more physical symptoms (both medically explained and unexplained), and to engage in more health-risk behaviors than their nonabused counterparts. The more severe the abuse, the stronger the association with poor outcomes in adulthood. Childhood sexual abuse in particular has been repeatedly associated, in adulthood, with physical complaints such as chronic pain that are likewise associated with depression. Individuals with a history of childhood abuse, particularly sexual abuse, are more likely than individuals with no history of abuse to become high utilizers of medical care and emergency services. Childhood maltreatment is highly prevalent among both men and women, especially in specialty settings such as emergency psychiatric care.",

Negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are attributed to stigma. In the literature, stigma is regarded as something that is attached to a person ‐ like a badge or label. This is undermined by two facts. Firstly, it is the person who is regarded as disgraceful, not the illness or diagnosis, and secondly, the diagnosis of mental illness is itself evaluative. Mental illness is by definition bad, so to be diagnosed as mentally ill is to be defined as bad (or somehow wrong). The stigmatisation of the mentally ill will not stop until this negative evaluation is removed from diagnosis.",

Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

      "title": "First oral treatment zuranolone’s FDA approval and its impact on postpartum depression: a new hope – a correspondence",
      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a type of mood disorder that affects some individuals after they give birth. It is characterized by a range of emotional and physical symptoms that can significantly impact a new parent's well-being, their ability to care for their baby, and their overall quality of life. PPD typically occurs within the first few weeks or months after childbirth, but it can develop anytime during the first year. New parents with PPD often experience intense feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness. Irritability, mood swings, and excessive crying are also common. PPD can manifest with physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite (either overeating or loss of appetite), and disruptions in sleep patterns (difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much). Individuals with PPD might have trouble concentrating, making decisions, or focusing on tasks1. PPD affects a significant number of new parents in the United States. It is estimated that around one in seven women (or about 14–20%) experience PPD after giving birth. Women who have previously experienced PPD are at a higher risk of experiencing it again with subsequent pregnancies. The recurrence rate for PPD is estimated to be around 30–50%. Many cases of PPD go undiagnosed and untreated. Only about 15% of individuals with PPD receive professional help2. In 2017, a research study revealed that suicide constituted ~5% of perinatal fatalities among Canadian women, predominantly happening within the initial 3 months following childbirth due to PPD3. Current treatment of PPD includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like sertraline and fluoxetine are commonly prescribed for PPD (Table 1). Table 1 - Pharmacological treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and escitalopram (Lexapro) are often considered first-line treatments for postpartum depression (PPD). They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) SNRIs like venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) also affect serotonin levels, but they additionally impact norepinephrine. These medications can be effective for PPD in some cases. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) While less commonly prescribed due to potential side effects, TCAs like amitriptyline and nortriptyline may be considered when other options are not effective or well-tolerated. Atypical antidepressants Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an example of an atypical antidepressant that affects both dopamine and norepinephrine. It can be used as an alternative for individuals who have not responded to SSRIs or SNRIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs like phenelzine (Nardil) are usually reserved for cases where other treatments have failed due to their potential interactions with certain foods and medications. Yet, these medications can take weeks to work and may lead to side effects. Concerns about breastfeeding can also impact treatment decisions. Estrogen therapy stabilizes hormone levels linked to PPD, but it is still being studied, and its risks and side effects need more investigation. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps manage PPD symptoms by changing negative thought patterns. However, access to qualified therapists can be limited, and attending regular sessions might be challenging for new mothers. Recently FDA approved first oral treatment of zuranolone to treat PPD4. Zuranolone belongs to a class of drugs known as positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. GABA-A receptors are critical components of the central nervous system that play a crucial role in regulating mood, anxiety, and other emotional states. Zuranolone's mechanism of action involves enhancing the activity of GABA-A receptors. GABA-A receptors are inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, and their activation leads to a reduction in neuronal excitability, thereby promoting relaxation and calming effects. By acting as a positive allosteric modulator, zuranolone amplifies the response of GABA-A receptors to the neurotransmitter GABA, resulting in anxiolytic and antidepressant effects4. For treating PPD, the efficacy of Zurzuvae in adults was assessed by conducting two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind and multicenter studies5. During this phase 3 trial with a double-blind design, women experiencing severe PPD were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a daily dosage of 50 mg zuranolone or a placebo for a period of 14 days. The primary focus of the study was to assess the change in the total score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from their initial state on day 15. Noteworthy secondary objectives included measuring changes in HAM-D scores on days 3, 28, and 45, as well as evaluating the alteration in severity based on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-S) on day 15. Throughout the trial, adverse events were closely monitored and recorded. Among the 196 patients who were randomly assigned (zuranolone, N=98; placebo, N=98), a total of 170 participants (86.7%) successfully completed the 45-day study period. The utilization of zuranolone in comparison to the placebo yielded statistically notable enhancements in depressive symptoms by day 15. Moreover, significant amelioration in depressive symptoms was also noted5. Zuranolone can be more discreet and less stigmatizing compared to other forms of treatment, such as injections or hospital visits. This may encourage more individuals to seek help for their PPD symptoms. It will have higher rates of patient compliance since they are simple to take and integrate into daily routines. It can be distributed through a wider range of healthcare settings, potentially increasing accessibility to PPD treatment in both urban and rural areas. It can provide flexibility in dosing, allowing healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans to the individual needs of each patient. It can facilitate early intervention for PPD and has the potential to reduce hospitalization. Although zuranolone's FDA approval for PPD is promising, there are still some challenges to consider for its use. Not all individuals may respond equally to zuranolone, leading to variations in its effectiveness. Some women might experience significant improvements, while others might not see the same results. Like any medication, zuranolone could potentially have side effects ranging from mild to severe. Balancing the benefits with the potential risks is essential. The long-term effects of using zuranolone, especially during the postpartum period, need further exploration. Monitoring its impact on both maternal health and infant development is crucial. The accessibility of zuranolone could be a concern, as new medications might initially have a higher cost and limited availability, potentially limiting access for some individuals. Zuranolone's interactions with other medications or treatments that postpartum women might be taking should be thoroughly studied to avoid any adverse effects. PPD is a complex condition that can vary greatly between individuals. Finding the right dosage and treatment plan tailored to each woman's needs might require careful consideration. While zuranolone offers a pharmacological approach, it is important not to overlook the benefits of psychosocial interventions, such as therapy and support groups, in the overall treatment plan. Overcoming the stigma associated with PPD and seeking help is a challenge. Some women might be hesitant to use medication due to concerns about judgment or societal perceptions. Healthcare providers need to be adequately educated about zuranolone and its potential benefits and limitations to make informed decisions and provide comprehensive care. Determining the appropriate duration of zuranolone treatment and ensuring a smooth transition to other forms of support after discontinuation are important aspects to address. There remains a need for comprehensive studies that delve deeper into its long-term effects, interactions with other medications, and its impact on diverse populations. Rigorous clinical trials and longitudinal studies can provide invaluable insights into the treatment's efficacy, safety, and potential limitations. The approval of zuranolone could potentially have a broader impact beyond its application in PPD. As researchers and clinicians gain a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, there is a possibility that zuranolone's insights may extend to other mental health conditions.

Severe depressive states (e.g. major depressive episodes) are less common than minor depressive states.

Potential critical illness/intensive care-related risk factors include severity of organ failure, high-dose benzodiazepine administration, longer ICU stays, stressful ICU experiences, and early post-intensive care distress. Depressive symptoms in survivors are associated with impaired physical function, other psychiatric morbidity, cognitive and work difficulties, and lower health-related quality of life.

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AUTO-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLSCENTS",
      "abstract": "There are various external factors that cause feelings, favorable for the formation of suicidal behavior: misunderstanding, meaningful rejection by others, experienced abuse, loneliness, alienation; loss of parental love, love – the key negative emotions are jea-lousy, death, divorce, escape from the family of some of the parents – despair, insult, jealousy; contempt, amazed selfishness – insult, anger, hatred, aggression as a desire to revenge, etc. It has been established that approximately half of examples of suicidal youth behavior are associated with destructive family problems, with a negative attitude towards them.Interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict in the conditions of social, psychological, existential crisis on the background of mental disadaptation can acquire a suicidogenic character. In all cases, the crucial moment in the formation of manifestation of suicidal behavior is precisely a suicidogenic conflict. Adoption of a suicidal decision (regardless of the causes, conditions, forms of maladaptation) occurs only after the phase of personal re-development of suicidogenic conflict.In our study, the group of suicide risk is totally 27.2 %. Researchers from this risk group are less readers of books, play computer games, attend interest groups, but are more on the streets and do their home affairs. They have significantly more problems with their father, mother, brothers and sisters, and their peers. They are mostly dissatisfied with the degree of realization of material and spiritual needs in their family. In the vast majority of high school students of the risk group, there are high levels of anxiety and mental and physical exhaustion, the experience of loneliness, hopelessness, irrationality of existence.In a greater number of senior pupils-licetists a factor of high anxiety was the fear of not meeting the expectations of others. Analysis of the data of the questionnaires of high school students of the risk group allowed to highlight and describe the main variants of individual images of states that can lead to auto-aggressive behavior of young people. The most striking feature is the sense of guilt, which arises as a result of inadequate assessment of one’s own actions or intentions, numerous, often groundless, self-excuse, hyperbolization of their mistakes, impairment of achievements, reproach of conscientiousness, and the desire to get out of life.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "title": "Bipolar disorders: new approaches to therapy",
      "abstract": "This article reviews the evidence supporting different somatic treatment strategies in the acute and maintenance treatment phases of bipolar disorder. Bipolar affective disorder is a chronic disorder with a life time incidence of 0.3 - 1.5/100 [1]. Severe affective disorder is associated with a risk of completed suicide of 6 - 15% [2,3]. Traditionally, bipolar disorder has been considered as an episodic disorder with good inter-episode recovery [4]. This is being increasingly challenged with patients demonstrating social, marital, occupational and cognitive dysfunction, even when euthymic [5]. The management of bipolar disorder should be considered in the context of; the type of episode, this may be manic, depressed or mixed; the degree and rate of recovery; the cycling frequency and precipitant, if any, for recurrence and the onset and evolution of the underlying illness. On average, four episodes occur every 10 years. However 13 - 24% of patients develop rapid cycling disorder, in which four or more episodes occur within a year. Patients with bipolar disorder often have co-morbid anxiety and substance abuse. Moreover, axis I co-morbidity may be associated with an earlier age at onset and worsening course of bipolar illness [6]. Axis II co-morbidity is also common, this was highlighted in a study by Kay and colleagues who, after excluding patients with a history of alcohol misuse, demonstrated axis II co-morbidity in almost a quarter of euthymic bipolar patients [7]. Good practice relies on an overall management plan that incorporates somatic, psychological and social approaches. This paper will focus on one element of such a plan, the currently available somatic management strategies for bipolar disorder.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Learning disorders (LD) are disorders interfering with academic performance or with daily living activities requiring reading, writing, or mathematical abilities in subjects with a normal intelligence quotient. The prevalence of LD in the general population has been found to be 2–10% and reading disorders are the most frequent subtype. Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurological disorders in childhood with an estimated prevalence in 4–5/1,000. Epilepsy is considered to be idiopathic or cryptogenic in approximately two‐thirds of cases. LD are more common in people with epilepsy than in the general population: about 25% of patients with epilepsy are said to have LD. Various psychosocial, medication‐related, and epilepsy‐related factors may be associated with LD in epilepsy. LD can be either permanent or state‐dependent. Permanent LD are caused by a brain lesion and/or a stable brain dysfunction. In contrast, state‐dependent LD are potentially reversible and treatable; they are caused by epilepsy‐related factors. If allowed to persist for a long period, a state‐dependent LD may become permanent.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The drug-induced movement disorders discussed in this chapter are uncommon, consisting of less than 24% of all drug-induced movement disorders and less than 0.7% of all spontaneously reported adverse drug reactions [1]. The prompt identification of these disorders by the specialist neurologist or general physician prescribing the drug is critical in the effective management of the patient and in some cases the prevention of long-term sequelae. Much of the evidence that a drug causes a movement disorder is based on single case reports. It is therefore often difficult to know for certain whether there is a causal relationship. Movement disorders which improve after drug withdrawal are more likely to be attributable to the drug and can be confirmed by reintroduction of the drug (ethically this be can only justified if it is important for the patient's long-term therapy). However, we should be alert to the possibility that some drugsmay cause irreversible cellular changes which could either be the sole cause of the movement disorder or contribute in some way to its generation in susceptible individuals.",

      "abstract": "Das ADHS als häufige psychische Störung im Kindes- und Jugendalter wurde in den letzten Jahren zunehmend Gegenstand wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen. Dabei hat sich gezeigt, dass dieses Störungsbild nicht nur im Kindes- bzw. Jugendalter in Erscheinung treten kann, sondern dass ein Teil der Betroffenen bis in das Erwachsenenalter hinein Beschwerden behält. Während sich die motorischen Auffälligkeiten beim Übergang von der Adoleszenz in das Erwachsenenalter im Allgemeinen zurückbilden, persistieren Störungen der Aufmerksamkeit und der Impulskontrolle. Das wachsende Interesse an den neurobiologischen Ursachen des ADHS schlägt sich in einer Vielzahl von Studien über die Störung auch im Erwachsenenalter nieder. Noch ist unverstanden, warum der Reifungsprozess bei einigen Kindern und Jugendlichen eine Konsolidierung erfährt, während andere ihre Defizite bis in das Erwachsenenalter behalten. Darüber hinaus ist ungeklärt, ob das ADHS im Erwachsenenalter im Alterungsprozess weitere Umformungen erlebt. Über das Erscheinungsbild eines ADHS im hohen Lebensalter ist kaum etwas bekannt. Erste Studien gehen dieser Frage nach und liefern Hinweise darauf, dass auch bei alten Menschen Residuen eines ADHS gefunden werden können.",

The symptoms included depressive state, delusion, confusion, psychomotor excitement and delirium, all of which disappeared in about two months. At first, we regarded all the symptoms as alcoholic hallucinosis, by a clinical standpoint, in spite of no auditory hallucination in this case. However, taking the overall clinical course into consideration, withdrawal syndrome could have been affected by some factors. One of the possibilities is that delusion might have been induced by aripiprazole. There still may be some other unknown influential factors on withdrawal, which are indicated by previous papers.",

      "abstract": "It is known that mood disorders in women explicitly relates to estrogen production. Except for these findings phenomenon as Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, directly connected to menstrual cycle in women, is widely discussed. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a set of subjectively unpleasant mental and somatic symptoms. It appears in luteal phase of ovarian cycle. During menstruation it remits and disappears up to one week from its termination. DSM IV classified PMDD into the category of \"Other specific depressive disorders\" and further revision DSM IV-TR classifies PMDD as a separate strictly defined psychiatric diagnosis. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) does not include any specific category as PMDD or similar. The closest category F38.8 does not represent the core of the phenomenon because it relates only to general depressive symptomatology and does not give specific diagnostic criteria to menstrual cycle related mood disorders (Grady-Weliky, 2003). In the presented article, possible effectivity of PMDD treatment with the focus to antidepressants of SSRI type (Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors) is discussed. In spite of interesting and significant findings, the treatment of PMDD and accordingly PMS is above all multidisciplinary question and it must be treated like that.",

It is important to distinguish these from the symptoms of an ongoing or latent medical or psychiatric condition that are magnified in the premenstrual period. A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness. The complex downstream effects of cycling estrogen and progesterone are believed to account for the multitude of possible manifestations of these disorders as well as for the exacerbation of certain medical and psychiatric conditions in relation to the menstrual cycle.",

      "title": "Contribution of methotrexate in precipitation of manic episode in bipolar affective disorder explored: a case report",
      "abstract": "Bipolar affective disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of mania with or without, but commonly with, episodes of depression. It usually begins in adolescence and can cause enduring and substantial impairment if left untreated. It needs a long-term treatment with mood stabilizers to prevent relapses. Elevated or depressed mood relapses can be either primary or secondary. However, primary mood relapses can occur without a significant precipitating factor, more often tending to occur following stressful life events or discontinuation of mood stabilizer medications. Secondary mood relapses can be caused by many conditions, such as physical illnesses, substance misuse and medications. When a mental illness coexists with another physical illness and the treatment of one complicates the other, it adds complexity to the selection of appropriate pharmacological regime for either condition. In this paper, the authors present a case of bipolar affective disorder who had two episodes of mania likely precipitated by methotrexate, which were reversed by the withdrawal of the offending drug (methotrexate). To the best of the authors' knowledge, to date there have been no published reports in the literature in which methotrexate, an immunosuppressive and a cytotoxic drug, precipitated a manic episode in a patient with bipolar affective disorder.",

Significantly more women scoring ⩾ 8 on the Highs scale at 3 days postpartum went on to manifest depression at 6 weeks than did subjects with no psychopathology in the early puerperium.

Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

Presentamos el caso de un varón de 90 años con antecedentes de degeneración macular asociada a la edad avanzada y ceguera legal, que consultó por la aparición de alucinaciones visuales nítidas, complejas y estructuradas, reconocidas por él como irreales. Las alucinaciones incluían figuras humanas, animales y escenas en movimiento, sin componente auditivo ni afectación emocional asociada. El examen psiquiátrico reveló un estado cognitivo conservado (MMSE 28/30) y sin signos de psicosis o demencia. La evaluación geriátrica integral mostró una buena funcionalidad general, y la neuroimagen descartó lesiones estructurales cerebrales. Ante la ausencia de patología neurológica o psiquiátrica concomitante, se estableció la impresión diagnóstica de SCB. El manejo incluyó psicoeducación al paciente y a su familia, optimización del entorno visual y una pauta baja de quetiapina (12,5 mg/noche) con buena tolerancia y respuesta favorable. El caso subraya la importancia del reconocimiento del SCB en el contexto de la pérdida visual severa en personas mayores. El desconocimiento del síndrome puede llevar a diagnósticos erróneos de demencia o psicosis, con consecuencias innecesarias. Un abordaje multidisciplinar centrado en la educación, el soporte visual y, en casos seleccionados, el tratamiento farmacológico sintomático, puede mejorar significativamente la calidad de vida del paciente.",

      "abstract": "In an attempt to validate recent assertions that the strongest indicators of hysteria are the \"positive\" findings in the neurological examination, seven of the most accepted features (history of hypochondriasis, secondary gain, la belle indifference, nonanatomical sensory loss, split of midline by pain or vibratory stimulation, changing boundaries of hypalgesia, giveaway weakness) were sought in 30 consecutive neurology service admissions with acute structural nervous system damage. All subjects showed at least one of these findings; most presented three or four. The presence of these \"positive\" findings of hysteria in patients with acute structural brain disease invalidates their use as pathognomonic evidence of hysteria. A second, retrospective study on the misdiagnosis of hysteria demonstrated that women, homosexual men, the psychiatrically ill, and patients presenting plausible psychogenie explanations for their illness are most liable to be misdiagnosed. Certain disorders, particularly movement disorders and paralysis, are most often mislabeled as hysteria. A diagnosis of hysteria must be made with great caution as it so often proves incorrect.",

The majority of the patients (n-52) presented with generalized seizures with a complex development of generalized and partial motor disturbances throughout the entire paroxysm. The disturbances were divided into 3 variants. Referred to the first variant are convulsive manifestations in the structure of grand mal epilepsy when, in the presence of bilateral convulsions, they were predominant in the facial muscles on one side or muscles of the anterior or posterior aspect of the body. If generalized seizures were more predominant on one side, such motor disorders were attributed to the 2nd variant. The 3rd variant of generalized epileptic seizures was characterized by asymmetric convulsions.",

      "title": "Persistent Delusional Disorder Presenting as Munchausen by Proxy - A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Delusion is a false, unshakable belief that is out of keeping with the patient’s social and cultural background (Patricia Casey et al, 2019). Persistent delusional disorder (PDD) is characterized by the development either of a single delusion or of a set of related delusions which are usually persistent and sometimes lifelong. Often they are persecutory, hypochondriacal, or grandiose, but they may be concerned with litigation or jealously, or express a conviction that the individual’s body is misshapen, or that others think that he or she smells or is homosexual (ICD-10 classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders). Delusional disorder with delusions of infidelity has been called conjugal paranoia or Othello syndrome (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2015). Munchausen syndrome was first termed by Asher in 1951. Munchausen syndrome by proxy, essentially, is a form of child abuse in which a parent, usually the mother, or a caregiver repeatedly fabricates or actually inflicts injury or illness in a child for whom medical intervention is then sought, often in an emergency setting (Sadock &amp; Sadock, 2015). This case report presents one such beautiful case, where a father with persistent delusional disorder repeatedly fabricates an illness in his daughter, and make multiple requests to medicate his daughter. The core component of the delusional belief was infidelity. Initially, it was difficult to find any psychopathology in the daughter, except for some maladaptive reaction formation to frequent altercations with the father. Subsequently, it was realized that the father had persistent delusional belief related to his daughter’s fidelity (which was not corroborated by the daughter or other relatives). Personality can play a role in the genesis of delusional states; abnormally suspicious personalities can react to difficulties with deepening ideas of persecution, or may slowly develop delusions of marital infidelity or bodily ill health. One basic difference between Schizophrenia and PDD, is that delusions in PDD are well systematized, with one basic delusion and remainder of the system being logically built on this error (Patricia Casey et al, 2019). Persistent delusional disorders lack other psychopathology like hallucinations seen in Schizophrenia. Keywords: Persistent Delusional Disorder, Munchausen by Proxy, Infidelity, Paranoia",

The abnormal aspects of parenting or caring which may cause significant harm to children are seen to a lesser extent in many, if not most families, at different points in time. The line between worrying behaviour on the part of parents and emotional abuse is ill-defined and, except in extreme cases, a decision to intervene can usually only be made after concerns persist.",

The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state. A theory of possible \"asthenic metabolic changes\" due to disturbances in the hormonal-vegetative system, and its practical application were discussed.",

Not sufficiently well recognized as part of the suprasellar tumor syndrome is the occurrence of sudden visual loss with scotomas in the visual fields, associated with more or less prominent headache.

Patients with unstable PDs (USPD; borderline, narcissistic, histrionic, and antisocial PDs) were compared with all other depressives. Considering patients of all ages, USPD was unrelated to course and weakly related to suicidal behavior. In post hoc analyses, patients were divided into “younger” (aged 18—25) and “older” (over 25). USPD but not other PDs predicted more episodes of depression, more manipulative suicidal behavior, and more medically serious suicide attempts among older depressives. USPD was unrelated to prognosis among younger depressives. This may be because many young USPDs will reach higher levels of adaptive functioning over several years, whereas USPDs still requiring hospitalization beyond their mid-20s tend to have more intractable character pathology with poorer long-term prognosis.",

DB has not been highlighted in Alzheimer disease (AD) yet. We describe eight cases with advanced AD showing DB phenomenon. In the eight advanced AD patients with DB (7 women and 1man, age ranging from 52 to 84 years old), we performed clinical history, neurological examination, bruxism rate evaluation by video monitoring, Mini-mental status examination (MMSE) and united Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS) motor score evaluation. All the patients had no previous history of sleep bruxism, long-term antipsychotics exposure, or preceding dental or oral problems. They developed DB after 5 to 8 years (mean 5.6 years) after having diagnosed as AD and 6 to 8 years (mean 7.6 years) after AD symptoms developed. DB was not accompanied by limb or oromandibular involuntary movements or dyskinesia except in case 2 (myoclonus). The rate of bruxism as assessed by video ranged from 1 to 2.5 Hz. It has been known that frontal involvement of advanced AD may play a role in developing DB via efferent and afferent striatopallidal tracts. DB is also associated with disruption of diverse neurotransmitters systems, especially dopaminergic pathway. Although the exact pathogenesis of DB of our patients remains unclear, DB in advanced AD may be associated with dopaminergic system involvement. Our study suggests that DB can be another involuntary movement observed in advanced AD.",

      "abstract": "La esclerosis lateral amiotrófica (ELA) es un trastorno neurodegenerativo que afecta principalmente al sistema motor, pero en el que se reconocen cada vez más las manifestaciones extramotoras. La pérdida de neuronas motoras superiores e inferiores en la corteza motora, los núcleos del tronco encefálico y el asta anterior de la médula espinal da lugar a una debilidad muscular progresiva y atrofia. ALS a menudo tiene un inicio focal, pero posteriormente se propaga a diferentes regiones del cuerpo, donde la falla de los músculos respiratorios generalmente limita la supervivencia de 2 a 5 años después del inicio de la enfermedad. Hasta en el 50% de los casos existen manifestaciones extramotoras como cambios en el comportamiento, disfunción ejecutiva y problemas del lenguaje. En el 10%-15% de los pacientes, estos problemas son lo suficientemente graves como para cumplir los criterios clínicos de demencia frontotemporal (DFT). En el 10% de los pacientes con ELA, los antecedentes familiares sugieren un patrón de herencia autosómico dominante. El 90% restante no tiene familiares afectados y se clasifican como ELA esporádica. Las causas de la ELA parecen ser heterogéneas y solo se comprenden parcialmente. Hasta la fecha, se han asociado más de 20 genes con la ELA. La causa genética más común es una expansión repetida de hexanucleótidos en el Gen C9orf72 , responsable del 30-50% de la ELA familiar y del 7% de la ELA esporádica. Estas expansiones también son una causa frecuente de demencia frontotemporal, lo que enfatiza la superposición molecular entre ALS y DFT. Hasta el día de hoy, no existe una cura o un tratamiento eficaz para la ELA y la piedra angular del tratamiento sigue siendo la atención multidisciplinaria, que incluye el apoyo nutricional y respiratorio y el control de los síntomas. En esta revisión, se discuten diferentes aspectos de la ELA, incluida la epidemiología, la etiología, la patogenia, las características clínicas, el diagnóstico diferencial, las investigaciones, el tratamiento y las perspectivas futuras.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors are disorders involving partial arousal from deep, non–rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in which individuals simultaneously display characteristics of both sleep and wakefulness. Sleepwalking represents the milder form of arousal, while night terrors are distinguished by the intense physiological experiences associated with alarm: screaming, pounding heart, rapid breathing, sweating, extreme terror or panic, and possibly frenzied motor activity. Both sleepwalking and night terrors usually occur during the first 3 hours after falling asleep but may occur at any time of night. They arise from non-REM sleep, generally sleep stages 3 or 4. There may be physical signs of traumatic injuries sustained during episodes of sleepwalking or night terrors. Most patients with sleepwalking/night terrors have a childhood history and/or a family history of these behaviors. There may also be a history of bedwetting.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Article abstract</i></b> Gray matter heterotopia are common malformations of cortical development. From a clinical perspective, affected patients are best divided into three groups: subependymal, subcortical, and band heterotopia (also called double cortex). Symptomatic women with subependymal heterotopia typically present with partial epilepsy during the second decade of life; development and neurologic examinations up to that point are typically normal. Symptoms in men with subependymal heterotopia vary, depending on whether they have the X-linked or autosomal form. Men with the X-linked form more commonly have associated CNS and visceral anomalies; their development is typically abnormal. Symptomatic men with the autosomal variety have clinical courses similar to symptomatic women. Both men and women with subcortical heterotopia typically have congenital fixed neurologic deficits and develop partial epilepsy during the second half of the first decade of life. The more extensive the subcortical heterotopia, the greater the deficit; bilateral heterotopia are almost invariably associated with severe developmental delay or mental retardation. In general, band heterotopia are seen exclusively in women; men with a mutation of the related gene (called <i>XLIS</i> or <i>DCX</i>) usually die in utero or have a much more severe brain anomaly. Symptoms in affected women vary from normal to severe developmental delay or mental retardation; the severity of the syndrome is related to the thickness of the band of arrested neurons. Nearly all affected patients that come to medical attention have epilepsy, with partial complex and atypical absence epilepsy being the most common syndromes. Some of the more severely affected patients develop drop attacks.",

      "title": "Die manierierte Katatonie",
      "abstract": "Manneristic catatonia, one form of Leonhard's systematic schizophrenias, is illustrated in nine case notes. The essential syndrome of this rare disorder (described by Leonhard in the preneuroleptic era) consisted in mannerisms and progressive stiffness of psychomotor activity. Mannerisms often developed from obsessive and compulsive ideas; whereas distress disappeared, repetitive behavior developed into a stereotype. Complex movements (e.g. not to shake hands; mutism) became mannerisms. With disease progression stiffness of facial expression and gestures and an impairment of voluntary motor activity became increasingly prominent. There were no signs of (neuroleptic-induced) parkinsonism. Manneristic catatonia affects preponderantly men and exhibits an early age of onset (median: 23 years). In none of the cases a family history of psychiatric illness was noted. Severe obstetric and birth complications as well as the high prevalence of supratentorial and cerebellar CT/MR abnormalities in this patient group point to deviations of prenatal brain maturation. The median yearly dose of neuroleptics was 83.1 g chlorpromazin equivalents. The characteristic psychopathology was not essentially influenced by modern psychopharmacological treatment neither in the beginning nor in the long run irrespective of the time of onset of the disease. Continuous high-dose neuroleptic treatment is not efficacious in this distinct group of systematic schizophrenias. Behavioural training in a rehabilitation unit is the treatment of choice from the early beginning.",

      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

The attacks developed before 2 years of age and were as frequent as 50 or more each day. Electroencephalographic recording during seizures revealed a similar pattern in all patients. Tactile stimulation evoked long-latency (60 to 125 msec), brief bursts of widespread, bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical EEG discharges. They occurred before, synchronous with, or after the myoclonus. A defective descending inhibitory system may lead to development of both the EEG discharges and the myoclonus in response to a peripheral sensory stimulus.",

However, it can considerably reduce motivation to the treatment, overcoming the illness, increase the risk of suicidal behavior and in general worsen the quality of their life. Manifestations of the depressed mood of cancer patients are similar to manifestations of the depressed mood of the patients having chronic or deadly diseases. However, there are features which depend on some factors, the most important of which is the disease stage. The results obtained allow to draw a conclusion that the features of the depressed mood at the second stage of the disease are connected with acceptation of the diagnosis and can manifest in the feeling of a punishment expectation, loss of interests in previous hobbies and communication restrictions; the features of a depressed mood at the third stage are determined by the disease dynamics and the further forecast, and can manifest in the analysis of the previous mistakes, absence of of hopes for the future, disgust for themselves and feeling of uselessness.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common psychiatric disorder in the peripartum period affecting approximately 8% of European women without prior psychiatric history [1] and even more with pre-existing depressive disorders. Up to 70% of new mothers develop mild depressive symptoms called “baby-blues” which include weepiness, sadness and mood lability. Those symptoms usually peak between 2 and 5 days post-delivery and abate spontaneously within days up to 2 weeks [2]. In contrast to “baby blues” postpartum depression can have a serious impact on functioning and even lead to suicidality rendering it highly important to detect the disorder as early as possible. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [3] is widely used to screen for postpartum depression and should be applied to all new mothers who develop depressive symptoms such as loss of interest, hopelessness and depressive feelings. Several risk factors for postpartum depression have been identified: Prenatal depression poses the highest risk, followed by low self-esteem, childcare stress, prenatal anxiety, life stress and lack of social support [4]. Postpartum depression is a treatable condition, however, it has to be distinguished from bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis, which require different treatment strategies [2].",

      "title": "Diagnosis 2.0 Are Mental Illnesses Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes? A Major Challenge for the DSM-V Committees as They Revise the Diagnostic \"Bible\" of Psychiatric Disorders Is to Determine Whether Mental Illnesses Are Diseases, Disorders, or Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "abstract": "Physical illness is a frequent event in everyone's life and in most cases has no particular effect on the psychological structure of the individual. However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "abstract": "Controlled studies in the United States, UK, and Spain have consistently found that approximately 75% of patients who experience sexual side effects from prescribed medication will not volunteer this information without direct questioning. Nonetheless, many clinicians do not have easy access to reliable information concerning sexual side effects of pharmacological agents. This handy reference provides up-to-date and rapid access to the latest available data concerning sexual side effects of various pharmacological agents for psychiatrists and physicians. Initial chapters are devoted to a brief review of the physiology of sexual function, the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the general population, and how to identify drug-induced sexual dysfunction. Following the initial overview chapters, subsequent chapters are be grouped by classes of drugs, allowing clinicians and physicians rapid access to clinically relevant information. Separate chapters are devoted to data concerning sexual side effects of antidepressants, antianxiety drugs, antipsychotic agents, antihypertensives, urological agents, cardiovascular drugs, and other classes of drugs. The chapters focus on common sexual side effects that may be unspoken causes of treatment noncompliance such as inability to ejaculate, anorgasmia, difficulty in reaching orgasm, erectile dysfunction, and lubrication failure. Reports of decreased libido are often difficult to interpret; for that reason, data concerning libido will only be reported if the evidence clearly supports a diagnosis of disturbed libido as a drug side effect. Final chapters are devoted to pharmacological treatment of sexual disorders.",

      "title": "We've all been wrong about provisional tic disorder",
      "abstract": "Provisional Tic Disorder (PTD) is common in childhood. The received wisdom among clinicians is that PTD is short-lived and mild, with at most a few tics, and rarely includes complex tics, premonitory phenomena or comorbid illnesses. However, such conclusions come from clinical experience, with biased ascertainment and limited follow-up. Prospective study of 89 children with tics starting 0–9 months ago (median 4 months), fewer than half from clinical sources. Follow-up at 12 (± 24, 36, 48) months after the first tic. At study entry, many children had ADHD (39), an anxiety disorder (27), OCD (9) or enuresis (17). All had at least two current tics, with a mean total since onset of 6.9 motor and 2.0 phonic tics. Forty-one had experienced a complex tic, and 69 could suppress some tics. Tics were clinically meaningful: 64 had tics severe enough for a clinical trial, and 76 families sought medical attention for the tics. At 12 months, 79 returned, and 78 still had tics. Of these, 29 manifested no tics during history and extended examination, but only via audio-visual monitoring when the child was seated alone. Only 12/70 now had plans to see a doctor for tics. Most who returned at 2–4 years still had tics known to the child and family, but medical impact was low. Our results do not contradict previous data, but overturn clinical lore. The data strongly argue against the longstanding but arbitrary tradition of separating tic disorders into recent-onset versus chronic.",

There was no relation between the clinicians’ diagnoses of depression and psychometric scores. Little relation was found between performance on the cognitive tests and the number of depressive features (maximum, 9) reported by the individual or collateral source.

During this age period the most different interrelationships between depressions and somatic pathology can be observed: Depressions can be concomitants of somatic pathology or pathogenetically connected with somatic diseases most often with pathology of nervous, cardiovascular, and endocrine systems and osteoarticular apparatus (somatogenic depressions). Psychogenic and medicamentous depressions can also exist [1-4].

      "abstract": "In the weeks leading up to menstruation, the majority of women of reproductive age experience some physical discomfort or distress. Although symptoms are frequently not severe enough to interfere significantly with daily activities, they can be. Thus, severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects 5–8% of women; the majority of these individuals also match the criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The most bothersome symptoms are those that affect mood and behaviour, such as irritability, tension, depression, weepiness, and mood swings, however physical issues like breast soreness and bloating can also be a concern. We discuss two basic treatments for severe PMS: one that targets the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis and the other that targets brain serotonergic synapses. We also present theories regarding the underlying causes of severe PMS. The symptoms are caused by fluctuations in gonadal hormone levels, hence treatments that stop ovarian cyclicity, such as long acting analogues of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or oestradiol (given as patches or implants), can successfully diminish the symptoms. It is also widely known that serotonin reuptake inhibitors, whether used continuously or just during luteal stages, are helpful.",

There are high levels of association of many of these chronic conditions with psychiatric disorders. Comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions increase use of medical resources and costs, as well as amplify functional impairment. For example, depression is associated with an approximately 50 per cent increase in medical costs of chronic medical illness, even after controlling for severity of physical illness. Dementia is associated with hospital costs up to 75 per cent higher than for non-demented patients. As important as a comprehensive knowledge of psychiatric diagnosis and psychosocial formulation is to a consulting psychiatrist, it is also vital to understand the pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of the medical and surgical conditions that frequently coexist with psychiatric disorders. It is also important to know the behavioural and psychiatric side effects of medications and substances. Lacking this data permits only a partial and inadequate approach to diagnosis and treatment. This section describes general medical disorders associated with psychiatric syndromes. The pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of the medical disorder are described first, followed by psychiatric syndromes often seen with that diagnosis.",

The physical dependence characterized by a state of distress and an overpowering desire to consume more ethanol, assumes three forms: ( a) “inability to stop” the ingestion (Jellinek's “loss of control”) noted moments after ingesting a small quantity of ethanol following a period of abstinence, which characterizes the gamma or intermittent clinical form of alcoholism; ( b) “inability to abstain” from ethanol hours after the last ingestion and after continuous drinking (each 4 to 8 hours during months or years), which characterizes the delta or inveterate clinical form of alcoholism, and ( c) primary physical dependence without ethanol having necessarily been ingested previously, which characterizes remittent, or epsilon alcoholism or dipsomania.",

      "abstract": "Besides cognitive changes, dementia disorders have other very important symptoms. Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

      "abstract": "Priapism is a rare urological emergency characterized by painful erection exceeding 4-6 h and generally occurring independently of sexual desire and sexual relations. The etiology is broad and various. The ischemic type represents 95% of all cases of priapism. No cause is determined in 60% of cases of ischemic priapism, while hematological diseases, a history of drug use, malignity or a history of neurological disease can be identified in 40%. The drugs most commonly associated with priapism are antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticoagulants and antihypertensives. Although antipsychotic agents are implicated in 15-26% of cases of priapism, the mechanism involved in drug-associated priapism is unclear. The peripheral alpha 1 blocking activities of psychotropic agents or central serotonin-like activities are, however, implicated. The phenothiazine group antipsychotic agents chlorpromazine and thioridazine have the highest alpha adrenergic activity and are the antipsychotics most reported in association with priapism. Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic with high alpha 1 antagonistic activity, and cases of priapism associated with use of chlorpromazine at varying doses and for varying durations have been reported. In this case report, the priapism in the patient with schizoaffective disorder is associated with intramuscular injection of chlorpromazine, in this regard the priapism cases and predictive factors in the literature is reviewed for the aim of increasing the sensitivity of clinician across the adverse effects of drugs and the importance of adequate psychiatric history and medical history taking and registering adverse effects of drugs is emphasized.",

All patients were in clinical remission from at least 3 months (PANNS and BPRS). Exclusion criteria were any history of other psychiatric or neurological disorders and alcohol or drug abuse. Prodromal symptoms were assessed with the scale of prodromal symptoms (SOPS) developed by Mc Glashan. It is a heteroquestionnaire for patients and their parents. The mean duration of prodromal phase was about 2 years with extremes ranging from 6 months to 4 years. The most severe prodromal symptoms were suspiciousness/ persecutory ideas, social isolation, dysphoric mood and impaired tolerance to normal stress The most frequent prodromal symptoms were impaired tolerance to normal stress, dysphoric mood, sleep disturbance, social isolation and suspiciousness/ persecutory ideas.

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual dysfunction in men may be related to multiple factors according to the type of sexual problems (e.g. low desire, erectile, or ejaculatory disturbances). Organic and psychological factors both contribute to the development of male sexual dysfunction. Among organic causes, endocrine disorders (the most important of which is hypogonadism) may contribute to the occurrence of male sexual dysfunction, but are much less frequent than other organic causes (i.e. vascular, neurological, and drug-induced). Clinical assessment (including a sexual history) is important for identifying patients with hormonal (e.g. testosterone deficiency) or other disorders (e.g. vascular or neurological) who may present with symptomatic sexual dysfunction. The aetiology(ies) underlying the sexual dysfunction will guide the most appropriate treatment in individual cases. Management of male sexual dysfunction may include psychological counselling, pharmacological therapy (e.g. PDE5Is), surgery, and testosterone replacement therapy in cases of well-documented hypogonadism. Despite the recent improvements due to the use of PDE5Is, in the management of erectile dysfunction remains largely unsatisfactory for a significant proportion of patients so there is still a major treatment gap and challenge ahead.",

It is characterized primarily by one or more non-bizarre delusions, and according to the content of delusions, can be divided into five subtypes: persecution, jealousy, erotomanic, somatic and grandeur. We present a case of a patient with Jealousy Delusional Disorder and discuss the main difficulties that arise in the differential diagnosis and treatment. In the differential diagnosis is essential to eliminate the pathologies of organic causes that may have delusions as clinical manifestation. It is then necessary to distinguish delusion from obsessive ideas and overvalued ideas that can lead to misdiagnosis and therefore have serious implications in monitoring and treating of these patients. The subtype of jealousy seems to have a better evolution and prognosis compared with others subtypes reported. Although the Delusional Disorder present a more favorable course and usually is associated with a smaller disturbance in the overall functioning of the patients, they have a poor compliance to psychiatric treatment. So, they often stop psychiatry follow-up and discontinue therapy.",

      "abstract": "A 2-year-old, developmentally normal, boy presented with multiple seizure-like events over 10 days. These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

      "abstract": "The appearance preoccupations trigger feelings of depression, anxiety, distress, shame, or other painful emotions. These emotions, in turn, trigger repetitive compulsive behaviors that are intended to alleviate the emotional distress [5] . As required by DSM-5 criterion B (which is new to DSM-5), all individuals with BDD perform excessive repetitive behaviors in response to the preoccupations with appearance at some time during the course of the disorder [1] . These repetitive behaviors have many similarities to OCD compulsions, and thus they are commonly referred to as compulsions or rituals. Common excessive behaviors include checking mirrors, excessive grooming, seeking reassurance about the perceived defects, skin picking (to try to minimize perceived blemishes), and tanning (e.g. to darken ‘pale’ skin) [3] . Some BDD compulsions consist of mental acts, such as comparing one’s own appearance with that of other people, rather than observable behaviors [3] . The repetitive behaviors are difficult to control and occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day [4, 5] . Nearly all patients camouflage the perceived defects (e.g. with a hat, makeup, hair, clothes, body position). Although camouflaging is a safety behavior, it can also be done repeatedly (e.g. reapplying makeup 20 times a day), in which case it may be considered a repetitive behavior [3] . Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is common yet very under-recognized. It has a point prevalence of about 2%, making it more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa or schizophrenia [1] . BDD typically causes tremendous suffering and substantial impairment in psychosocial functioning. The rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide appear markedly high. Yet treatment research on BDD lags very far behind that of other common and severe disorders. Thus, the study by Veale et al. [2] is a major contribution to the literature and to patient care. Individuals with BDD (previously known as ‘dysmorphophobia’) are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their appearance; these defects, however, are not observable or appear only slight to others (DSM-5 criterion A) [1] . Preoccupations most often focus on skin (e.g. perceived acne, scarring, wrinkles, color), nose (e.g. size or asymmetry) and hair (e.g. too little hair) but may focus on any body area [3] . Patients typically describe the disliked body parts as ‘ugly’, ‘unattractive’, ‘hideous’, or even ‘monstrous’. The preoccupations occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day (usually for at least an hour a day). They are intrusive, unwanted, and usually difficult to resist and control [4, 5] .

In the present narrative review different possible physiopathological mechanisms are discussed, including the role of stress and the regulation of prolactin secretion in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which can be evaluated clinically with endocrinological functional tests.

He describes previous occasional or short-term relationships and premature ejaculation on his first sexual experiences. During a phase without relationships, he began to discover his sexuality through masturbation, which tended to occur very frequently. He reported to especially appreciate the instant that precedes ejaculation, which led him to constantly try to delay the moment of ejaculation. Finding himself in a stable relationship, he reports that he cannot ejaculate during intercourse, achieving it only through masturbation, despite he could obtain sexual pleasure and have a sustained erection. At this point, the couple decided to have sex therapy. Premature ejaculation is a psychosexual disturbance defined as a persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it to occur. The main option for treating premature ejaculation are behavioral therapies such as the stop-start technique. In this case, the patient used this technique autonomously, by the means of masturbation, to delay his ejaculation, leading him to the point of being unable to ejaculate during intercourse.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Fibromyalgia is an entity that affects approximately 2% of the population, mainly women. According to many studies, approximately half of women with fibromyalgia have a history of traumatic events during childhood or adulthood. Affective disorders before and after fibromyalgia diagnosis are particularly frequent. Materials and methods: Comprehensive review of the scientific literature (Medline, Psychoinfo, Medex) on psychiatric comorbidity in women diagnosed with fibromyalgia published over the last three years. Results: 40-60% of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia report sexual abuse during childhood or adulthood; A higher percentage of women (over 70%) report other kinds of physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia has been linked to mood disorders in 50-70% of patients. More precisely, it appears in combination with major depression in 20% of cases. To a lesser but still noteworthy extent, women with fibromyalgia are also diagnosed with dysthymia, anxiety disorders, phobias or panic disorders. Conclusion: Despite the common characteristics of these patients there is no such thing as a “fibromyalgic personality”. As for comorbidity, mood disorders are highly prevalent, more specifically depression, even though no direct relationship has been established between them. Fibromyalgia symptoms are more acute in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders.",

The diagnosis of VP is mainly based on the patient history and requires: A) at least ten attacks of spontaneous spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 1 minute; C) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; D) response to a treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine; and F) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. Probable VP is defined as follows: A) at least five attacks of spinning or non-spinning vertigo; B) duration less than 5 minutes; C) spontaneous occurrence or provoked by certain head-movements; D) stereotyped phenomenology in a particular patient; E) not better accounted for by another diagnosis.Ephaptic discharges in the proximal part of the 8th cranial nerve, which is covered by oligodendrocytes, are the assumed mechanism. Important differential diagnoses are Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, epileptic vestibular aura, paroxysmal brainstem attacks (in multiple sclerosis or after brainstem stroke), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, perilymph fistula, transient ischemic attacks and panic attacks. Current areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis of VP are: a) MRI findings of vascular compression which are not diagnostic of the disease or predictive for the affected side because they are also observed in about 30% of healthy asymptomatic subjects; and b) response to treatment with carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine supports the diagnosis but there are so far no randomized controlled trials for treatment of VP.",

Sus efectos extrapiramidales incluyen cinco variedades de Sindromes producidos por el uso de las drogas neurolepticas. Tres de ellos aparecen por lo general simultaneamente con la administracion de la droga y dos aparecen tardiamente despues de un tratamiento prolongado durante meses o anos. Su incidencia es aproximadamente 0.2-0.4 % de los pacientes tratados con neurolepticos, siendo mayor en varones con una proporcion 2:145. La existencia de un patron constante de incidencia mas elevada en varones que en mujeres es atribuida a la tendencia de los clinicos a instaurar un tratamiento intenso en varones, debido a que son mas violentos los varones sicoticos que las mujeres enfermas. Los sintomas en el 68 % de los casos aparecen durante la primera semana de tratamiento neuroleptico. El 80% de los pacientes son menores de 40 anos con una edad minima de 20-50 anos, y aun cuando el adulto joven es el paciente tipico, puede aparecer en ancianos y ninos que ingieren neuroleptico accidentalmente. Nos propusimos realizar esta revision bibliografica para comprender mejor las acciones farmacologicas de estos compuestos, que a pesar de ser indicados con frecuencia en pacientes psicoticos y comprobar por la bibliografia revisada que su aparicion no es frecuente, en ocasiones puede ser grave y potencialmente fatal.",

      "abstract": "Introduction First- and second-generation antipsychotics are highly accountable for causing a plethora of medical side effects, ranging from metabolic imbalances to sexual dysfunction (SD), that frequently undermine patient-doctor relationships. Nevertheless, to date antipsychotics are one of the best treatment options for dealing with numerous either acute or chronic conditions like agitation, suicidality, depression, dementia, and of course psychosis. For these reasons, clinicians need to handle them wisely to preserve patients' sexual health, avoid poor therapeutic adherence and prevent high rates of therapy drop-out.Areas covered This article reviews the literature on pharmacologic approaches for management strategies in men who are administered with antipsychotics and developed SD. The etiology of antipsychotic-induced SD is also discussed.Expert opinion Clinicians must consider sexual life as a major health domain. To do so, a first step would be to measure and monitor sexual function by means of psychometric tools. Secondly, primary prevention should be conducted when choosing antipsychotics, i.e. picking sex-sparing compounds like aripiprazole or brexpiprazole. Thirdly, if sexolytic compounds cannot be dismissed, such as first-generation antipsychotics, risperidone, paliperidone, or amisulpride, then aripiprazole 5–20 mg/day adjunctive therapy has proven to be most effective in normalizing prolactin levels and consequently treating antipsychotic-induced SD.",

      "title": "REM sleep behavior disorder - past, present, and future",
      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

Reappearance of seizures may be due to lack of protection and/or an abstinence syndrome. Seizures due to lack of protection occur following withdrawal of any antiepileptic drug when the epilepsy is not cured; they may not reappear for years (although over 80% occur within a year) and treatment then has to be restarted. They seem to be less frequent after withdrawal of carbamazepine or phenytoin than after withdrawing valproate, although the reason for this is not understood. Seizures due to an abstinence syndrome only occur after withdrawing benzodiazepines, phenobarbitone and primidone; they are seen in patients with both active and inactive epilepsy whilst the drug is being withdrawn and tend to be self-limiting. It is not necessary to reintroduce the drug when epilepsy is cured. Felbamate and vigabatrin cause seizures related to their withdrawal, but the mechanism of this is not clear. There is no scientifically established guideline for withdrawing antiepileptic drugs, but it is considered important to stop one at a time, starting with those which may cause abstinence syndromes, followed by the more toxic, less effective antiepileptic drugs, which cause more drug interactions and are more awkward to take.Further specific studies are necessary to establish the mechanisms of relapses and the scientific basis for withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs.",

      "title": "34 Case report of sertraline exacerbation of tics in tourette’s with OCD",
      "abstract": "Introduction Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a prototypical Neuropsychiatric neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic, usually preceding the motor tic, with onset prior to age 18 and of a duration of at least 1 year. 1 2 It is estimated that 50% of TS patients demonstrate OCD behaviours during their lifetime. 3 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI’s) are approved for treatment of depression and for OCD. There are literature reports of the SSRIs, exacerbating or causing tics. However, in all the cases described, symptoms resolved on cessation of Sertraline. We present below a case report of a patient in which this was not the case. Case Report Our patient was a 22-year-old man an unremarkable medical and psychiatric history except mild childhood tics, resolved in adulthood, was referred with a 3-year history of disabling tics (vocal and motor) of sudden onset after using Sertraline prescribed for depression. Three days post Sertraline he began singing his conversation, swearing and suffering from muscle twitches. His symptoms evolved to include: facial tics (masseter spasms, blinking, puffing of his cheek, expelling air through his lips, forehead wrinkling), complex thoracic and upper limb tics (violent head turnings with a hand grabbing motion, shrugging shoulders with violent right arm movements imitating a severe precordial thump, upper limb shaking with spasms and episodes of punching outwards and upper limb flexion with fingers curled as if he is holding an object such as a gun), Lower limb tics (hip gyration, kicking and occasional foot tapping) and vocal tics (simple and complex). Tics were associated with premonitory urge with increased anxiety and intensity on voluntary inhibition. Investigations were unremarkable and included an LP, blood tests with immunological profile, photo stimulation EEG and an MRI. Unsuccessful treatment modalities employed: CBT for twitches (24 sessions) and psychopharmacological interventions (Risperidone, Haloperidol and Quetiapine. Family history was significant for Sertraline intolerance. He was treated with Aripiprazole 2.5 mg for his diagnosis of Gilles la Tourette syndrome with comorbid OCD. Results The subject responded well to Aripiprazole with reduced tic episodes. Conclusion The above case is the only one in the literature to identify a family history of sertraline intolerance and requiring treatment with D2 modulator and a 5HT agonist for tic cessation after tic exacerbation post Sertraline treatment.

      "abstract": "La valeur localisatrice d'un mâchonnement, d'une crispation ou de clonies faciales unilaterales au debut d'une crise partielle est connue. Mais la semiologie critique des autres mouvements buccaux est souvent plus difficile a decrire et a interpreter. Nous rapportons le cas d'une patiente de 38 ans, gauchere, dont les crises se manifestent essentiellement par des mouvements buccaux difficiles a caracteriser (ni un mâchonnement, ni un pourlechage, ni un phenomene moteur elementaire) qui evoquent des dyskinesies bucco-faciales. Elle a presente une meningite a l'âge de 7 mois, des crises d'allure generalisee a 9 ans, puis des crises partielles pluri-quotidiennes depuis l'âge de 24 ans. Ces crises debutent par une sensation de blocage dans la gorge avec blocage du langage, suivie d'une crispation des paupieres, inconstamment des membres superieurs et de mouvements buccaux. L'examen neurologique et les electro-encephalogrammes inter-critiques sont normaux. Les EEG critiques montrent une decharge rapide initiale fronto-centrale gauche. Une origine insulo-operculaire ou proche de l'aire motrice supplementaire a ete evoquee, d'autant que l'imagerie par resonance magnetique encephalique revele un hypersignal dans cette region a gauche. Un test a l'amytal montre une dominance hemispherique droite pour le langage, justifiant la realisation d'une SEEG explorant entre autres l'insula anterieure, la lesion et l'opercule precentral gauches. Ces deux dernieres regions sont le siege d'une activite lesionnelle et irritative. Les crises admettent le meme debut. La stimulation electrique de l'insula anterieure provoque une sensation de gorge serree alors que celle de la region lesionnelle declenche une crise electro-clinique. Les mouvements buccaux complexes de notre patiente apparaissent quand il existe une mise en jeu bipolaire, impliquant simultanement l'AMS et l'opercule precentral. Toutefois leur physiopathologie, notamment l'implication des noyaux gris centraux, reste l'objet de discussions.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

Although the prognosis is thought to be benign, limited long-term follow-up studies exist. This was the objective of our study in addition to exploring the risks of future developmental, behavioral, or neurological abnormalities.Series of consecutive infants with gratification phenomena were identified both retrospectively and prospectively over an eight year period from a single pediatric neurology service. The diagnosis was based on descriptive history, review of videotaped events, lack of neurological or developmental abnormalities, and normal routine electroencephalogram.Nineteen infants were followed for 3-11 years (mean 7.1). Their ages ranged between 4-13 months (mean 7) with 79% females. The diagnosis was not reached by the referring physician and 74% were misdiagnosed as epilepsy or movement disorder. The episodes recurred with variable frequency with gradual reduction in number and increase in length of attack-free periods with advancing age. Complete remission was noted in all patients by age 1-3 years (mean 1.9). However, 4 children (21%) developed features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) on long-term follow up. In this group, the gratification phenomena appeared at a younger age with higher attack frequency.Gratification phenomena in infants are benign and self-limited, often spontaneously disappearing by two years of age. A correlation with future ADHD was found; however, larger prospective studies are needed to further examine this possible association.",

      "title": "Treatment-Resistant Depression in Late Life",
      "abstract": "Depression is the most prevalent functional psychiatric disorder in late life. It is associated with a high risk of mortality from comorbid medical illness and from suicide. Successful antidepressant treatment is one of the most effective ways to reduce disability, prevent morbidity, and improve quality of life in an older depressed patient. Treatment-resistant depression is a common clinical problem, reported to affect up to one-third of older depressed patients. However, published data on this clinically important topic are sparse. Available data and clinical experience indicate that many depressed patients labeled as “treatment resistant” or even “treatment refractory” are so labeled because of variables involving the diagnostic or treatment process, rather than because they suffer from a depression that is truly unresponsive to treatment. Unidentified comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions and misdiagnosis often contribute to treatment resistance. Atypical depressive symptoms, such as somatic and cognitive symptoms, and comorbid medical conditions that can themselves produce depressive symptoms often make it difficult to accurately assess antidepressant response in this age group. This often leads to inadequate pharmacotherapy, another major factor contributing to apparent treatment resistance. In older patients, as in younger patients, the selection of the right antidepressant, the right dose, and the right treatment duration constitute the treatment variables essential in ensuring optimal therapeutic response. Approach to treatment-resistant depression in the elderly involves reconsideration of the diagnosis and use of alternate therapeutic measures in a systematic way, including switching to another agent, combination therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy.",

If male partner aggression persists and escalates, it places the female partner at risk for affective consequences such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, marital discord, physical injury, and suicide.

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Delayed puberty occurs when no signs of pubertal maturation are seen by 14 years of age in boys or 13 years in girls. Although constitutional delay of growth and puberty is commonly seen and is often regarded as benign, there are many other causes of pubertal delay that ultimately result in permanent hypogonadism, and these must be differentiated from self-limited delays in maturation. Causes of hypogonadism include disorders affecting the gonads (primary hypogonadism) and abnormalities of pituitary or hypothalamic function (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may be part of a more global set of pituitary deficiencies or may be the only endocrine axis affected. A rapidly growing array of genetic disorders accounts for isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Treatment of delayed puberty often consists of short-term administration of sex steroids to those with constitutional delay, while individuals with permanent hypogonadism require long-term testosterone or oestradiol replacement.",

In this phase, an explanation and the advice to start moving the neck again gradually after a brief period of rest are sufficient. If this phase is followed by a transition to complaints that can no longer be explained by the physical consequences of the accident, we speak of a chronic postwhiplash syndrome. In such a case there are factors besides the trauma that either induce the complaints or cause them to persist. Unless these factors are eliminated (the biopsychosocial model), the chance of success of any form of treatment is slight. There are indications that therapies directed at aspects of behavioural psychology can make an important contribution to recovery.",

The aim of this review was to examine the prevalence of psychosexual dysfunction associated with antidepressants, and to review treatment options which are specific to the affected component of sexual functioning and antidepressants. Method: Comprehensive literature review using Medline and Cochrane databases. Results: Up to 70% of patients with depression may have sexual dysfunction. Tricyclic antidepressants, selective‐serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine are most and the non‐serotonergic antidepressants and duloxetine least likely to produce sexual dysfunction. Pharmacological treatment options include antidepressants less likely associated or ‘antidotes’ to reverse sexual dysfunction. Conclusion: Sexual dysfunction may be a preventable or treatable side‐effect of antidepressants. Patients need routinely to be asked about sexual function to identify problems early. If sexual dysfunction is ignored it may maintain the depression, compromise treatment outcome and lead to non‐compliance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The withdrawal syndromes after discontinuance of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs, such as chloral and paraldehyde, are all similar. The severity of a withdrawal reaction is largely determined by the daily dose, the duration of administration and the rate of fall of the drug levels after withdrawal, as well as the propensity of the individual patient. The time course of a withdrawal reaction is determined by the drug's clearance. Alcohol has a half‐life of a few hours; withdrawal symptoms may develop within 6–8 hours of abstinence and convulsions in 12–48 hours. After discontinuance of short‐ or medium‐acting barbiturates (half‐life 8–40 hours) symptoms may develop in 1–3 days, followed by convulsions and delirium after 3–8 days. Symptoms and seizures may develop in the 1–10 days after withdrawal of benezodiazepines. In patients with no prior history of epilepsy the types of seizures most commonly induced by drug withdrawal are generalized convulsions, but partial seizures are not uncommon if there is a focal cerebral lesion, or a previous history of partial seizures. Paroxysmal activity and photosensitivity may occur after barbiturate withdrawal in non‐epileptics, more commonly in severe withdrawal reactions. Similar EEG changes may be seen after alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, but photosensitivity does not appear to have been shown to be a feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a relatively common form of psychotic disorder (severe mental illness). Its lifetime prevalence is nearly 1%, its annual incidence is about 10-15 per 100 000, and the average general practitioner cares for 10-20 schizophrenic patients depending on the location and social surroundings of the practice. It is a syndrome with various presentations and a variable, often relapsing, long term course. Although schizophrenia is publicly misconceived as \"split personality,\" the diagnosis has good reliability, even across ages and cultures, though there is no biochemical marker. Onset before the age of 30 is the norm, with men tending to present some four years younger than women. Clues as to aetiology are tantalising, and management remains endearingly clinical. Evidence for a genetic cause grows stronger: up to 50% of identical (monozygotic) twins will share a diagnosis, compared with about 15% of non-identical (dizygotic) twins. The strength of genetic factors varies across families, but some 10% of a patient's first degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) will also be schizophrenic, as will 50% of the children of two schizophrenic parents. Premorbid abnormalities of speech and behaviour may be present during childhood. The role of obstetric complications and viral infection in utero remains unproved. Enlarged ventricles and abnormalities of the temporal lobes are not uncommon findings from computed tomography of the brain. Thus, a picture is emerging of a genetic brain disorder, enhanced or brought out by subtle forms of environmental damage. Symptoms are characterised most usefully as positive or negative, although the traditional diagnostic subcategories (hebephrenic, paranoid, catatonic, and simple) have mixtures of both ### Positive symptoms and signs #### Clinical features suggesting diagnosis of schizophrenia Running commentary on person's actions Two or more voices discussing the person Voices speaking the person's thoughts",

(3) HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE?By applying the criteria described in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), as well as using screening tools in at-risk patients, (1) the primary care physician can establish the diagnosis of major depression.Despite this, it has been shown that more than two-thirds of persons with mental health disorders do not seek help. (4)Barriers to obtaining care include lack of financial means (e.g.having no Medisave accounts), stigma and lack of primary care involvement in the care of persons with mental disorders. (5)As primary care practitioners are accessible and can provide continuity of care and foster long-term relationships with the patient, they are in a unique position to manage depression and should be familiar with the principles and modalities of treatment. WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Be familiar with the principles and modalities of depression managementManagement aims to achieve and maintain remission of symptoms as well as full functional recovery. (6)Treatment should be holistic, based on the biopsychosocial and lifestyle model; (7) this can include medication, psychological treatment (e.g.legitimising the illness and facilitating acceptance of the diagnosis), social treatment (e.g.helping the patient to deal with issues of stigma and discrimination, harnessing resources such as support groups and family members) and lifestyle changes (e.g.identifying and managing stressors, managing comorbidities such as substance misuse), as well as managing concomitant medical illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension.(9) However, the primary care physician should also bear in mind that clinical guidelines serve as a guide and should not replace their own clinical judgment, and treatment should be individualised as much as possible to cater to the patient's best interest.The algorithm in Fig. 1 summarises the approach to the treatment of depression in primary care and the next section describes the various modalities of treatment available in primary care.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

Three studies of SSRI discontinuation were also reviewed.Demographic and treatment information, as well as the timing, duration, number, nature and frequency of dicontinuation symptoms.Paroxetine was most frequently implicated. The drug had been tapered in half of the cases. In some cases, symptom onset began during taper, whereas, in most cases, symptoms began within 1 to 3 days of drug discontinuation. Fifty-three different symptoms were reported, with dizziness being the most common. Other common symptoms were nausea or emesis, fatigue, headache, gait instability and insomnia. Shock-like sensations, paresthesia and visual disturbances were the most rare. Without intervention, symptoms persisted for more than a week in half of the cases. In cases in which the SSRI was restarted, symptoms resolved within 72 hours. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms recurred when the same SSRI was again discontinued.Findings were used to construct diagnostic criteria for the SSRI discontinuation syndrome. These criteria are 2 or more of the following symptoms developing within 1 to 7 days of discontinuation or reduction in dosage of an SSRI after at least 1 month's use, when these symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment and are not due to a general medical condition or recurrence of a mental disorder: dizziness, light-headedness, vertigo or feeling faint; shock-like sensations or paresthesia; anxiety; diarrhea; fatigue; gait instability; headache; insomnia; irritability; nausea or emesis; tremor; and visual disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Nausea and vomiting are reported to occur in up to 62% of terminally ill patients, with 40% experiencing these symptoms in the last six weeks of life. Most of the existing research on antiemetics involves chemotherapy-induced or radiation-induced nausea and vomiting and may not be relevant to the treatment of symptoms resulting from advanced disease. Prospective studies with symptomatology documented at entrance to a palliative care program or hospice care and careful reporting of symptoms and treatment thereafter are needed. There are numerous problems inherent in the study of people with advanced disease. Such patients have a myriad of symptoms interacting with each other and each requiring treatment. Treating one symptom may exacerbate or improve another or cause entirely new problems. Determining whether improvement or exacerbation is part of the disease process, the treatment, or another emerging problem is often very difficult.",

      "abstract": "In the treatment of epileptic children, it is important to give considerations to the child's psychological aspects. One of considerations should be given to the neuropsychological disorders, since it is sometimes observed that learning disabilities coincide with epilepsy. Another consideration should be given to psychiatric disorders. Mental retardation occurs about 20% of epileptic children. Among personality and behavioral problems, hyperactivity is observed in younger children, while a viscous tendency is seen after puberty. The incidence of these two problems is related to the severity of mental retardation. In the course of the treatment of epileptic children, puberty is an important period. It is necessary to assist epileptic children to cope with the disease they have. Although the incidence is small, an acute or chronic epileptic psychosis is observed after puberty. An existence of pseudoseizures should not be forgotten. Cognitive or behavioral problems may occur as a result of anti-epileptic drugs.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Acute psychotic states characterized by clinical lability and dream-like qualities are a staple of classic psychopatology. An excessive focus on diagnostic criteria for bipolar or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders risks missing this particular set of patients; defined through their dynamic presentation as much as by any cluster of symptoms or types of course. Objectives To explore the concept and relevance of oneroid-like cyclic psychosis through a clinical case and review. Methods We report the case of a 37 year old woman with bipolar disorder (three previous instances of manic episodes with psychotic symptoms) and various gynecological issues that required hormone therapy. After a couple of days having difficulty sleeping, the patient developed a clinical picture consisting of wide and sudden oscillations between hyperactive and inhibited psychomotor activity, moods of dread and ecstasy, and states of disorganized thought and childlike activities with perplexity and mutism. Frequent behaviors as if experiencing visual alucinations and repeated allusions to feeling as if in a dream. These symptoms lasted for 2-3 weeks, after treatment with risperidone and lithium. A narrative review concerning the case was also performed. Results Kleist’s ‘innate instability’ permeates much of the previous literature. Similar entities highlight different issues closely related to various biological rhythms: atypical psychosis and epilepsy, puerperal psychosis and estrogen dysregulation, cyclic psychosis and sleep disorders, delirious mania and effectiveness of electro-convulsive-therapy, etc. Conclusions Our findings point to the clinical relevance of oneiroid cyclic psychosis as innate instability. Further studies on the role of biological rhythms and its repercussions on daily practice are required. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Case report: Depression in an older patient with dysgeusia as the initial symptom",
      "abstract": "Introduction Depression is the most common mental illness among older adults, with substantial and persistent mood depression as the main clinical feature, which is unfavorable for improvement. The clinical manifestations can range from melancholy to grief or even numbness. Approximately one-third of older adult patients exhibit physical discomfort as the first symptom; dysgeusia as the first symptom, is very rare in clinical practice. Dysgeusia is a clinical symptom with no specific objective indicator; thus, the likelihood of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis is high. Case presentation In this study, a 60-year-old female housewife with elementary school as her highest level of education, presented to the outpatient department with dysgeusia, poor sleep, and poor mood persisting for &amp;gt;1 year, which aggravated 2 weeks before hospital visit. Psychiatric examination showed clear consciousness; the patient was cleanly and timely dressed and demonstrated self-care but had a worrisome expression. Using the diagnostic criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (10 th edition), a diagnosis of a major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Following pharmacological and psychological treatment, the patient’s condition improved. The patient was compliant to treatment (10 mg/day of escitalopram), had a stable mood, good sleep, and no dysgeusia at &amp;gt;2 years of follow-up as an outpatient. She was able to do housework and take care of her children normally and did not complain about any other issues. Conclusion Physical discomfort is a very common complaint in older patients with depression. If persistent physical symptoms do not improve after repeated medical treatment, timely assessment of the patient’s mental state or psychiatric referral should be considered to diagnose geriatric depression. Timely pharmacological and psychological therapy are the preferred treatment for older adults.",

The sleep disturbance causes significant distress or impairment of functioning.

This often occurs around predictable times of stress or when sleep patterns are disrupted, such as with travel, busy periods at work, illness, or emotional upset. While people may be distressed about sleep loss during acute insomnia, once the trigger factors are removed, sleep usually returns to normal.\n\nInsomnia becomes chronic when someone has difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep for at least three nights a week (not necessarily every night) for at least three months and is distressed by their sleep symptoms. …",

      "title": "The time is now to address behavioral symptoms of dementia",
      "abstract": "A 74-year-old man with mild-stage dementia ets easily agitated if anyone comes to the to help his wife. An 85-year-old woman at the moderate disease stage repeats the same questions over and over. A 90-year-old man in the moderate to severe disease stage tries to leave home undressed. These are just some of the most troublesome behaviors that families and formal caregivers must contend with when caring for a person with dementia. Contrary to popular belief, the memory part of Alzheimer's Disease is only one symptom. Far more troubling to family and other caregivers are the behaviors that accompany cognitive changes, which include agitation, depression, delusional beliefs, repetitive questioning, pacing, hallucinations, aggression (physical and verbal), sleep problems, wandering, and a variety of socially inappropriate behaviors (Lyketsos et al., 2011).While cognitive impairment is the clinical hallmark of dementia, non-cognitive behavioral symptoms are ubiquitous and often dominate the clinical presentation (Sink, Holden, and Yaffe, 2005). These occur across all types and stages of dementia and in almost every patient, affecting 98 percent of individuals at some point in the disease course (Lyketsos et al., 2011). While these symptoms are closely linked to the underlying brain disease causing cognitive symptoms, they also appear to be a consequence of the confluence of multiple, but sometimes modifiable, interacting factors-both internal and external; as cognitive ability declines, there is a heightened vulnerability to the environment that can manifest in behavioral symptoms.As opposed to core cognitive symptoms, the behavioral manifestations of dementia tend to create the most difficulties for individuals with dementia, their caregivers, and healthcare providers. These manifestations are among the most complex, stressful, and costly aspects of care, leading to frequent hospitalizations, early nursing home placement (Kales et al., 2005; Yaffe et al., 2002), and early mortality (Wancata et al., 2003).Recent research also suggests that untreated behavioral symptoms are associated with faster disease progression (Rabins et al., 2011). Thirty percent of care costs for community-dwelling individuals with dementia are directly attributable to the management of behavioral symptoms (Beeri et al., 2002). Because these behaviors are so stressful and difficult for caregivers to manage, they pose threats to caregiver health, employment income (Borson and Raskind, 1997; Clyburn et al., 2000), and quality of life (Van Den Wijngaart, Vernooij-Dassen, and Felling, 2007). Caregivers of individuals with behavioral symptoms are significantly more depressed than those not managing such symptoms (de Vugt et al., 2004). Effective treatments may potentially modify disease course, lower costs, and improve quality of life for individuals with dementia and their caregivers.No National Strategy to Address Behavioral Symptoms of DementiaDementia affects more than 5 million Americans, and that number is projected to grow to as many as 16 million by 2050, in tandem with the aging of our population. Families also are profoundly affected, with more than 15 million family caregivers providing an estimated 17.7 billion hours of unpaid care valued at $220 billon-an amount that is eight times the 2012 total revenue of McDonald's (Alzheimer's Association, 2014). While healthcare spending on dementia (up to $215 billion per year) makes it the country's most expensive healthcare condition (Hurd et al., 2013), current systems of care for people with dementia and their families are like a crazy quilt-random, disorganized, and scattered.Despite the large number of people affected by Alzheimer's and other dementias, and the huge amount of healthcare spending devoted to caring for people with dementia, research funding has lagged behind. In 2013, the NIH spent nearly seven times as much on HIV/AIDs research as it did on Alzheimer's, despite there being five times as many people with Alzheimer's Disease (Campbell, 2013). …",

Male sexual dysfunction (MSD) encompasses disturbances of libido, erectile function, ejaculation, orgasm, and detumescence, and affects up to 10% of middle-aged or older men. Endocrine disorders should be considered in this context, although non-endocrine factors, particularly psychosexual ones, may be more important. Of all hormonal disorders, diabetes mellitus (DM) is, worldwide, the most common and important cause of organic erectile dysfunction (ED), increasing the risk three-fold compared to men without a history of DM. By comparison, male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from subphysiological testosterone levels due to a perturbation of the HPT axis at one or more levels, is a far less common cause of sexual dysfunction.",

Because many physicians do not inquire about sexual dysfunction and patients are reluctant to offer it as a medical complaint, PE is underreported in clinical practice. A sexual history is therefore necessary to uncover the diagnosis. PE can have a significant impact on the quality of life of the patient and his sexual partner, and may lead to psychological distress and loss of self-esteem. It appears that PE has no single etiology, and treatments have been based on both its neurophysiologic and behavioral components. Although no therapies are currently approved for PE by the US Food and Drug Administration, medications that have shown some success include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and topical anesthetics. Behavioral techniques have been the mainstay of PE treatment, and include techniques to decrease sensory input.",

      "abstract": "A seizure (from the Latin sacire, \"to take possession of\") is a transient occurrence of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal brain activity can have various manifestations, ranging from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena not readily discernible by an observer. Although a variety of factors influence the incidence and prevalence of seizures, ~5-10% of the population will have at least one seizure, with the highest incidence occurring in early childhood and late adulthood. The meaning of the term seizure needs to be carefully distinguished from that of epilepsy. Epilepsy describes a condition in which a person has a risk of recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizure, or recurrent seizures due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have epilepsy (although a single seizure associated with particular clinical or electroencephalographic features may establish the diagnosis of epilepsy). Epilepsy refers to a clinical phenomenon rather than a single disease entity, because there are many forms and causes of epilepsy. However, among the many causes of epilepsy there are various epilepsy syndromes in which the clinical and pathologic characteristics are distinctive and suggest a specific underlying etiology. Using the definition of epilepsy as two or more unprovoked seizures, the incidence of epilepsy is ~0.3-0.5% in different populations throughout the world, and the prevalence of epilepsy has been estimated at 5-30 persons per 1000. A standout amongst the most intriguing uses of WSN is wellbeing observing. In this paper we presented a checking framework dependent on WSN for discovery of epilepsy seizures.

The symptoms include reexperiencing of the event with intrusive thoughts or nightmares of the event, startle reactions, psychic numbing, and survival guilt. The application of this concept to chronic illness, often of minor degree, is quite inappropriate. The clinical data in the nine cases reveal no pertinent precipitating event and the lack of a clinical syndrome compatible with the disorder. The cases also generally reflect no psychiatric impairment, inadequate medical review, and lack of background history—common characteristics in asbestos litigation with no disabling pulmonary parenchymal impairment.

      "title": "A Macro Role for Microglia in Poststroke Depression",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Poststroke depression (PSD) is the most common neuropsychiatric sequel of stroke, occurring in one-third of all survivors. Symptoms of PSD begin to appear soon after stroke (peak incidence 3–6 months after stroke) and may persist for up to 3 years. PSD leads to a decrease in quality of life, worse rehabilitation outcomes, slower recovery, higher risk of falls, and higher mortality in survivors.1 A number of clinical and epidemiological factors increase the risk of developing PSD, including older age, female sex, greater disability, and poststroke dementia.1 There is a greater incidence of major depression in elderly adults with stroke than in those with orthopedic lesions, despite comparable disability, suggesting involvement of distinct underlying biological pathways in PSD.1 Biological mechanisms implicated in PSD include altered neurotransmitter levels, degeneration of circuits governing mood and emotions, impaired neurogenesis, dysregulation of brain-derived neurotropic factor, and effects of inflammatory cytokines.2, 3 The neurotransmitter theory, in particular, has attracted considerable attention,3 but most neurotransmitter-based antidepressants have suboptimal efficacy in the treatment of PSD. Similarly, no pharmacological or nonpharmacological preventive treatments have shown efficacy in preventing PSD in stroke survivors.4 It is hypothesized that microglia contribute to the development of PSD and hence might be important therapeutic and/or preventive targets. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the brain and display a nonphagocytic phenotype under normal conditions. Any anoxic, traumatic, or infectious insult to the brain activates microglia, which develop an amoeboid phagocytic phenotype. The activated microglia can subsequently enter a proinflammatory (M1) or antiinflammatory (M2) state, depending on the extent of initial insult and the circulating cytokine profile. Microglia with an M1 phenotype are found to predominate in the brain parenchyma after stroke according to studies in animal models of ischemic stroke.5 Emerging evidence suggests that microglial activation has an important role in the regulation of the brain's response to stress and the development of depression. Human studies show higher microglial density in the brains of individuals who die from suicide. Similarly, mouse studies show dynamic alterations in microglial activation states after exposure to mild chronic stress and learned helplessness models of depression.6 Furthermore, a recent study in rats showed that microglial activation 1 month after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is responsible for the development of post-TBI depression.7 Thus, microglial activation could be a critical mediator in the development of PSD. Depressive symptoms can result from microglial activation through a number of pathways, including microglia-dependent degradation of the serotonin precursor tryptophan, enhancement of glutamate toxicity, greater serotonin uptake by presynaptic terminals, and through dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.6, 7 There is considerable evidence that manipulating microglial activation may be beneficial in various models of depression (Table 1). Minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation, has shown considerable potential as an antidepressant in animal and human models of depression.6 Similarly, a number of antidepressant drugs affect microglial activation, raising the possibility that their antidepressant effects could be mediated, at least in part, through decrease in microglial activation (Table 1). Decrease in interferon-alpha induced pro-depressive behavior in mice Decrease in pro-depressive behaviors in the learned helplessness model of depression in rats Zheng et al., Front Cell Neurosci 2015 Arakawa et al. Pharmacol Biochem Behav 2012 Inhibition of M1-type microglial activation in vitro Decrease in microglial release of glutamate after ischemic insult Studies on conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) also indirectly support the hypothesis that microglial activation underlies some forms of depression.8, 9 Depression in MCI is associated with greater incident risk of AD.8 Similarly, microglial activation in MCI correlates with higher amyloid burden in the brain, suggesting that microglial activation contributes to the conversion of MCI to AD.9 These observations raise the possibility that depression might be a clinical correlate of microglial activation in MCI, which increases the risk of its conversion to AD. Serial correlation studies on microglial activation and depressive symptoms in individuals with MCI will be vital in confirming this hypothesis and could make a case for trials of minocycline in retarding progression to AD in individuals with MCI as well. Recent advances in neuroimaging make it feasible to study the dynamics of microglial activation in vivo. Activated microglia demonstrate greater expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs), and recently developed PBR ligands10 can be used for positron emission tomography (PET)-based serial studies of microglial activation in individuals with stroke or those with MCI. Future studies should use PBR ligand–based PET scans to correlate the dynamics of microglial activation with measures of depression in individuals who survive stroke and those with MCI. This research will provide important clues regarding the pathogenesis underlying PSD and the predictive role of depression in MCI to AD conversion and may also lead to potent prevention or treatment for these disorders, which produce a great deal of suffering in elderly adults.

      "title": "Marital Discord in the Context of a Depressive Episode: Research on Efficacy and Effectiveness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Couples in which one partner is diagnosable as depressed are encountered by virtually every marital therapist. In addition, couples in which one or both partners have significant levels of depressive symptoms are the norm rather than the exception in marital therapy. Similarly, therapists treating depressed clients individually often discover that marital distress is a major influence in many aspects of their clients’ lives. In response to the apparent interconnection of marital discord and adult unipolar depression, the topic of marital therapy for depressed adults has become an important focus of research. Several questions have been partially answered: Do marital problems precede and predict continuation of depressive symptoms or episodes of depression? Does marital therapy for depression produce improvement in couple distress, in depression, or both? Can marital distress be treated while a depressive episode is ongoing or only after it is over? Would a successful individually focused intervention for a depressive episode cause marital stress to disappear? What specific culture, age, and gender features influence the relationship between marital distress and depression? Our goal in the current chapter is to address these and other questions by presenting major findings in the literature to date and by summarizing them into a relatively simple argument as follows. Marital problems are often present for depressed persons; these problems are serious, and they carry unacceptable consequences for those depressed clients who suffer with them.",

Although the human brain has a considerable potential for plasticity, any breakdown in this plasticity may be key to pathogenesis for Alzheimer’s or neurovascular disease. Five to ten percent of the population aged 65 and older show dementia, as does approximately fifty percent of people over 85. For highly accomplished individuals, the first sign of cognitive deterioration is an increase in the time and effort needed to carry out a task. The diagnosis of dementia is based on: 1) a history of persistent and progressive decline; 2) cognitive scores in one or more tests that fall beyond 2 SD’s from age and education-matched ranges; 3) change in scores that exceed 1 SD within a 6-12 month test/retest period; 4) scores below 36 in the Mini-mental State Exam are considered abnormal; 5) patients should be retesting in 12-18 months.

      "abstract": "La comorbilidad de trastornos de ansiedad y TUS es muy frecuente en el campo de la patologia. Ambos trastornos pueden ser primarios, el trastorno de ansiedad puede ser secundario (inducido) al consumo de drogas, o viceversa. El DSM-IV-TR1 describe 12 trastornos de ansiedad y 10 trastornos de ansiedad inducidos. Para poder realizar un adecuado diagnostico y diagnostico diferencial de los trastornos de ansiedad primarios o de los inducidos es necesario que transcurra un tiempo de abstinencia. El DSM-IV-TR senala la necesidad de que transcurran 4 semanas desde el ultimo consumo. Cuando el paciente toma benzodiacepinas de semivida corta o sustancias como la heroina, este tiempo es adecuado, pero cuando consume benzodiacepinas de semivida larga o metadona pueden ser necesarias varias semanas para poder realizar el diagnostico, lo cual no siempre es posible en la practica clinica. Por ello, para establecer un diagnostico diferencial adecuado es necesario realizar una historia clinica completa y valorar los posibles antecedentes personales o familiares de trastornos de ansiedad,indicadores de la existencia de una ansiedad primaria. El trastorno de ansiedad inducido por sustancias incluye aquellas entidades clinicas en las que la ansiedad es de caracter prominente, es decir, las crisis de angustia o las obsesiones o compulsiones predominan en el cuadro clinico. Ademas se debe demostrar que los sintomas aparecen durante la intoxicacion o tras el primer mes de abstinencia y/o que son secundarios al consumo de la sustancia. Los sintomas no deben aparecer en el transcurso de un delirium y deben provocar malestar clinicamente significativo o deterioro social, laboral o de otras areas importantes en la actividad. diagnosticos se cumplen en el curso de una intoxicacion, especificando entonces de inicio durante la intoxicacion, o si se cumplen durante o poco despues de la abstinencia, especificando en este caso de inicio durante la abstinencia. En el DSM-IV-TR no se acepta la existencia del trastorno de ansiedad inducido por nicotina ni por opiaceos. Etiopatogenia Se ha planteado que tanto el uso de sustancias como los trastornos de ansiedad pueden ser primarios o secundarios (inducidos) por lo que la relacion entre el consumo de sustancias y la ansiedad es controvertida. En muchos trabajos esta documentada la coexistencia de ambos pero en ocasiones es muy dificil dilucidar cual de ellos es el primario. Se han propuesto tres hipotesis explicativas sobre la relacion entre ambos trastornos3,4: 1. Los trastornos de ansiedad promueven el uso patologico de alcohol u otras sustancias. Algunos autores proponen que el alcohol u otras sustancias, por sus posibles efectos ansioliticos, pueden ser utilizados por los pacientes como autotratamiento de su ansiedad. En este sentido, tambien es posible que la ansiedad empeore o reactive un consumo de sustancias preexistente. Las evidencias de algunos estudios sugieren que la ansiedad social es un motivo importante para el consumo de alcohol5, ya que mejoraria las expectativas y la creencia de mayor autoeficacia en situaciones de ansiedad social.",

      "title": "Chronic, Unipolar, Treatment-Resistant Mania: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

Perilaku berulang ini umum dilakukan pada masa kanak-kanak yang biasanya dimulai dan berhenti secara spontan. Diketahuinya hubungan kebiasaan buruk oral (bad oral habits) dengan kejadian karies pada anak usia pra sekolah melalui hasil-hasil penelitian. Penelitian ini adalah studi literatur, dengan menganalisis dan menyimpulkan berdasarkan dari penelitian yang sudah ada. Dari hasil yang dihimpun peneliti data yang diperoleh adalah bad oral habits cukup banyak dijumpai pada anak pra sekolah. Dari 5 penelitian tersebut dengan jumlah sampel 4806 anak, sebanyak 1227 anak (25,5%), yang paling banyak dimiliki oleh anak pra-sekolah adalah kebiasaan menggigit kuku/bibir/benda lain. Penyebab dari bad oral habits banyak faktor antara lain stres yang berlebihan, sekedar meniru sehingga menjadi kebiasaan, bosan, lelah, frustasi, tidak senang, tidak aman, atau ketika tertidur lelap, dapat juga terjadi pada anak dengan masalah perkembangan, kesulitan emosional, atau gangguan fisik, harapan orang tua yang tinggi sehingga berakibat pada kecemasan yang akhirnya melampiaskan pada kebiasan buruk tersebut. Dampak yang muncul/terjadi akibat dari bad oral habits adalah adalah maloklusi, gangguan berbicara, perubahan postur wajah, nyeri rahang, gigi abrasi, gigi atrisi, karies gigi, perubahan postur wajah dan gangguan terhadap interaksi sosial mereka terhadap orang lain. Semua bad oral habits memiliki hubungan yang mendukung untuk terjadinya karies, apabila kebiasaan tersebut tidak dicegah dan dihentikan.",

      "title": "Myelomeningocele",
      "abstract": "Abstract Myelomeningocele (MM), a type of spina bifida, is a protruding lesion along the midline of the spinal cord. It arises when the neuroectoderm is transformed into a neural tube and becomes detached from the cutaneous ectoderm. It is the most common malformation resulting from a disturbance in neurotation and occurs when a child is born with a protruding lesion that blocks closure of the neural tube (Fig. 11–1). The defect takes form between 26 and 30 days’ gestation; the later its development, the lower the lesion. Removal of the sac and closure of the neural defect usually are performed within 24 hours of birth to avoid infection. The sac contains meninges, dura, cerebral spinal fluid, and other neural elements. The effects depend on the level of the sac or lesion. The higher the sac, the greater the extent of paralysis. Manifestations range from weakness in the lower extremity to complete paralysis and loss of sensation, and thereby bladder incontinence. Upper extremity fine motor problems are also usually present, although to a lesser degree than lower extremity involvement. Approximately 90% of the children with MM have hydrocephalus, which is not fatal if treated promptly before brain tissue is destroyed. A ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt is used to relieve the pressure3 (Fig. 11–2). The median IQ of children with MM is 88. Even with normal intelligence, many children with MM have a learning disability. Trophic ulcers, spontaneous fractures, and deformities of lower extremities occur because of reduced ambulation. Obesity follows and usually is related to the level of the lesion; higher lesions produce the greatest amount of obesity. Myelomeningocele occurs in about 5 per 10,000 births in the United States and in 6.7 per 10,000 births in Ireland.6 It is found 2.5 times more frequently in whites than in blacks or Asians7 and more frequently in girls than boys in a ratio of 1.25:1.00. Recurrence in families where one child has spina bifida is 2.5 times greater than the incidence in the general population. However, the etiology of MM is unknown. It may involve both environmental and genetic factors. The first-born child is at greatest risk of developing MM.9 With surgical correction of hydrocephalus, removal of the lesion, prevention of renal damage, and provision of aggressive nutrition, orthopedic therapy, and other multidisciplinary therapy, survival may reach 80% to 95% rather than the earlier levels of 50% to 70%.",

      "title": "Paranoid Behaviour in Addison'S Disease",
      "abstract": "A brief review of papers dealing with emotional disturbances associated with Addison's disease is presented. It is pointed out that interest in these disturbances is very recent though the disease has been known for over one hundred years. The evidence suggests, however, that minor disturbances such as apathy, depression, seclusiveness, irritability and negativism are common while major psychoses though rare have been described by a number of authors. These psychoses fall into two groups: those in which the state appears to be a confusional one associated with disturbed electrolyte and carbohydrate balance, and those in which there is no such clear cut relationship. In both types, it now seems to be agreed that cortisone gives superior results to DCA and salt therapy; however, in some cases, cortisone may itself induce psychotic disturbances. A case is then presented of a paranoid reaction in a man of fifty five who had suffered from Addison's disease for ten years and had received DCA and salt therapy during this time. There have been no crises and biochemical changes were not striking. The mental disturbances commenced a year and a half after the onset of the disease and appeared to be running a slowly progressive course. When cortisone treatment was commenced, an interesting change took place and for a time the paranoid reactions alternated with a depressive picture. Finally, after four months of treatment including psychotherapy, the patient made an apparently complete recovery which was maintained over a follow-up period of eight months. Reasons are given for suggesting that the paranoid State represented a total personality reaction, the result of many factors and that psychotherapy and social therapy played an important part in bringing about the satisfactory outcome. The striking benefit received from the cortisone is also emphasized. Finally, it is suggested that, in a disease such as Addison's, which may have such complex repercussions on the life of an individual, the possibility of using psychotherapy and social therapy in addition to the standard medical treatment should always be kept in mind.",

      "abstract": "‘Puzzle pieces falling into place’: experiences with the diagnostic process of developmental disorders or neuropsychological sequelae of an acquired brain injury in adulthood Adults with a (suspected) developmental disorder or neuropsychological symptoms after an acquired brain injury often experience long-term difficulties in various areas of life. Partly due to the less visible symptoms, these diagnoses can stay unnoticed for a long time. This is a problem which developmental disorders and acquired brain injuries have in common. This delay leads to broad psychosocial problems and/or a vulnerable position in society. This study maps the experiences of adults (18 to 65 years) with regard to the diagnosis of a developmental disorder or an acquired brain injury in Flanders (Belgium): 26 adults with one or more recent diagnoses of autism, ADHD, intellectual disability or neuropsychological symptoms after an acquired brain injury were interviewed. Common experiences were searched through an interpretative phenomenological analysis using the software program Nvivo™. The challenges of symptoms prior to receiving a diagnosis are often great. Adults have been looking for answers for a long time. The accessibility of diagnostic services in Flanders is experienced as limited. Primary and secondary care providers play a crucial role in timely referral, but participants experience a shortage of knowledge and expertise among them. For many participants, receiving a diagnosis is the first step in accepting further treatment, although they report a substantial need for a more seamless transition from diagnosis to guidance and advice.",

Apesar de ser uma situacao esperada no final de vida, pode no entanto, ser reversivel ou controlavel em cerca de 25-45% dos casos, pelo que na sua abordagem deve-se ter em conta esta caracteristica, individualizando-se caso a caso, transmitindo a familia a esperanca da reversibilidade. \nNa doenca avancada, o delirio manifesta-se por: perturbacoes cognitivas, disturbios do comportamento psicomotor, com uma instalacao aguda ou subaguda, com flutuacoes durante o dia, agravando-se para a noite, podendo adoptar uma forma hiperactiva (a mais frequente) e uma forma hipoactiva. O delirio, normalmente de etiologia multifactorial, condiciona um conjunto de medidas de intervencao que passam por: terapeutica dirigida a causa, intervencao no comportamento do doente e no ambiente, apoio a familia e o tratamento sintomatico, sobretudo fazendo uso correcto dos varios tipos de neurolepticos, assim como outro tipo de intervencoes farmacologicas.",

      "title": "Demographic Characteristics Among Patients With Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome of the Lower Leg",
      "abstract": "Clinical Scenario: Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) is a condition related with ischemia of the body's tissue due to increases in intracompartmental pressures, which involves, among other symptoms, pain with exertion. CECS is often overlooked or misdiagnosed due to an ambiguous presentation. Diagnostic accuracy of CECS and subsequent management can be improved when contributing factors are known. Research is lacking on the type of patient most likely to experience CECS, highlighting the need for identification of common demographic characteristics among affected individuals. Clinical Question: What are the common demographic characteristics among patients exhibiting CECS of the lower leg? Summary of Key Findings: Four studies were identified (1 prospective consecutive study, 2 retrospective reviews, and 1 retrospective cohort study) that examined common characteristics among patients with CECS. Conflicting evidence exists on whether CECS is more commonly seen in men or in women. CECS has often been reported in young, active individuals but may present in older populations as well. Soccer, field hockey, lacrosse, competitive running, and speed skating have been associated with an increased likelihood of CECS development. Clinical Bottom Line: Current evidence has identified commonalities in sex, age, and sport participation as characteristics often present among individuals experiencing lower leg CECS. Other factors, such as overuse, trauma, diabetes, and gait mechanics, have also been identified in association with CECS. Further data through future prospective studies will help confirm the type of patient mostly likely to experience CECS. Strength of Recommendation: Grade B evidence exists that certain sex, age, and sport participation demographic characteristics are common among patients with CECS of the lower leg.",

      "abstract": "Introduction ADHD is a diagnosis almost always made in childhood or adolescence and oftent difficult to make it new in adults because it is not thought of in the differential diagnosis process and for the lack of experience from adult devices. - ADHD in adults is characterized by symptoms of executive dysfunction, inattention, emotional dysregulation. The symptoms of impulsivity and hyperactivity tend to be less evident. Objectives - Frequently, the adult patient with ADHD comes to the consultation with a secondary symptom and the primary pathology is hidden and often not evident at first glance. Methods - A 20-year-old woman, university student, with no relevant medical or psychiatric history, without toxic habits, who attended her first consultation referred by her primary care physician for long-standing insomnia, restless legs and anxiety. - The patient’s underlying complaint and her bigger concern is her poor academic performance. It is striking that she has just started her third year at the university, the first year she did not pass any subjects, the second year she changed majors and only passed two, now she is repeating the course. - The examination did not reveal overt affective symptoms, nor psychotic symptoms or other notable psychopathology. The patient’s speech tended towards superficiality, inconcretion, it was salty, it was difficult for her to express herself, even suggesting a certain intellectual disability. - In the first consultation sleep study is requested. And referral to clinical psychology consultation for psychometric study. Results - She is administered Clinical interview and WAIS IV (Adult Intelligence Scale), Trail Making Test, d2 and Stroop, Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (inattention items). - The WAIS-IV demonstrated global cognitive abilities within normality, although with significantly lower scores in the IMT and IVP indices which involve the functions of attention, concentration, mental control and short-term visual memory). Trail Making Test, d2, Stroop and Diagnostic Interview of ADHD in adults (inattention items) yielded profile results highly suggestive of Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity. - The insomnia subsided with a regimen of 7.5 mg of mirtazapine per day. Subsequently, after starting treatment with low-dose methylphenidate (20 mg/day), the patient improved very significantly, both academic performance and social functioning and mood, self-esteem and subjective well-being. Conclusions - We must always include ADHD in the differential diagnosis of a young adult patient when faced with a wide variety of consultation symptoms, especially if they report some type of deterioration or dysfunction in their social, family or academic life. - An adequate clinical evaluation supported, if possible, by psychometric tests is essential to reach the diagnosis, which allows establishing an effective treatment that modifies the patient’s overall prognosis.

      "abstract": "Major depression is frequently associated with sexual dysfunction (over 70% of patients), and the antidepressant medications used to treat the illness may exacerbate pre-existing sexual dysfunction, or induce sexual dysfunction not present on diagnosis. In women, sex hormones that change across the life cycle, menstrual cycle, and diurnally have direct effects on sexual functioning, and indirect effects via modulation of neurotransmitter systems. These complex neuroendocrine effects lead to the sexual dysfunction seen with antidepressants. Strategies to manage these effects have had some success. They include switching to antidepressants with minimal sexual side effects, addition of hormones and/or antidotes, and lowering the dose of medication. Emerging data on the pathophysiology of sexual function and dysfunction, and new treatment options may lead to improved quality of life for women diagnosed with depression.",

      "abstract": "Perinatal mental illness influences obstetric outcomes, mother-baby interactions and longer term emotional and cognitive development of the child. Psychiatric disorders have consistently been found to be one of the leading causes of maternal deaths, often through suicide. Postnatal depression and puerperal psychosis are two disorders most commonly associated with the perinatal period. The most efficient strategy to identify patients at risk relies on focussing on clinically vulnerable subgroups: enquiries about depressive symptoms should be made at the usual screening visits. Attention should be paid to any sign of poor self-care, avoidance of eye contact, overactivity or underactivity, or abnormalities in the rate of speech. Particular care should be taken to ask about suicidal ideation and thoughts of harming others, including the baby. One of the most important risk factors is a previous history of depression. The degree of risk is directly correlated with severity of past episodes. Both antenatal and postnatal depression are being increasingly recognised in men. Puerperal psychosis is rare (1 to 2 per 1,000). Sixty per cent of women with puerperal psychosis already have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Women with a personal history of postpartum psychosis or bipolar affective disorder should be considered as high risk for postpartum psychosis. All pregnant women who are identified as being at high risk should have a shared care plan for their late pregnancy and early postnatal psychiatric management. Women with current mood disorder of mild or moderate severity who have a first-degree relative with a history of bipolar disorder or postpartum psychosis should be referred for psychiatric assessment.",

Most of the remainder were suffering from nonaffective disorders; in this group, intermittent depressive symptomatology followed a protacted course (paralleling the underlying disorder) with generally unfavorable outcome. Irrespective of diagnostic subtype, a \"characterological\" component occurring in 24% of the total sample appeared to predict unfavorable prognosis, including three suicides. The diagnostic usage of the concept of neurotic depression may no longer be clinically meaningful, since it lacks sufficient phenomenological characterization and refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders. The data suggest the merits of a biaxial approach to the nosology of depressive disorders whereby phenomenologically based affective diagnoses are qualified as to the presence or absence of character disorder.",

      "abstract": "The goal of treatment of major depression should be full remission. Many patients, however, fail to achieve or maintain symptom-free status. Residual depressive symptoms are common, even where there has been a robust response to antidepressant therapy. In clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients achieve a full remission, one-third experience a response and one-third are nonresponders. Partial remission is characterized by the presence of poorly defined residual symptoms. These symptoms typically include depressed mood, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue and diminished interest or pleasure. It is currently unclear which factors predict partial remission. However, it is clear that residual symptoms are powerful predictors of relapse, with relapse rates 3-6 times higher in patients with residual symptoms than in those who experience full remission. Residual symptoms are also associated with more medical and psychiatric visits, increased public assistance, disability benefits, thoughts of and attempts at suicide and chronicity. The risk of stroke and coronary events is also higher in patients with residual depressive symptoms. The substantial proportion of patients who achieve only partial remission has traditionally been neglected in antidepressant trials. Given that residual symptoms may relate, in part, to an incompatibility between patient and treatment, further research is needed to predict a better match. These symptoms are a clinically relevant state of illness, and the correct choice of initial antidepressant treatment should offer the greatest chance of achieving full remission.",

Their selection is highly competitive, and over the course of their service careers, they experience intensive operational training and combat deployment cycles. Yet, little is known about the health-care needs of this unique population. Method Professional consultations with over 50 special operation forces operators (and many spouses or girlfriends) over the past 6 years created a naturalistic, observational base of knowledge that allowed our team to identify a unique pattern of interrelated medical and behavioral health-care needs. Results We identified a consistent pattern of health-care difficulties within the special operation forces community that we and other special operation forces health-care providers have termed “Operator Syndrome.” This includes interrelated health and functional impairments including traumatic brain injury effects; endocrine dysfunction; sleep disturbance; obstructive sleep apnea; chronic joint/back pain, orthopedic problems, and headaches; substance abuse; depression and suicide; anger; worry, rumination, and stress reactivity; marital, family, and community dysfunction; problems with sexual health and intimacy; being “on guard” or hypervigilant; memory, concentration, and cognitive impairments; vestibular and vision impairments; challenges of the transition from military to civilian life; and common existential issues. Conclusions “Operator Syndrome” may be understood as the natural consequences of an extraordinarily high allostatic load; the accumulation of physiological, neural, and neuroendocrine responses resulting from the prolonged chronic stress; and physical demands of a career with the military special forces. Clinical research and comprehensive, intensive immersion programs are needed to meet the unique needs of this community.",

      "title": "Attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity: a scientific overview",
      "abstract": "According to the American Medical Association, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is “one of the best-researched disorders in medicine, and the overall data on its validity are far more compelling than for most mental disorders and even for many medical conditions” (1). Despite the robust body of research that makes ADHD one of the “best-researched disorders in medicine”, there is still a lack of knowledge about this disorder in Brazil. To address this gap, we present an overview of the current scientific understanding of ADHD.\r\n\r\nADHD is a chronic disorder with onset in childhood that affects approximately 5% of children and adolescents worldwide, irrespective of the country in which they live (2). The disorder persists into early adulthood in approximately 65-75% of cases (3). ADHD has a variable clinical presentation that includes inattentiveness, hyperactivity or impulsivity (4). The symptoms of ADHD cause significant functional impairment, such as social and family life problems, low educational attainment and an increased school dropout risk; this functional impairment frequently leads to low self-esteem and has a negative influence on emotional development (4). ADHD is also associated with negative physical outcomes, such as injuries, including traffic accidents, premature pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases, among others. Individuals with ADHD are also at significant risk of concurrent or future psychiatric comorbidities, such as conduct disorder, anxiety and mood disorders, antisocial behavior and substance abuse (5).\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis is established according to reliable clinical criteria, which require a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that must be maladaptive and inconsistent with the developmental age of the child (6). The symptoms should cause clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. The symptoms must occur often, in more than one setting, and must have persisted for at least six months. Additionally, the diagnosis is only made if at least some of the behavioral symptoms were present before the age of seven years (6). Presently, there are no biological, electrophysiological or neuroimaging markers with clinical utility for the diagnosis of ADHD. Therefore, clinical skills and knowledge are essential for establishing an accurate diagnosis because ADHD symptoms must be differentiated from normal development and other causes must be excluded. In addition, comorbid disorders must be identified.\r\n\r\nEtiological studies evaluating families, adopted children and twins with ADHD have identified a strong genetic contribution, with a pooled heritability rate of 76% (7). Meta-analyses have identified genes involved in the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems, among other systems, as susceptibility genes. Environmental factors, such as intra-uterine exposure to tobacco, prematurity and low birth weight also seem to increase the susceptibility to ADHD (5). Similar to data for other complex diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, the current data for ADHD suggest that multiple risk alleles with small effects and environmental factors are involved in the etiology of ADHD. Emerging evidence also suggests an important role of copy number variations (8).\r\n\r\nNeuropsychological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a clear biological substrate for ADHD, implicating neural systems and areas involved in attention, inhibitory control and other executive functions (9). Many different studies have demonstrated that neural networks in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate, the parietal, striatum, and the cerebellum are primarily involved in ADHD (9,10). In addition, a landmark study conducted by the US National Institute of Mental Health demonstrated a marked delay in brain maturation in children with ADHD, with the peak cortical thickness occurring approximately three years later in children with ADHD than in healthy controls. The delay was most prominent in the prefrontal regions linked to the mechanisms of attention control and executive functions (11).\r\n\r\nMore than 200 randomized controlled trials have evaluated pharmacological, psychosocial and alternative treatments for ADHD (12). Medication results in marked improvements in the cardinal symptoms and is the first-choice treatment for school-age children, adolescents and adults (12). However, behavioral intervention is the first-choice treatment for preschoolers. Stimulants are the first-line medications and have been used to treat ADHD for several decades, with consistent data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of these drugs (13). Stimulants (e.g., methylphenidates and amphetamines) have a pooled effect size of 0.7-1 for children and 0.7-0.9 for adults for the reduction of ADHD symptoms (14,15). Non-stimulants (e.g., atomoxetine and clonidine) have a pooled effect size of 0.6 for children and 0.4 for adults for the same symptoms (12,14).\r\n\r\nDespite the robust ability of medications to reduce ADHD symptoms, there is increasing recognition of the relevance of a comprehensive approach with multimodal interventions that also target the associated conditions, such as school difficulties, family dysfunction, low self-esteem and comorbid disorders (5). It is important to identify the target outcomes to formulate the best treatment plan. For most patients, other interventions of varying type and intensity are needed. The individual's needs dictate which professionals are involved in the treatment and which techniques should be used (13).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, ADHD is an extensively studied disorder, with consistent high-quality data demonstrating its validity. Children and adolescents with ADHD exhibit significant impairment and are at increased risk of deficits in social, emotional and educational development. Although there are concerns about misdiagnosis, which may be related to the small number of well-trained professionals in the field, studies conducted in Brazil indicate that approximately 95% of children with ADHD do not receive treatment (16). The lack of adequate training, stigma, and misconceptions are important barriers to the recognition and treatment of ADHD and must be actively combated.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent literature which suggests that sleep disturbance in members of the general population, whether or not they have ever had a formal psychiatric disorder, is a risk factor for the onset of a formal psychiatric diagnosis at a later time. Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is characterized by chronic subjective dizziness, phobic postural vertigo, and related disorders. For at least 3 months, it exhibits varying symptoms of vertigo, unsteadiness, or dizziness. Methods: Research articles regarding PPPD were searched by viewing the Scopus, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases online. A search strategy using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis was used. Results: It presents a typical chronic vestibular system and brain malfunction that result in persistent dizziness, nonspinning vertigo, and/or unsteadiness. Persistent nonvertiginous dizziness and hypersensitivity to motion and visual stimuli are the main signs and symptoms of PPPD. These symptoms appeared either when there were no active neuro-otologic illnesses or when an episodic vestibular condition was present but could not completely account for the symptoms. Psychological mechanisms that resemble cognitive models of health anxiety and panic disorder are involved in the PPPDs development and maintenance. Conclusion: Since PPPDs diagnostic criteria only involve symptoms, the patient's clinical history is crucial in making the diagnosis. Once diagnosed, effective communication and personalized treatment plans, such as serotonergic medicines, cognitive behavioral therapy, and specialized physical therapy (vestibular rehabilitation), help manage PPPD. Since PPPD is a relatively recent clinical diagnosis, many medical practitioners who treat patients who feel dizzy are unfamiliar with it.",

      "abstract": "Short or tall stature is primarily a normal variation of height. It is part of the continuum of the normal Gaussian distribution curve which defines the lower and upper limit of normal as the 3rd and 97th percentile. Within this context it is very important to differentiate normal variations in height and growth from pathological conditions. Normal variations in height are familial and idiopathic short or tall stature. Normal variations in growth are diagnosed as constitutional acceleration or constitutional delay of growth and puberty and are observed on all percentiles. Patients with pathological conditions of height usually have a syndromal, skeletal or chromosomal disorders such as Russell-Silver or Marfan syndrome, achondroplasia, Ullrich-Turner or Klinefelter syndrome. Many of the disorders with short stature have intrauterine growth retardation. The (mean) final height does not necessarily follow the target height range, but reaches a height below or above the population 3rd or 97th percentile. Patients with pathological conditions of growth can have short, normal or tall stature. They have a reduced or increased growth rate caused by a wide variety of chronic organic or psychosomatic diseases. At present, treatment with growth hormone (GH) is available for patients with GH deficiency, Ullrich-Turner syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, small for gestational age and Prader-Willi syndrome. The indication for GH treatment of idiopathic short stature is so far only approved in the USA. Adult height data indicate that patients with documented GH deficiency reach an adult height within their target height range. For all other indications a statistically significant improvement in adult height has been documented. In the long-term follow-up of these patients not only a statistically significant but also a clinically relevant improvement in adult height should be demonstrated. Depending on the results, some of the indications for GH therapy might have to be reconsidered.",

      "abstract": "The Sexual Tipping Point ® (STP) model is an integrated approach to the etiology, diagnosis and treatment of men with delayed ejaculation (DE), including all subtypes manifesting ejaculatory delay or absence [registered trademark owned by the MAP Educational Fund, a 501(c)(3) public charity]. A single pathogenetic pathway does not exist for sexual disorders generally and that is also true for DE specifically. Men with DE have various bio-psychosocial-behavioral & cultural predisposing, precipitating, maintaining, and contextual factors which trigger, reinforce, or worsen the probability of DE occurring. Regardless of the degree of organic etiology present, DE is exacerbated by insufficient stimulation: an inadequate combination of \"friction and fantasy\". High frequency negative thoughts may neutralize erotic cognitions (fantasy) and subsequently delay, ameliorate, or inhibit ejaculation, while partner stimulation (friction) may prove unsatisfying. Assessment requires a thorough sexual history including inquiry into masturbatory methods. Many men with DE engage in an idiosyncratic masturbatory style, defined as a masturbation technique not easily duplicated by the partner's hand, mouth, or vagina. The clinician's most valuable diagnostic tool is a focused sex history (sex status). Differentiate DE from other sexual problems and review the conditions under which the man can ejaculate. Perceived partner attractiveness, the use of fantasy during sex, anxiety-surrounding coitus and masturbatory patterns require meticulous exploration. Identify important DE causes by juxtaposing an awareness of his cognitions and the sexual stimulation experienced during masturbation, versus a partnered experience. Assist the man in identifying behaviors that enhance immersion in excitation and minimize inhibiting thoughts, in order to reach ejaculation in his preferred manner. Discontinuing, reducing or altering masturbation is often required, which evokes patient resistance. Coaching tips are offered on how to ensure adherence to this suspension, manage resistance and facilitate success. Depending on motivation level, masturbation interruption may be compromised and negotiated. Encourage a man who continues to masturbate to alter style (\"switch hands\") and to approximate the stimulation likely to be experienced with his partner. Success will require most men to be taught to learn bodily movements and fantasies that approximate the thoughts and sensations experienced in masturbation. Fertility issues, as well as patient/partner anger are important causational factors, which often require individual and/or conjoint consultation. Drug treatment would benefit men particularly with severe DE, regardless of concomitant psychosocial-behavioral and cultural complications. When and if a safe effective medication for DE becomes available, this author's transdisciplinary perspective supports appropriate medication use when integrated with counseling. This approach emphasizes the utility of a biopsychosocial-cultural perspective combined with special attention to the patient's narrative. Treatment is patient-centered, holistic and integrates a variety of therapies as needed.",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pain occurs in more than 50% of patients with advanced disease, interferes with daily functioning and quality of life, and is very often undertreated. Patients can find it difficult to articulate the character of their pains, but it is important to determine whether it is somatic, neuropathic, or visceral since this has important implications for management. For most patients with cancer pain, a three-step approach combining simple or opioid analgesia (depending on severity) along with an adjuvant analgesic (depending on cause) will result in good pain relief, but the challenge is to achieve good pain relief without unacceptable adverse effects.",

      "title": "Sexual dysfunction, mental illness and quality of life: a systematic review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction can have a significant effect on quality of life, but is not reported or underdiagnosed. A review of the recent literature highlights the correlation between sexual dysfunction and poor quality of life in people with psychiatric comorbidities and explores several aspects that influence care, from patient follow-up to pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Sexual dysfunction (DS) has been shown to be predominant, but underdiagnosed and often untreated due to communication barriers between patients and physicians. The pharmacogenic and morphogenic causes of sexual problems are often difficult to differentiate. Psychiatric illness may increase the risk of DS, and DS may further aggravate psychiatric problems, suggesting a two-way relationship. Their effective treatment often involves a combination of elements of psychotherapy and behavioral therapies with pharmacotherapeutic interventions, if necessary. The persistence of sexual problems has a significant negative impact on patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment, but also on the patient's quality of life. Routine assessment of sexual function needs to be integrated into ongoing care to identify and address early problems. If sexual dysfunction is ignored, the psychiatric disorder can be maintained, the outcome of treatment can be compromised, and it can lead to non-compliance with treatment schedules.",

      "abstract": "The effects of environmental chemicals, drugs, and physical agents on the developing kidney are influenced by the state of renal development and maturation. The development of the kidney, the major excretory organ after birth, consists of 3 stages: the pronephros, or cervical kidney; mesonephros, or thoracic kidney; and metanephros, or abdominal kidney, the definitive kidney. In humans, nephrogenesis and organogenesis occur from the 6th to the 36th weeks of gestational age. After 36 weeks, nephrogenesis is complete and each kidney has a full complement of nephrons. The extent of chemical-induced renal toxicity is related, in part, to the efficiency in which the particular compound is transported by renal tubules. Because renal tubular transport capacities vary with maturation, the degree of nephrotoxicity may also vary with maturation. The signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity can appear acutely or insidiously. Unexplained acute renal failure, chronic mild proteinuria, or even hypertension can be a manifestation of nephrotoxic agents. Species differences occur, thus the need for studies in humans.",

Es una entidad rara, benigna y autolimitada de causa desconocida y que se diagnostica por exclusion.\r\nSuele aparecer entre la tercera y la cuarta decadas de la vida, pero el rango de edad de los casos reportados va desde los 5 hasta los 52 anos. Solo una minoria de pacientes tiene antecedentes personales o familiares de migrana y se ha reportado un prodromo viral en el 25-40% de los casos. Los deficits neurologicos mas comunes son hemiparesia, hemiparestesia y disfasia (la afectacion del hemisferio izquierdo ha sido reportada mas frecuentemente), siendo los sintomas visuales mas raros. Aunque el deficit suele ser focal, tambien se han reportado manifestaciones difusas como un estado confusional agudo. Usualmente el deficit precede al dolor de cabeza, pero la cefalea puede ser el primer signo de un episodio. Aunque HaNDL es considerado un desorden monofasico, el 75% de los pacientes presentan ataques repetidos que ocurren por semanas e incluso meses despues del episodio inicial y los deficits neurologicos frecuentemente varian entre episodios, involucrando diferentes regiones cerebrales. Los sintomas y signos mejoran paralelamente a la disminucion de pleocitosis en el LCR. En el electroencefalograma realizado durante el periodo sintomatico se ve un enlentecimiento excesivo unilateral, siendo el bilateral menos frecuente; dicha alteracion desaparece tras el episodio sintomatico y no se han reportado alteraciones epileptiformes.\r\nUna vez establecido el diagnostico, el tratamiento es sintomatico y de soporte, junto con educacion sobre el cuadro.

Of 26 patients with paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy, 19 had small cell lung cancer, 4 had breast cancer, and 3 had other neoplasms. There was a striking predominance of females (20:6). Neuropathic symptoms (pain, paresthesia, sensory loss) were asymmetric at onset, with a predilection for the upper limbs; in three patients, symptoms were confined to the arms. Electrophysiologic testing revealed absent sensory responses and normal or minimally altered motor responses. Slightly more than half the patients had associated autonomic, cerebellar, or cerebral abnormalities. In some patients, treatment of the neoplasm seemed to halt progression of the neuronopathy, but none had neurologic improvement and most continued to worsen, even when the oncologic response was good. Distinguishing between paraneoplastic and nonparaneoplastic sensory neuronopathies can be difficult, but prominent neuropathic pain, neurologic dysfunction involving more than the peripheral sensory system, or an increased cerebrospinal fluid protein value should prompt a careful search for a cancer.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of the interventions in preventing the progression of pre-frailty and frailty in older adults: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of the interventions in preventing progression of pre-frailty and frailty in older adults. More specifically, the review questions are: What is the effectiveness of interventions in preventing or reducing frailty in older adults? How does effectiveness vary with degree of frailty? Are there factors that influence the effectiveness of interventions? What is the economic feasibility of interventions for pre-frailty and frailty? Background Frailty is an age-related state of high vulnerability to adverse health outcomes after a stressor event1–6, predisposing the individuals to falls and fractures, disability, dependency, hospitalization and institutional placement, and ultimately death.1 It can be preceded by, but also occurs in the absence of, chronic disease.3,5,7 According to some authors, this clinical condition results from decrease in reserves across multiple physiological systems that are normally responsible for healthy adaptation to stress.1,8,9 Alternatively, it is considered that frailty is due to the critical accumulation of dysregulation in important signaling pathways and subsequent depletion of homeostatic reserve and resiliency.1,10,11 Other authors describe this state of increased vulnerability as associated with a reduced capacity to compensate aging-related molecular and cellular damage.2 Independently of pathophysiological conceptualization, it is assumed that frailty is a dynamic process that leads to a spiraling decline in various functional domains that exacerbates the risk of geriatric syndromes.1,3,5,6 The phenotypic markers of frailty include global weakness with low muscle strength (e.g. poor grip strength), overall slowness (particularly in gait), decreased balance and mobility, fatigability or exhaustion, low physical activity and involuntary weight loss.1,3,5,8 For diagnostic purposes, at least three of these components must be observed.8 The presence of only one or two of them is considered as an indicator of the state of pre-frailty. From a broader perspective, it is assumed that frailty can also manifest through cognitive impairment,12–16 although, according to evidence, the decline in cognition is very selective, being limited to executive functions, attention, verbal fluency and processing of speed. It is also well documented that frail elderlies manifest some impairment in activities of daily living and report significant reduction in quality of life.12,17 Furthermore, recent studies have shown that frailty may be related to mood change,16,18 although the nature of this association, as well as its relevance to the frailty construct, needs to be clarified.17 Regarding the prevalence of frailty, systematic comparison of numerous studies19 shows that frailty in community-dwelling adults aged 65 and over varies from 4% to 17%. In case of pre-frailty, the frequency varies between 19% and 53% in different studies.19 The differences in estimates due to differences in the operational definition of frailty (based on physical markers or incorporating a broader multidimensional approach) and study populations (e.g. the results of epidemiological studies can be affected by demographic variables, such as age and gender, as well as the presence of chronic disease or other comorbid conditions). Because of the frequency of its occurrence and the severity of its consequences, frailty is seen as a threatening condition for older adults, requiring attention from health care professionals, social care practitioners, researchers and policy-makers.3,6,19 The implications of the involvement of these agents can be observed at various levels, with issues related to improving prognosis and preventing the progression from pre-frail to frail being of the greatest interest and relevance. In relations to interventions, attempts to manage adverse consequences of frailty are often focused on minimization of risks of disability and dependency, or on the treatment of underlying conditions and symptoms. For complementary approaches, frailty management involves the development of coping strategies necessary to control potential stress factors or to minimize their impact.3,20 So far, various types of intervention have been proposed, among which are physical activity, psychosocial intervention, health and social care provision, cognitive stimulation, nutrition, medication/medical maintenance and adherence focused interventions, and multifactorial intervention. The results of studies conducted in this area have indicated that treating frailty in older adults is a realistic therapeutic goal.21–24 However, it is still hard to determine how effective these types of intervention are and how efficiency can be influenced by other factors, for example, severity of the clinical condition. Another issue requiring clarification is the effectiveness of interventions in terms of drug prescription and changes in analytical parameters.25,26 The focus of attention should also be directed to economic data, namely, costs relative to benefits and/or savings associated with implementing the interventions for pre-frailty and frailty.27 A preliminary search of the JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Prospero, CINAHL, and Medline has revealed that there are currently no systematic review (neither published nor in progress) on clinical/medical and economic effectiveness of interventions to prevent or reduce frailty in older adults. Therefore, it is necessary for a systematic review to be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the interventions to prevent the progression of pre-frailty and frailty in older adults, involving a critical analysis based on scientific evidence. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include older adults (female and male) aged 65 years and over, explicitly identified as pre-frail or frail by the researchers or associated medical professionals according to a pre-specified scale or index, and who have received health care and support services in any type of setting (primary care, nursing homes, hospitals). This review will exclude studies that: Include participants who have been selected because they have one specific illness Consider people with a terminal diagnosis only. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest The clinical/medical component of the review will consider studies that evaluate any type of interventions to prevent the progression of pre-frailty and frailty in older adults. These interventions will include, but will not be limited to, physical activity, multifactorial intervention, psychosocial intervention, health and social care provision, and cognitive, nutrition or medication/medical maintenance and adherence focused interventions. The economic component of the review will consider studies that have performed any type of health economic analysis of interventions to prevent the progression of pre-frailty and frailty in older adults. The comparator for both clinical/medical and economic components will be implementing usual care, alternative therapeutic interventions or no intervention. Types of outcomes Primary outcomes: Frailty as indicated by any validated scale or measurement or index. Secondary outcomes: Cognition, quality of life, quality-adjusted life year (QALY), activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), caregiver burden, functional capacity, depression, self-perceived health and social engagement, as assessed by any validated scale or measurement or index. Drugs and prescriptions, analytical parameters, falls and fractures, mortality, hospitalization, institutionalization and comorbidities. Costs and/or costs relative to benefits and/or savings associated with implementing the interventions for pre-frailty and frailty. Types of studies The clinical / medical component of the review will consider randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized trials and quasi-experimental studies related to the effectiveness of interventions for pre-frailty and frailty for inclusion. In the absence of RCTs, non-randomized trials, quasi-experimental studies and other research designs of a quantitative nature, such as cohort studies, will be considered for inclusion. The economic component of the review will consider cost effectiveness, cost benefit, cost minimization or cost utility studies. Any quantitative study measuring clinical effectiveness that incorporates economic data will be considered. Studies where the effectiveness of the intervention on frailty measures is not measured will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE via EBSCOhost Web and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by an analysis of text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference lists of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Studies published in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and Dutch will be considered for inclusion in this review. Studies published from 2001 will be considered for inclusion in this review. This timeline was selected because 2001 is the year of publication of Fried's paper8 that showed to be seminal for research on frailty. The databases to be searched include: CINAHL MEDLINE SCOPUS EMBASE Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Scielo. The search for unpublished studies will include: ProQuest Theses and Dissertations OpenGrey Banco de teses da CAPES (www.capes.gov.br) Dissertation Abstracts Online (e-Thos). Initial keywords to be used will be frailty, elder*, old*, intervention* During the process of conducting the search, various terminologies and spellings of the keywords will be taken into consideration as they might affect the identification of relevant studies. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Economic papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Analysis of Cost, Technology and Utilization Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-ACTUARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data extraction Quantitative data will be extracted from papers included in the review independently by two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI (Appendix II). The data extracted will include specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Economic data will be extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-ACTUARI (Appendix II). The data extracted will include specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives. If there is missing information or data that needs clarification, the authors of primary studies will be contacted. Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion or with a third reviewer. Data synthesis Quantitative papers will, where possible, be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using JBI-MAStARI. All results will be subject to double data entry. Effect sizes expressed as odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed statistically using the standard Chi-square. Plausible explanation for variations in treatment effects will be explored using subgroup analyses, whenever possible, based on frailty levels and settings included in the studies. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form including tables and figures to aid in data presentation where appropriate. Economic findings will, where possible, be pooled using JBI-ACTUARI and presented in a tabular summary. Where this is not possible, findings will be presented in narrative form.

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are frequently presented in primary care.1 In about 25–50% of all symptoms presented in primary health care, no support for an underlying physical disease can be found. MUS are a heterogeneous group of symptoms and can involve almost all types of symptoms that patients present to their GP. Functional somatic syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), as well as symptoms stemming from a specific somatic disease that are more severe, more persistent, or limit functioning to a greater extent than expected, based on (objective) disease parameters, are also referred to as MUS. MUS represent a spectrum of severity from mild via moderate to severe, characterised by an increased number and duration of symptoms and functional limitations. Most of the time MUS are transient and self-limiting, but sometimes MUS persist, resulting in extensive investigations and referrals and unnecessary healthcare costs. Therefore, early recognition of MUS is of paramount importance. Although only 2.5% of the patients in general practice meet criteria for persistent or severe MUS (such multiple symptoms that persist for longer than 3 months resulting in severe functional limitations), GPs experience many difficulties in caring for these patients.2 For that reason the Dutch College of General Practitioners decided to publish the evidence-based primary care guideline on MUS, which provides …",

The current case is a 40-year-old female who experienced such orgasms for about a month. Physical examination, investigations, and psychological testing were noncontributory. Carbamazepine (600 mg) was discontinued due to a lack of response. She improved significantly with supportive therapy. Various neuropsychological conditions, pelvic pathology, medications, etc., have been associated with this disorder. Pharmacologic strategies have included the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and analgesics. Validation, psycho-education, identifying triggers, distraction techniques, and pelvic massage have been tried. Living with PGAD is very demanding. There is a lack of understanding of the problem, shame, and hesitation to seek help. The syndrome has been recently described, and understanding is still evolving.",

Such ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ pose a challenge for clinical services that focus on identifying and treating disease. The principles of effective management are to: (a) avoid overinvestigation and giving speculative treatment for disease; (b) take a positive approach with the patient, accepting the reality of the symptoms while explaining clearly that they do not indicate disease; (c) identify and provide treatment for associated depression and anxiety disorders; (d) refer for psychiatric or psychological treatment when required. Complex cases with multiple persistent medically unexplained symptoms are at particular risk of iatrogenic harm and require active multidisciplinary management. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy may be effective.",

      "title": "Epidemiology and natural history of low back pain.",
      "abstract": "Low back pain is a common problem affecting most adults at some point during their lifetime. At any one time, around 1 in 5 adults will report symptoms of low back pain, rising to 40% when asked if they have experienced symptoms during the previous month. The majority of people who experience an episode of low back pain will improve over time. However a sizeable proportion experience repeated episodes or recurrences, and some report continuous symptoms for many years. A wide range of factors are linked to both the onset and persistence of low back pain. Some studies have related age and gender to low back pain, but the link overall is equivocal. Work-related factors such as heavy lifting, and socio-demographic factors such as smoking and obesity have been linked with the onset of low back pain. High levels of functional impairment and the presence of pain radiating to the leg have been cited as factors associated with a poor prognosis among primary care consulters with low back pain. Other characteristics associated with both the development and the persistence of low back pain include psychological factors such as depression and anxiety and workplace factors such as job satisfaction. Low back pain places large demands on health, social and welfare systems. Further research is needed to identify practical interventions to reduce this burden from low back pain.",

These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions.

During this time the patient found himself unable to maintain a 24-h sleep-wake schedule. The lengths of his sleep-wake periods (subjective days) and his sleep periods were highly variable. Nonetheless, there were certain unexpected regularities in his sleep-wake data, corresponding to fixed clock hours. Across the 4-year period, there were certain clock hours during which sleep onset and waking were likely to occur and certain clock hours that may be considered forbidden zones for sleep, during which the patient rarely either began or ended a sleep period. It is possible that the unexpected regularities resulted from partial entrainment to external cues or from some residual influence of an endogenous ultradian-regulating mechanism.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is thought to be a standout amongst the most widely recognized disorder among the women of reproductive age (1).It consists of a series of physical and psychological symptoms that start at the end of the premenstrual period and disappears with the onset of menstrual bleeding or the first few days after menstruation.The prevalence of PMS was estimated to be close to 80% in women of reproductive age (2).Symptoms of PMS include depression, hopelessness, emotional instability, irritability, loss of interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, loss of energy, changes in appetite or excessive desire for food, changes in sleep habits along with physical symptoms such as breast tenderness, headache, feeling bloated and edema (3).The cause of PMS remains unknown and research findings suggest that it is multi-factorial (3).Several factors such as fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone hormones, endocrine disorders and a variety of estrogen receptors, prostaglandin synthesis and environmental factors such as alcohol consumption and stress are involved in its etiology (4).Typically, PMS is a disruptive and often a debilitating factor in the lives of many women (5) in a way that it might disrupt interpersonal relations and daily activities.Moreover, in case of exacerbations, it could affect the lifestyle and well-being of the individual.Behavioral changes made in this period have a noteworthy effect on the performance of families.These effects might lead to child abuse, criminal behavior as well as incompatibility with the spouse and a decrease in the quality of marital relationships (6,7).While men do not experience the effects of premenstrual physical and emotional changes directly, premenstrual changes might affect men by changing the dynamics of relationships (6) which could result in frustration, confusion, and helplessness (8-10).Although the PMS is a serious condition, it has received scant attention so far.Due to the absence of research on the subject and considering the high prevalence of PMS among married women of reproductive age and men's insufficient awareness of the subject along with the impact of this disorder on their lives and marital satisfaction, the need for the present investigation seems evident.The purpose of this study was to determine awareness, attitude, and performance of men regarding PMS among the patients who referred to the selected health centers of Urmia in 2016.",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

There seemed to be no psychiatric symptom-complex common to lipodystrophy, aside from self-consciousness and the tendency to share in the alarm of friends and relatives. Psychiatric symptoms when present seemed on the whole to be psychoneurotic. No constant neurologic symptoms or signs were observed accompanying lipodystrophy. Although weakness is a usual symptom at one stage or another of lipodystrophy, no general symptom-complex or diseases can be considered closely related to it until more cases are available for study. Nervous symptoms in all cases resulting from self-consciousness over personal appearance are not constantly present. No conclusive evidence has been collected to support the theory that the integrity of the nervous system is affected by the disorder.",

Recent data from the REST (RLS Epidemiology, Symptoms, and Treatment) general population study show that symptoms of RLS are present in approximately 7% of the general population, and that 2–3% experience moderate or severe symptoms at least twice a week. Amongst this RLS cohort, approximately 88% reported sensory disturbances and 76% reported sleep‐related symptoms. These symptoms had a marked effect on everyday life, with up to 50% of the RLS cohort reporting disruption of everyday activities or personal relationships. Sleep disturbances in turn lead to impaired daytime functioning. RLS is associated with a significant impairment of quality of life, comparable with that seen in chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or depression. Given the significant burden of morbidity associated with RLS, there is a strong case for treatment in patients with troublesome symptoms.",

      "abstract": "L'algodystrophie ou dystrophie reflexe sympathique est une entite clinique dont la physiopathologie demeure mysterieuse. Cette pathologie survient le plus souvent au decours d'un traumatisme ou d'une intervention chirurgicale. On estime sa prevalence a environ 1/2 000 traumatismes. Le traitement de cette affection est mal codifie et les formes graves responsables de douleurs invalidantes ou de dystonies sont le plus souvent rebelles aux traitements usuels. Deux nouvelles approches therapeutiques de ces formes graves sont proposees par Kemler et al. et par van Hilten et al. \\rLes premiers ont compare sur une periode de 6 mois 54 patients ayant une symptomatologie douloureuse tres invalidante rebelle aux traitements depuis plus de 6 mois, traites par reeducation conventionnelle seule ou associee a une stimulation electrique medullaire. La stimulation medullaire reduit considerablement l'intensite de la douleur et ameliore la qualite de vie de 11 % des patients sans pour autant apporter d'amelioration fonctionnelle nette. Ce type de traitement semble donc etre indique dans les formes tres algiques d'algodystrophie.\\rVan Hilten et al. ont traite 7 femmes atteintes de formes dystoniques multifocales ou generalisees, par un agoniste des recepteurs GABA de type b, le baclofene, en injection intrathecale. En bolus, ce traitement induit chez 6 patientes sur 7 une regression partielle ou complete des dystonies des mains mais n'a que peu d'effet sur les atteintes des membres inferieurs. Administre de facon continue, le baclofene permet de recuperer une fonction normale des mains chez 3 patientes, dont 2 ont aussi retrouve un usage des membres inferieurs permettant la marche. Le baclofene semble aussi agir sur la symptomatologie douloureuse et les retractions des membres inferieurs. Cette etude confirme ce qui etait suspecte : l'implication de circuit neuronaux GABAergiques dans la survenue de ces formes dystoniques d'algodystrophie. L'utilisation de baclofene intrathecal en perfusion continue a deja demontre son innocuite a le long terme dans le traitement des spasticites. Ce traitement semble donc une nouvelle option therapeutique des formes graves dystoniques d'algodystrophies.1. Kemler M.A. 2000.

Symptoms of PMDD occur during the last week of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and usually abate at the onset of menses. About 3–8% of all menstruating women experience PMDD, which can lead to significant functional impairment. Several randomized, controlled trials have assessed the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of PMDD. The SSRIs were found to significantly improve symptoms, particularly psychological or behavioral symptoms, during the luteal phase in women with PMDD. Also, SSRIs were found to improve the quality of life in women with PMDD. Headache, fatigue, insomnia, and anxiety were often reported as adverse effects. A decrease in libido or sexual dysfunction also was reported. In recent studies, intermittent SSRI therapy was found to be effective treatment for PMDD and allows a woman to take the drug for only 14 days each month. Intermittent SSRI therapy should be recommended before continuous daily dosing of SSRIs in the treatment of PMDD.",

      "abstract": "We predicted that the largely female population seeking relief from the incapacitating symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), an enigmatic illness, would feel stigmatized, and that attribution of CFS symptoms to psychological causes by physicians would contribute significantly to the CFS-related stigma. Most subjects scored high on measures of stigma: 95% had feelings of estrangement, 70% believed that others attributed their CFS symptoms to psychological causes, 77% coped by using an educational strategy (disclosure) and 39% saw a need to be secretive about their symptoms in some circumstances. Most subjects (77%) were labeled as 'psychological cases' by one or more of the physicians (mean = 8) consulted, but of the 4 stigma measures, only disclosure was related to physician labeling. Such factors as duration ofw illness and unemployment, dissatisfaction with spouse, and symptom severity correlated significantly with measures of stigma.That many physicians were reportedly ignorant or skeptical of CFS (male more so than female MD's) may influence attempts of CFS patients to legitimize their symptoms by disclosure and lead to high rates of health care system use.",

      "abstract": "Inhibited or retarded ejaculation (RE) is one of the least understood of the male sexual dysfunctions. RE has a relatively low prevalence (&lt;3 %). RE is one of the diminished ejaculatory disorders, which is a subset of male orgasmic disorders. This pathology results in depression, anxiety, lack of sexual confidence. Failure of ejaculation may be a lifelong (primary) of acquired (secondary) problem. In some instances, a somatic condition can cause the disorder of ejaculation. Disruption of sympathetic or somatic innervation has the potential to affect ejaculatory process and orgasm. Usually ejaculation and orgasm occur simultaneously in men. However, the terms of disorder ejaculation and orgasm are not identical according modern ideas about the neurophysiological triggers of these processes. The ejaculatory reflex comprises sensory receptors and areas, afferent pathways, cerebral sensory and motor centers, spinal motor centers and efferent pathways. Neurochemically, the reflex includes a complex interplay between central serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. Cholinergic, adrenergic and oxitocinergic systems play the secondary role. The dominant neurotransmitters are dopamine and serotonin. Currently, there are no effective and safe drugs available to accelerate aculation time. The most effective methods of correcting lifelong RE are psycho - and sex therapy. The best way to treat men with primary RE is to inform them about exiting factors that may retard ejaculation and to instruct them through counselling. The benefit of the therapy depends on the severity of the RE and responsiveness of the patient. Psychotherapy may be useful in some groups, especially in absence of effective or safe drugs. However, the psychological approach to solution of this problem is often disappointing. Further research on the neurophysiological aspects of ejaculation is very important to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of RE and invent the new ways to solve this problem.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "abstract": "Endogenous hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome) usually implies the presence of a pathologic condition caused by either an ACTH-secreting neoplasm or autonomous cortisol secretion from a benign or malignant adrenal neoplasm. However, sustained or intermittent hypercortisolism may also accompany many medical disorders that stimulate physiologic/non-neoplastic activation of the HPA axis (formerly known as pseudo-Cushing's syndrome); these two entities may share indistinguishable clinical and biochemical features. A thorough history and physical examination is often the best (and sometimes only) way to exclude pathologic/neoplastic hypercortisolism. The presence of alcoholism, renal failure, poorly controlled diabetes and severe neuropsychiatric disorders should always raise suspicion that the presence of hypercortisolism may be related to physiologic/non-neoplastic Cushing's syndrome. As late-night salivary cortisol and low-dose dexamethasone suppression have good sensitivity and negative predictive value, normal studies exclude Cushing's syndrome of any form. However, these tests have imperfect specificity and additional testing over time with clinical follow-up is often needed. When there is persistent diagnostic uncertainty, secondary tests such as the DDAVP stimulation test and the dexamethasone-CRH test may provide evidence for the presence or absence of an ACTH-secreting tumor. This review will define and characterize the numerous causes of physiologic/non-neoplastic hypercortisolism and provide a rational clinical and biochemical approach to distinguish it from pathologic/neoplastic hypercortisolism (true Cushing's syndrome).",

Serum creatine kinase (CK) elevation occurs in over 90% of cases. Many diagnostic criteria sets for neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been proposed, all of which include hyperthermia and muscle rigidity as major symptoms, and serum CK elevation as either a major or minor symptom. In general, elevated CK occurs in the initial stage of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and corresponds temporally with the onset of muscle rigidity. However, in some exceptional cases, CK elevation and emergence of muscle rigidity do not appear in the same stage, making early diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome more difficult. Two rare cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are presented in which elevated serum CK and emergence of muscle rigidity did not occur in the same stage of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. An elevated CK level is common in the early stage of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, suggesting that serum CK elevation is a useful indicator for early detection of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, a definitive diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be determined from the presence of specific clinical symptoms.",

On behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Complementary and Integrative Medicine\n\nNocturnal enuresis (NE) is characterized by the involuntary discharge of urine at night in those 5 years of age or older. Primary NE (PNE) is diagnosed in an individual who has never achieved nighttime dryness; in secondary NE (SNE), incontinence follows a dry period of at least 6 months. In either, the enuresis must not be due exclusively to a medical condition or diuretic therapy. Prevalence is estimated at 5% to 10% among 5-year-olds, 3% to 5% among 10-year-olds, and 1% among those 15 years of age and older. Between 5% and 10% of cases resolve annually without treatment. (1) The causes of PNE and SNE remain unclear, although physical, neurologic, and psychological factors; genetics; sleep structure; and other medical conditions have been implicated. (2)\n\nTreatment for NE includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options, and many families are interested in complementary and integrative approaches. This review assesses the efficacy and safety of acupuncture/acupressure, hypnosis, and biofeedback in treating NE.\n\nOriginally developed as a health-care tool in China thousands of years ago, the stimulation of specific points on the body (called acupoints) may be carried out by a variety of techniques, including insertion of thin needles (acupuncture), surface pressure (acupressure), electricity (electro-acupuncture), and laser (laser acupuncture). The effect of acupuncture on PNE was assessed through two recent systematic reviews. (3)(4) The Cochrane review summarized the results of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). (5)(6)(7)\n\nIn the first study, 111 patients ages 5 to 15 years were assigned randomly to two different forms of acupuncture.

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

      "abstract": "Thirty-five EEG patterns of grand mal seizures recorded under some conditions such as awake-rest, sleep activation, beme-gride activation and intermittent photic stimulation were studied in 31 epileptics and four non-epileptics. Preictal EEG's were generally variable in comparison with ictal EEG's. It was not till 10 sec before seizures that the incidence of seizure discharges changed in most all cases, of which six increased and four decreased. A paroxysmal extreme varied EEG abnormality often continued for several to several ten sec immediately before a tonic phase, associated with some clinical symptoms. EEG patterns of the “preconvulsive phase” were divided into six types with different clinical features. In most all cases of bamegride activation, poly-spike and wave discharges preceded on seizure activities and some of them related with absence or psychomotor epilepsies. In all cases of sleep activation and photic stimulation, high voltage slow bursts or poly spikes preceded. Seizure patterns recorded at awake-rest were indefinite. A few cases didn't show any preconvulsive EEG changes, and were closely related with grand mal epilepsies. While the grand mal seizure during sleep had a long tonic-clonic convulsive phase and a short pre- and postconvulsive phase, that induced by bemegride activation showed the opposite findings. The grand mal seizure at awake-rest had the middle tendency between the two. The differences among the effects of various recording conditions on seizure patterns present some suggestions as to the patho-physiological mechanism of epileptic seizures.",

More recently, animals have been incorporated into a number of “animal-assisted interventions”, including animal-assisted activities, animal assisted-therapy, and service animal programs. The most common forms of animal-assisted interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions involve dogs or horses, often described as canine or equine therapy (or hippotherapy), respectively.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder; GAD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) are common mental health conditions associated with disability, decreased quality of life, increased mortality, and economic burden.– PTSD is a persistent mental health condition that may occur in individuals who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, such as exposure to death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence. GAD, which is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 40 Canadians aged 15 years and older per year, is characterized by persistent and excessive fear, worry, and feelings of being overwhelmed. Finally, symptoms of MDD (also known as clinical depression or major depression) include sadness, insomnia, loss of interest in hobbies, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. A formal diagnosis of MDD requires the persistence of symptoms over a period of at least two weeks. Treatment strategies for PTSD, GAD, and MDD often include clinical care with pharmacologic agents (e.g., antidepressants), psychotherapy, or a combination of both approaches.The objective of the current report is to summarize and appraise the available evidence on the clinical effectiveness of canine therapy and equine therapy versus other forms of psychotherapy for the treatment of individuals with PTSD, GAD, MDD. This report compliments a 2012 CADTH Rapid Response Report on the use of therapy dogs and horses for patients with mental health conditions.",

Its criteria are: tolerance, withdrawal effects, lack of control, reductions in other activities, impaired psychological, social or physical functioning. For primary ED, the physical activity is an end in itself; for secondary ED, motivation is extrinsic--to control or alter body mass and shape. Estimates of the prevalence of ED range from 2-3% to 20-30%. Hypotheses of ED development concentrate on beta-endorphin, sympathetic arousal, affect regulation or some psychological explanations (e.g., exercise as distractor).",

All patients had abnormalities in at least one of the electrophysiological parameters. The sensory potentials were the most sensitive indicator of subclinical involvement; abnormalities were found in 24 patients, 12 of whom had no sensory symptoms or signs and five of whom had no other clinical or electrophysiological evidence of neuropathy in the upper extremities. This indicates that sensory nerve fibres may be affected before motor. The next most sensitive parameter was the presence of fibrillation potentials, found in more than half the distal muscles examined. Slowing in motor conduction in the lateral popliteal nerve was the only electrophysiological change correlated to the severity of the neuropathy, and no other electrophysiological parameter was correlated to the duration or the severity of the neuropathy or the diabetes. An onset of neuropathy before or simultaneously with the manifestations of the diabetes, as well as the frequent occurrence of asymptomatic changes in sensory conduction, support the evidence at hand that the neuropathy develops concomitantly with and as an integral part of the metabolic disturbance rather than as a consequence of the vascular complications of diabetes. Of three patients with clinical signs or symptoms of a diabetic amyotrophy, two had asymptomatic electrophysiological abnormalities in distal nerves and muscles, consistent with widespread involvement of the peripheral nerves. The third patient had electromyographic changes in the medial vastus muscles suggestive of a myopathy. Motor and sensory conduction in distal and proximal nerves were normal.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is significantly higher among patients with epilepsy than the general population. Moreover, the profile of depressive disorder is often atypical in patients with epilepsy. Data from human and animal studies have tended to point towards a bidirectional link in the pathophysiological basis of both epilepsy and depressive syndrome. Depressive symptoms in epilepsy can be divided into those occurring in the peri-ictal period (pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal), and those occurring in the inter-ictal period. Peri-ictal depressive disorders are particularly associated with temporal lobe epilepsies. These include: (i) peri-ictal dysphoria, (symptoms occur in the 24 hour period preceding a seizure); (ii) ictal depression, (symptoms develop during the seizure); (iii) post-ictal depression, (symptoms occur in the 72 hours following the seizure). The inter-ictal depressive disorders are not temporally related to seizures. The best characterized of these is ‘‘inter-ictal dysphoric disorder’’. This includes labile depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anergia, pain, insomnia), labile affective symptoms (panic-like symptoms and anxiety), and supposedly ‘‘specific’’ symptoms (paroxysmal irritability and instable-euphoric moods). Standard psychiatric classification may be inadequate to describe some of the atypical profiles seen in this patient population. Depression in patients with epilepsy is therefore under-diagnosed, and yet contributes to poorer quality of life, epilepsy outcome and risk of suicide. It is recommended that an appropriate screening tool be used to detect signs of major depression, the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E). Clinicians should recognize the characteristics of peri-ictal and inter-ictal depressive syndromes. 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

It affects adult patients usually over 50 years old and is treated with low-dose oral corticosteroids. In this case, a 68-year-old female with a history of PMR, diagnosed by a specialist sporadically seen in the past, presented to a primary care physician due to herpes zoster (HZ) infection. Thorough history taking, along with a careful review of previous laboratory results, raised serious doubts concerning her diagnosis (PMR). Because the patient described diffuse pain throughout her body, sleep disturbances and a depressed emotional state, fibromyalgia was suspected instead and appropriate treatment was given. The patient remained free of symptoms and corticosteroids for almost a year. Information from this case may help to point out that PMR is a disorder that can be easily confused with other chronic pain conditions with similar manifestations, especially when the initial diagnosis is sped up in terms of consultation depth and care continuity. Under certain circumstances, primary care can lead to improved clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The development of psychotropic chemotherapy with widespread use in the psychiatric clinic for its anxiolytic, hypnotic, antidepressant, psychostimulant or psycho-destructive sedative effects has given rise to a new pathology secondary to increased abuse and accessibility. Their neurotropism is generally exerted on the central nervous system at the level of the complex meso-diencephalo-striate structures, influencing the elementary psychic functions, but also the activity of the whole organism through the neuro-humoral system. The clinical investigation of the patient must be interdisciplinary in nature, as human beings are characterized by a bio-psycho-social unit, in which the various biological and psychological components, influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the social environment, are involved in a special way, which gives an original personality to everyone. There are five fundamental axes, which are usually evaluated: thinking, memory, attention, emotion and behavior. A disorder in any of these axes, intense enough to interrupt the normal activity in more than one operating field over a sufficiently long period of time, is diagnosable as a mental disorder. There is an indication borrowed from internal medicine regarding the acute character (weeks), subacute character (months) and chronic character (years), which is attached to the diagnosis. A small part of the entire psychiatric population suffers from severe conditions, which involve intermittent episodes of severe disinhibition, aggressive behavior and self- or hetero-directed violence. In most cases, we talk about conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders (panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder), which do not make him a social predator, although they cause enormous suffering to the individual. This study includes 67 patients with mental illness. While conducting the study, we took into account that the first contact with the patient is essential for the results of the anamnesis, oral examination, risk assessment and provisional treatment plan. In the 67 cases there were performed mycological analyses. It is necessary that dentists have certain knowledge of psychology and psychopathology, in order to understand the mechanism of psychopathological reactions and avoid them.",

De igual modo, tambien se ha relacionado esta sintomatologia con sindromes que necesariamente no conllevan un intento de suicidio como son el uso y abuso de sustancias, el autismo o la esquizofrenia. En este sentido, estas conductas autolesivas han sido planteadas como con causa de necesidad afectiva o llamada de atencion. El presente trabajo valida una herramienta para el diagnostico y posterior tratamiento de estas autolesiones sin intencion suicida. Los datos arrojan que existen dos subdimensiones de la autolesion: Autolesion por encima de la piel y Autolesion por debajo de la piel. Existen igualmente diferencias de genero entre hombres y mujeres tanto en el tipo de autolesion como en el nivel de la misma. EnglishSelf - injury behaviors have been related to different syndromes of anxiety, depression, attempted suicide and consummate suicide, bullying, and physical and/or sexual abuse. Similarly, this symptomatology has also been linked to syndromes that do not necessarily lead to an attempted suicide such as substance use and abuse, autism or schizophrenia. In this sense, these self - injury behaviors have been related to affective or attention need. The present study validates a questionnaire for the diagnosis, and subsequent treatment, of these self - injuries without suicidal intent. The results show that there are two sub - dimensions of self - injury: Self - injury above the skin and Self - injury below the skin. There are also gender differences between men and women in both the type of self - harm and in the level of it.",

Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Results: PPPD is a frequent entity that has been only recently well described. Diagnosis relies on anamnesis; posturography is helpful. High scores of depression, neuroticism and introversion may be a risk factor for PPPD. 25% of cases may be triggered by neurotologic events such as Vestibular migraine, which is more prevalent than Meniere's disease. There are alterations in activity and connectivity in the key central vestibular, visual and anxiety systems. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and especially Sertraline could be the medication of choice. Other SSRI or Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) may be chosen in case of comorbid psychiatric disorders or insufficient response to the first choice medication. Cognitive behavioural therapy, vestibular and balance rehabilitation therapy seem to be effective. Conclusion: PPPD seems to stem from a multi-sensory maladjustment. Symptoms of Vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease and PPPD are often overlapping, stressing the need for more precise diagnostic tools. Cognitive behavioural therapy and vestibular rehabilitation therapy have been recently proved to be effective therapeutic options for PPPD. However, there is little progress done concerning drug-treatments: SSRI and SNRI may help, but there is a need for larger controlled double-blind trials to confirm the effectiveness.",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

Depressie heeft een slechtere prognose als er tegelijkertijd een lichamelijke ziekte bestaat, en het beloop van somatische aandoening is ongunstiger bij mensen met een depressie. Bijna driekwart van de patienten met een depressie en een chronische lichamelijke aandoening waren niet als depressief gediagnosticeerd door hun huisarts, zoals blijkt uit het ontbreken van een geregistreerde diagnose depressie in hun medisch dossiers. Depressieve, lichamelijke zieke patienten die daarbij ook nog een andere psychische stoornis hadden (meestal een angststoornis) werden vaker als depressief gediagnosticeerd door hun huisarts (37%) dan de lichamelijke zieke patienten die alleen depressief waren (16%). Huisartsen gaven enige vorm van zorg bij nieuw ontstane depressie bij een patient met een chronische somatische aandoening in 86% van de gevallen. Patienten met een ischemische hartaandoening of hartritmestoornis hadden minder kans op enige vorm van depressiezorg (in vergelijking met patienten zonder chronische lichamelijke ziekte). Meestal werd door de huisarts begonnen met behandeling met antidepressiva. Het hebben van een (specifieke) lichamelijke aandoening had geen invloed op de kans dat antidepressiva continu werden voorgeschreven gedurende tenminste zes maanden. Er is behoorlijk wat ruimte voor verbetering van de diagnostiek en behandeling van comorbide depressie bij chronische lichamelijke ziekte in de huisartsenpraktijk. (aut. ref.)",

There are, however, replicated findings of clinical characteristics that are more common in both bipolar I depression and unipolar depressive disorder, respectively, or which are observed in unipolar‐depressed patients who ‘convert’ (i.e., who later develop hypo/manic symptoms) to bipolar disorder over time. The following features are more common in bipolar I depression (or in unipolar ‘converters’ to bipolar disorder): ‘atypical’ depressive features such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis; psychomotor retardation; psychotic features, and/or pathological guilt; and lability of mood. Furthermore, bipolar‐depressed patients are more likely to have an earlier age of onset of their first depressive episode, to have more prior episodes of depression, to have shorter depressive episodes, and to have a family history of bipolar disorder. The following features are more common in unipolar depressive disorder: initial insomnia/reduced sleep; appetite, and/or weight loss; normal or increased activity levels; somatic complaints; later age of onset of first depressive episode; prolonged episodes; and no family history of bipolar disorder. Conclusions: Rather than proposing a categorical diagnostic distinction between bipolar depression and major depressive disorder, we would recommend a ‘probabilistic’ (or likelihood) approach. While there is no ‘point of rarity’ between the two presentations, there is, rather, a differential likelihood of experiencing the above symptoms and signs of depression. A table outlining draft proposed operationalized criteria for such an approach is provided. The specific details of such a probabilistic approach need to be further explored. For example, to be useful, any diagnostic innovation should inform treatment choices.",

Such depression and anxiety can last several months and even a year and may be accompanied by symptoms such as frequent weeping with apparently no external or internal reason, lethargy, having no motivation to carry daily tasks, sleeping too much or too little, increased or reduced appetite, and diminished interest in social events. Internet forums and blogs can serve as a good source of emotional support. Women use them much more frequently than men, and they report using these forums mainly to get empathy, warmth, understanding, sense of belonging, and to share their feelings.

Restless arms syndrome (RAS) predominantly affects the arms, while the legs are rarely affected. RAS appears to be very rare, with very few cases described to date, but the diagnosis of RAS is probably made too infrequently, especially for milder and transient forms. The patient reported here even had severe symptoms for years that could have indicated RAS. He observed an immediate improvement in all RAS-related symptoms after administration of 100 mg L-dopa +25 mg benserazide, which continues to this day. Clinicians should always be alert for RLS-like symptoms in one or both arms that worsen at rest and improve with movement, thinking of possible RAS.",

      "abstract": "In 48 cases of claims of psychic injury due to exposure to asbestos, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was alleged as a basis for damages in nine (19%). PTSD as currently defined refers to a specific syndrome following exposure to a life-threatening traumatic event, one outside the general range of people's experiences such as military combat, floods, earthquakes, bombing, torture, death camps--events either natural or man-made. The symptoms include reexperiencing of the event with intrusive thoughts or nightmares of the event, startle reactions, psychic numbing, and survival guilt. The application of this concept to chronic illness, often of minor degree, is quite inappropriate. The clinical data in the nine cases reveal no pertinent precipitating event and the lack of a clinical syndrome compatible with the disorder. The cases also generally reflect no psychiatric impairment, inadequate medical review, and lack of background history--common characteristics in asbestos litigation with no disabling pulmonary parenchymal impairment. If the results in this group are typical, then one must suspect the legitimacy of claims of psychic injury such as post-traumatic stress disorder from asbestos exposure and at the very least the reasonableness of the experts who provide input into the medicolegal process.",

We therefore reviewed all cases of pure autopsy-proven AD in the Ramsey Brain Bank to determine how frequently an abnormal gait was noted at time of presentation. Any reported gait disturbance was considered an abnormal gait. Only cases for which medical records were available documenting the patient's presentation for dementia were included. Cases were excluded if any other pathology was present that may have contributed to the patient's dementia or to a gait disorder, if neuroleptic medication had been used, or if there was a preexisting gait disorder. Clinical dementia severity at time of presentation was graded as mild, moderate, or severe per DSM-IIIR criteria. Of the 95 cases that met study criteria, none of the 36 patients with mild dementia were reported to have had an abnormal gait. Sixteen percent of the patients with moderate and 32% with severe dementia had gait abnormalities reported. This study confirms the statement regarding gait in the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.",

These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions.

A condition with identical symptoms, known as secondary mania, generally occurs in isolation in older adults and has an identifiable organic etiology. Here, we report a 57-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a 3 weeks history of sudden onset mania with psychotic symptoms. He had no previous psychiatric history, and his presentation coincided with the initiation of a course of steroids. Despite the absence of physical symptoms, investigations revealed a previously undetected adrenocorticotropic hormone-releasing small cell lung carcinoma that led to his death within months. This case highlights the complexity of distinguishing primary from secondary mania when it occurs after the peak incidence period of early adulthood. Undertaking a comprehensive medical workup is generally recommended.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Women suffering from severe primary dysmenorrhea (PD) show a typical behaviour pattern characterized by flight, avoidance, inactivity and helplessness. The question is if there is a common mechanism of origin in all those individual women who display such PD behaviour. A learning-theoretical model is presented concerning the origin of the connection between the stimulus of menstruation and the response of PD behaviour in women with severe PD: — Women have an increased physiological arousal premenstrually and during menstruation. — Women have a tendency to label the increased arousal negatively for two reasons: (1) Because of negative attitudes towards menstruation acquired from the social environment. (2) Because women have a lack of knowledge about their genitals and their functions, there is a lack of correct labelling of menstruation. Inexplicable arousal is mostly labelled as something “wrong”. — The negatively labelled increased arousal pre- and intermenstrually leads to an increased receptivity for conditioning. — The increased receptivity for conditioning means an increased proneness to react with a specific response to a certain stimulus, i. e. with PD behaviour as a response to the stimulus of menstruation. — Premenstrually highly anxious women are more receptive to conditioning than women who are not anxious premenstrually. The experience of PD makes the woman anticipate menstruation with anxiety, which thus forms the basis of a vicious circle. The validity of this theoretical model needs to be tested in experimental research.",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

The risk of being depressed is greatest for women during their reproductive years and thus clinicians may encounter a pregnant woman with preexisting depression or a woman who becomes depressed during her pregnancy. As with many psychiatric disorders, the pathophysiology of a depressive disorder is unknown, although evidence suggests that underlying risk is determined by biology, stress, and trauma. There are nine candidate symptoms of a major depressive episode (MDE): depressed mood, diminished interest, significant weight change, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, decreased concentration, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. The management of a pregnant woman with an MDE will vary depending upon whether she has unipolar or bipolar illness. Women with MDE who suffer from bipolar disorder will require treatment with a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J.

Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D.

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.).

Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M.

Staff play an important role in the improvement of depressive symptoms in the cancer patient. Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

      "abstract": "1. IntroductionA lot many factors are available which contribute to this avoidable adventure. Out of these few which are highly relevant have been lineated as follows. Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

In Malaysia, psychiatric disorders were responsible for 8.6% of the total Disability Adjusted Life Years and were ranked fourth as the leading cause of burden of disease by disease categories1. More and more evidence shows that physical illnesses are strongly associated with psychiatric disorders. Those with physical illnesses have much higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders compared to that without2-3. The mechanisms of co-morbidity of psychiatric and physical illness are complex. It is a two-way interaction and there are five different possible ways to describe this4-5. Co-incidence or By-chance In clinical practice, the psychiatric illness may be coincidental and unrelated to physical problems, as both physical and psychiatric conditions are common in the general population. Such disorders do, however, complicate the management of the physical illness. For example, depression can predate the onset of the medical illness in up to 25% of patients with co morbid depression, and it is associated with an increase in somatic complaints5. Common cause for both Here, either patient factors or non-disease factors may have given rise to both; for example, stressful life events in a vulnerable person may precipitate both a stroke and a depressive illness6.",

In these instances, clinicians can investigate other signs and symptoms that may indicate bipolar disorder, including family history, onset, irritability, hypersomnia, weight gain, and comorbid anxiety or substance abuse, among others. A patient with depression who exhibits any of these characteristics cannot be definitively diagnosed with bipolar depression, but these signs should indicate to the clinician that bipolarity is a possibility and further investigation is warranted.

One might argue that the seven eponymous syndromes of the DSM (Alzheimer's, Asperger's, Creutzfeld-Jakob's, Huntington's, Pick's, Rett's, and Gilles de la Tourette's) require a bit of study before their nature is clarified, but all the others either stem from common English roots (gambling, binge-eating, sleep disorder) or are decipherable from their Greek or Latin origins (trichotillomania: pathological pulling of hair; insomnia: absence of sleep, etc.). Borderline, when used adjectivally, suggests something that is in close proximity to something else. Indeed, in its first uses in psychiatry, borderline designated either (a) a condition that approximated another, already well-established disorder, or (b) a condition that occupied a region in between two rather indistinctly boundaried levels of mental functioning. As we shall see, the borderline of our current BPD is derived from both these usages.",

      "title": "Bruxism Decoded: A Case Report Revealing the Invisible Signs",
      "abstract": "Bruxism is characterized by involuntary movements involving teeth grinding or clenching. It is perceived as a parafunctional activity, and it can lead to instability and various consequences such as dental wear, musculoskeletal pain, masseter hypertrophy, persistent fatigue, and tension headaches. According to the time of occurrence, it can be classified as awake bruxism and/or sleep bruxism. This case report describes a 19-year-old woman, who presented to her family doctor with shoulder pain, headaches, and persistent tiredness despite apparent adequate sleep. She reported no other symptoms and denied any trauma or physical exertion. Her past medical history included anxiety disorder, treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and irregular follow-ups with psychology and psychiatry throughout the years. The only relevant findings on the physical examination were cervical and shoulder tenderness, without functional impairment, along with noticeable wear on dental surfaces, consistent with bruxism. Further history of overall behaviour was compatible with both sleep and awake bruxism, exacerbated during periods of increased anxiety. The SSRI dose was increased, and a muscle relaxant was prescribed. A referral was made to both psychology and dentistry. After two weeks, a reduction in anxiety, headaches, and musculoskeletal pain was observed, with only sporadic use of the muscle relaxant. A dental splint was prescribed following dental evaluation, resulting in significant clinical improvement: better anxiety control, improved sleep quality, occasional musculoskeletal complaints, and reduced headaches. Although the patient did not initially complain of bruxism, the presence of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity with repetitive contractions and increased muscle tension highlighted the need to identify this condition as a clinical target for intervention and treatment. Early diagnosis is essential to minimize complications and prevent symptom dispersion. Otherwise, bruxism may be overlooked as a central diagnosis, and treatment opportunities may be missed. Given its multifactorial aetiology, management must be multidisciplinary, as demonstrated in this case.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE) belongs to the group of epilepsies with primarily generalized seizures as absence epilepsies, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, as well as infantile and juvenile idiopathic epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

Results: Eight patients were included in the presented case series. The average age of onset of this distinct headache condition is 57 years. All patients were either perimenopausal or in menopause when the headaches started. The syndrome is marked by bilateral head pain that starts daily from onset and is typically at its most severe intensity the first thing in the morning before arising or when in the supine position. Immediate worsening in Trendelenburg appears to be an almost diagnostic test for the syndrome and occurred in all patients. The majority of the patients had a history of episodic migraine, but the migraines were either very well controlled or had ceased by the time the new headache arose. The bulk of the patients (6/8) were either overweight or obese, although two patients were of normal body mass index (BMI). Neuroimaging showed no abnormalities. All patients responded to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure-/volume-lowering medications (acetazolamide or spironolactone), but only one patient was able to completely taper off treatment without headache recurrence. Conclusion: This newly defined subtype of chronic daily headache appears to be caused by a state of elevated CSF pressure. It is hypothesized that a combination of an elevated BMI and the presence of cerebral venous insufficiency leads to this form of daily headache.",

      "abstract": "Muscle cramp is characterized by involuntary, painful, visible contraction of a muscle (or a part of muscle) and is always associated with irregular repetitive firing of motor unit action potentials (200 à 300 Hz) which is caused by hyperexcitability of intramuscular terminal motor axons. It's a common condition in normal people, but most commonly in young people (pregnancy, exercise) and more in the elderly (50% after 65 years-old). A careful history and examination should allow the physician to determine the significance of cramp. ENMG and biological tests are needed in cases of severe symptoms (severity and frequency of cramps) and/or abnormal examination. Idiopathic and secondary (drug or metabolic disorders) cramps are the most common groups, but it's very important to search the motor unit diseases (neuropathy, radiculopathy, plexopathy, neuromyotonia, and a cramp fasciculation syndrome which can preceded ALS). The first goal in management of cramp is to determine if there is an underlying cause and the second to use physical measures (stretching), because, pharmacologic treatments have a moderate interest because of the potential of toxicity (quinine sulfate) or a little effectiveness (vitamin B complex, naftidrofuryl, and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem, gabapentin). Isolated cramp doesn't need treatment.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background : Miller Fisher Syndrome usually presents with complete ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia. We present an unusual case which presented with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. Case presentation : A 51 year old female patient presented with a history of difficulty in walking and double vision for 1 week which started 2 weeks following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. She didn’t have any bladder bowel incontinence or difficulty in breathing. On examination there was left side abducens nerve palsy and bilateral significant dysmetria. Upper limb and lower limb power was 4/5 with global areflexia. There was no fatigability or sensory deficit. Higher cortical functions were intact with Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Brain stem cerebro vascular accident, alcohol, toxin or drug mediated disease, myasthenia gravis, Bickerstaff encephalitis and Miller-Fisher syndrome were considered as possible differential diagnosis. There was no history of alcohol consumption or any exposure to drugs or toxins. Her Non contrast brain and MRI brain were normal. Nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical sensory motor and F wave abnormalities consistent with a Guillen-Barre Sydrome variant. Cerebro Spinal Fluid analysis showed albumino-cytological dissociation. These findings suggested the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher Syndrome. She was started on plasmaphareis. Her vital parameters, vital capacity and neurological deficit were closely monitored. With 5 cycles of plasmapharesis she made a complete neurological recovery and she was discharged on 16th day of admission. Conclusion: Miller Fisher Syndrome can present as unilateral abducens nerve palsy and early diagnosis and treatment leads to excellent functional outcome.",

      "title": "ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SILEXAN IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY ANXIETY SYNDROMES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Anxiety and depressive diseases represent leading causes of burden worldwide with a globally increasing prevalence and suffering [1]. Although the heterogeneous clinical presentations do not always fully meet the criteria required for a diagnosis of a full-blown psychiatric disease as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the so-called “subthreshold” or “subsyndromal” severity consistently showed a long-term negative impact on general health, life quality and functionality, and hence a decreased working capability in the affected individuals [2, 3]. For both, subsyndromal as well as full-blown manifestations, beneficial clinical effects on anxious, depressive, psychosomatic and cognitive symptoms and favorable safety profile lacking pharmacological interactions, undesirable sedation, withdrawal symptoms, or abuse potential were repeatedly confirmed for Silexan in patients with primary anxiety syndromes [4, 5]. Additionally, in-vitro studies indicated stimulation of synaptic plasticity, and in rats repeated administration of Silexan decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test [6]. Aims &amp; Objectives Based on the available clinical and preclinical international evidence, the pharmacological profile suggests that Silexan, a proprietary active substance produced from Lavandula angustifolia Miller flowers that has been approved in many countries for the oral treatment of anxiety disorders, may also have an antidepressant effect [6]. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on data from placebo- controlled clinical trials with Silexan at a daily dose of 80 mg [7]. Methods The present meta-analysis investigating comorbid depressive symptoms was conducted based on five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials performed with Silexan in subthreshold anxiety (n = 3) and generalized anxiety disorders (n = 2) [7]. Results The results of the item depressed mood assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale clearly showed that Silexan has a beneficial effect on co-occurring depressive symptoms in these patients [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 315 patients suffering from mixed anxiety and depressive disorder [7]. Silexan was significantly superior to placebo regarding the antidepressant efficacy measured with the Montgomery Å sberg Depression Rating Scale as well as the anxiolytic efficacy measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [7]. Discussion &amp; Conclusion Based on these encouraging results and the need for an antidepressant agent with a beneficial efficacy and tolerability profile lacking unfavorable pharmacological interactions or withdrawal symptoms harming the quality of life, especially in patients with milder forms of depression [4, 7, 8], the antidepressant efficacy of Silexan is currently being investigated in an international randomized placebo-and reference-controlled phase III trial in patients with a mild to moderate major depressive episode (EudraCT Number: 2020-000688-22).

      "title": "Emotional Aspects of Hyperprolactinemia",
      "abstract": "Patients with hyperprolactinemia often present with emotional difficulties. These occasionally persist even after successful treatment. Insight into the roots of their diseased state makes a difference in the handling of all cases, but becomes crucial in the not-so-rare situations in which the normalization of hormonal levels is not followed by a feeling of cure. This chapter attempts to provide details, discuss and situate in context the following blocks of pertinent information: (1) prolactin acts upon the central nervous system and variations in its concentrations do affect mood, emotions and behavior; (2) most actions of prolactin are directed to metabolical and behavioral adaptation to pregnancy and the care of the young; (3) even in the absence of pregnancy prolactin secretion responds to environmental stimuli under specific conditions. Whether adaptive, as in the case of surrogate maternity, or pathological, as in the case of pseudopregnancy, prolactin responds to a perceived need to take care of a child; (4) the facts that the clinical onset of prolactinomas often follows life-events and that these tumors occur preferentially in women brought up under specific conditions suggest the possibility that psychological factors may predispose to prolactinomas; (5) dealing with individual cases requires the perception that the relations between prolactin, emotions and feelings are circular, i.e., prolactin affects the brain and mood but, on the other hand, personality traits and environmental factors may stimulate the secretion of prolactin and may play a role in the genesis of the disease.",

Impulse control disorders refer to behaviors involving repetitive, excessive, and compulsive activities driven by an intense desire. Both OS and impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) may be side effects of dopamine agonists. At present, there are only a few case reports and studies related to PD with concomitant OS and impulse control disorders.We describe a 70-year-old male patient with PD, OS, and impulse control disorders, who presented with a six-month history of the delusional belief that his wife was having an affair with someone. He began to show an obvious increase in libido presenting as frequent masturbation. He had been diagnosed with PD ten years earlier and had no past psychiatric history. In his fourth year of PD, he engaged in binge eating, which lasted approximately one year. Both OS and hypersexuality were alleviated substantially after a reduction of his pramipexole dosage and a prescription of quetiapine.Given its potential for severe consequences, OS should be identified early, especially in patients undergoing treatment with dopamine agonists.",

      "title": "Psychosocial and socioeconomic burden of vasomotor symptoms in menopause: A comprehensive review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many women experience vasomotor symptoms at or around the time of menopause. Hot flushes and night sweats are considered primary menopausal symptoms that may also be associated with sleep and mood disturbances, as well as decreased cognitive function. All of these symptoms may lead to social impairment and work-related difficulties that significantly decrease overall quality of life. Hot flushes have shown a great deal of variability in their frequency and severity in women. In some women, hot flushes persist for several months; in others, they may last for more than 10 years. Traditionally vasomotor symptoms were reported to begin 5 to 10 years prior to the cessation of the final menstrual cycle, corresponding with the initial decline in circulating gonadal hormones; however, night sweats in particular most often begin in perimenopause. The pathogenesis of hot flushes has not yet been fully elucidated, but the circuitry involving estrogen and neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and serotonin specifically, are hypothesized to play a major role in the altered homeostatic thermoregulatory mechanisms underlying these events. Menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms are associated with significant direct and indirect costs. Overall costs of traditional pharmacotherapy or complementary and alternative medicine modalities, including over-the-counter treatments and dietary supplements, for managing menopause-related vasomotor symptoms are substantial and include initial and follow-up physician visits and telephone calls. Additional costs include laboratory testing, management of adverse events, loss of productivity at work, and personal and miscellaneous costs. Pharmacoeconomic analyses, including those that consider risks identified by the Women's Health Initiative, generally support the cost-effectiveness of hormonal therapy for menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms, which have been the mainstay for the management of these symptoms for more than 50 years. However, because many women now want to avoid hormone therapy, there is a need for additional targeted therapies, validated by results from controlled clinical trials that are safe, efficacious, cost-effective, and well tolerated by symptomatic menopausal women.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "title": "Frontal lobe seizures",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This video teaching course presents several patterns of frontal lobe seizures recorded in a number of Italian Epilepsy Centers. The general features of frontal lobe seizures are outlined in the introduction. Sixteen vldeo‐EEG sequences involving 10 different patients are shown. A short presentation of the clinical history precedes each case report. The electroclinical characteristics of seizures implicating the frontal lobe are extremely variable. According to the literature, general characteristics allowing differentiation between seizures of different topography include: appearance of seizures in clusters; seizures predominantly nocturnal or while the patient is falling asleep; short duration of each episode (approximately 30 s); abrupt onset and end; relatively short post‐ictal phase, when present; frequent secondary generalization and falls; frequent subjective sensations, usually difficult to describe; impairment of consciousness is not a constant feature; episodes of status are frequent; differentiation from pseudo‐seizures may prove to be difficult. When confirmation of the epileptic nature of paroxysmal phenomena is needed, video‐EEG recordings may be of some help. Possible subjective manifestations are: cephalic and neuro‐vegetative (even epigastric) manifestations, as well as “pensée forcée” , fear, olfactory hallucinations, non‐lateralized visual disturbances. Motor manifestations include tonic, dystonic, postural, oculocephalic deviations and falls. Verbal and more often gestural automatisms can be complex, very brief and often violent, but elementary automatisms, such as automatic hand and mouth movements, or bimanual and pedaling movements, are also frequent. In this video teaching course, we first present seizures featuring minimal motor signs, followed by seizures with a more complex semiology. The most significant clinical and EEG features are discussed. (Published with videosequences.)",

      "title": "Compulsive Sexual Behaviors in a Young Male with Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behaviours are relatively rare and are not known to be associated with social phobias, with an intense scientific debate on going if it constitutes a behavioral addiction. Compulsive sexual behaviours otherwise known as Hypersexuality/problematic sexual behaviour and is identified by a persistent pattern of failure to control repetitive, intense urges, fantasies and behaviours of a sexual nature over an extended period of time that causes marked impairment in multiple areas of functioning, in this case, especially educational functioning. Phobic anxiety disorders also known as social phobias are a group of conditions in which anxiety is triggered typically in well-defined situations that are not currently dangerous with resulting avoidance of such situations. Nevertheless, CSB is not captured in DSM V and ICD10, although, diagnostic criteria were proposed during DSM V revision, it is not currently recognized in the DSMV. Although, CSB has been proposed for inclusion in ICD 11 as an impulse control disorder, rather than as a mental and behavioural disorder as previously debated, in addition, strict diagnostic guidelines were instituted due to concerns of over pathologizing sexual behaviours. This presents a diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the psychiatrist when a patient presents with symptoms of Compulsive sexual behaviours with or without anxiety, since there are presently no diagnostic and treatment guidelines. We present the case of a 23 year old 3rd year medical student with a 5 year history of compulsive masturbation, persistent pornography viewing, failure to resist impulses and fantasies with accompanying intense distress especially following periods of abstinence and a two year history of recurrent panic attacks in social settings in which women were triggers complicated by depressive symptoms, symptoms significantly impaired most areas of functioning particularly his academics.\r\n\r\n A diagnosis of Social Phobia/Social Anxiety disorder with episodic panic attacks and compulsive sexual behaviours and mild depressive episode was made because patient met criteria according to ICD 10 and proposed ICD 11. Mental state examination shows anxious mood, congruent with affect, depersonalization, derealization as well as anxious ruminations. Within a year, after commencement of an SSRI, Atenolol and Lisonopril and CBT all anxiety symptoms resolved with marked reduction in the frequency of pornography viewing as well as compulsive masturbation with associated fantasies. This case report lends voice to the on-going debate about the inclusion of compulsive sexual behaviours as a mental and behavioural disorder Dependence syndrome in diagnostic classification systems as well as the need for development of standardized appropriate treatment modalities. This case report will highlight Compulsive Sexual Behaviours, rationale for its inclusion as an addiction in classification systems and treatment approaches to the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The perimenstrual period is associated with increased psychiatric disturbances of both neurotic and psychotic nature. Menstrual psychotic disorder (MPD) is an uncommon condition, not universally accepted within the classifications of functional psychosis; its symptoms are not included under actual definitions of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The MPD diagnosis requires specific features and excludes acute menstrual-related exacerbations of chronic mental conditions and menstrual mood-disorders. Case description We present the prospective case study of a 24-year-old Chinese woman recently arrived in France following marriage, who was admitted on three occasions to an inpatient psychiatric service for symptoms of acute recurrent psychosis developed with the onset of menstrual flow. Each episode was characterized by acute onset with the menstrual bleeding, short duration with full recovery few days after. Pharmacotherapy was instaurated from the first episode (risperidone and other coadjuvant drugs). Discussions This case illustrates the complexity of diagnosis in a person with recurrent presentation of psychotic symptoms associated with menses. In most of the MPD case-reports in literature, no serious psychosocial stress factor was mentioned; the use of psychotropic drugs was also considered inconclusive, successful treatment with hormone therapy being reported in several situations. Although pre-existing psychiatric conditions may exacerbate in the perimenstrual period, the relationship between typical functional psychoses and MPD, and the phenomenology of this disorder needs to be clarified; case-studies may contribute to the recognition of MPD as a specific disease entity.",

      "title": "HYSTERICAL PSYCHOSIS",
      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

      "title": "OP.02 Restless legs, periodic limb movements and breathing problems",
      "abstract": "Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: ▶disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, ▶excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and ▶things that disturb the individual9s sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society. Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically ▶insufficient sleep, ▶interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and ▶intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3–4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.",

EpA of different intensity and pattern could be retained for more than three weeks. Hyperactive basomedial nuclei played the role of a primary pathological determinant which caused the complex of emotional and behavioural disorders. Continuous motor depression at the early stages alternated pathologically enhanced activity at the later stages. A number of signs could be considered as the evidence of the affective disorders (motivation suppression, enhanced irritation, anxious excitation). Stereotype behaviour, immobility, rigidity, different types of vegetative disorders (ptosis, constipation, piloerection, loss of weight, respiratory arrhythmia, dystrophic symptoms) were observed in most animals. The emotional, behavioural and vegetative disorders described are compared to the manifestations of the depressive syndrome.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

Ein immer groesserer Anteil von Unfallopfern beklagt psychische Beschwerden, wobei die Zunahme kein isoliertes Unfallphaenomen ist, sondern sich allgemein in der Bevoelkerung wiederfindet. Die Ursache, weshalb Unfallfolgen psychischer Art haeufig zu Rechtsstreitigkeiten fuehren, liegen darin, dass psychische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden und mitunter kaum zu objektivieren sind. Diese Ausgangslage erfordert zunaechst, dass zwischen einem seelischen Primaerschaden und einem seelischen Folgeschaden zu unterscheiden ist.

Der Schaediger kann sich nicht auf eine seelische Labilitaet des Betroffenen berufen. Fuer nicht unmittelbar Beteiligte ist der Gesundheitsschaden dem Schaediger nicht zuzurechnen.

No hay ningun sintoma que por si solo sea patognomonico de la esquizofrenia. Los sintomas caracteristicos de la enfermedad se clasifican en positivos, negativos (o deficit) y desorganizacion. Se estima que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia a lo largo de la vida esta entre el 0.7 y el 1.5%. Afecta de forma similar a ambos sexos. Esta enfermedad es habitualmente de tipo cronico y puede caracterizarse por tres fases (fase aguda, fase de estabilizacion y fase estable) que se fusionan unas con otras sin que existan unos limites claros y absolutos entre ellas. El tratamiento farmacologico es necesario, pero para tener una respuesta eficaz hay que combatir tambien con diversos problemas de indole social, psicoeducacion, tecnicas sociales y de afrontamiento y rehabilitacion, en una red de salud mental formada por equipos interdisciplinares.

There are no symptoms that alone are pathognomonic for schizophrenia. The characteristic symptoms of the disease are classified as positive, negative (or deficit) and disorganization. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.5%. It affects both sexes in a similar way. This disease is usually chronic in nature and can be characterized by three phases (acute phase, stabilization phase and stable phase) that merge with each other without there being any clear and absolute limits between them. Pharmacological treatment is necessary, but in order to have an effective response, it is also necessary to combat various problems of a social nature, psychoeducation, social techniques and coping and rehabilitation, in a mental health network made up of interdisciplinary teams.",

      "title": "LMNB1-Related Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LMNB1-related autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive disorder of central nervous system white matter characterized by onset of autonomic dysfunction in the fourth to fifth decade, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar abnormalities resulting in spasticity, ataxia, and tremor. Autonomic dysfunction can include bladder dysfunction, constipation, postural hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and (less often) impaired sweating. Pyramidal signs are often more prominent in the lower extremities (e.g., spastic weakness, hypertonia, clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs). Cerebellar signs typically appear at the same time as the pyramidal signs and include gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and nystagmus. Many individuals have sensory deficits starting in the lower limbs. Pseudobulbar palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and forced crying and laughing may appear in the seventh or eighth decade. Although cognitive function is usually preserved or only mildly impaired early in the disease course, dementia and psychiatric manifestations can occur as late manifestations. Affected individuals may survive for decades after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNB1-related ADLD is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and MRI findings and either an LMNB1 duplication or (more rarely) a heterozygous deletion upstream of the LMNB1 promoter identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. For autonomic dysfunction: Neurogenic bladder may require management of urinary retention and/or urgency and recurrent urinary tract infection. Constipation may require good hydration, increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and/or laxatives. Orthostatic hypotension can be minimized by pharmacologic intervention, compression stockings, physical therapy, and increased dietary salt. Erectile dysfunction is treated medically. Impaired sweating is managed with cool environment and attention to fever during infection. Spasticity may be treated with medications and physical therapy. Ataxia can be managed with strategies to minimize falls and increase strength, and adaptive equipment such as walkers or wheelchairs. Feeding difficulties can be managed with speech therapy and appropriate feeding interventions to assure adequate nutrition while preventing aspiration pneumonia. Surveillance: Routine assessment of: weight, nutrition, and feeding; pulmonary status (re possible recurrent pneumonia); bladder and erectile function; psychosocial well-being; and medications/doses to avoid iatrogenic polypharmacy. At least yearly assessment: by a neurologist for disease manifestations and progression; and by a physiatrist, orthopedist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist to address orthopedic, equipment, and functional needs. Genetic counseling LMNB1-related ADLD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all individuals diagnosed with LMNB1-related ADLD whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a large LMNB1 duplication (or a deletion upstream of LMNB1) inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with LMNB1-related ADLD has a 50% chance of inheriting the LMNB1 duplication (or deletion upstream of LMNB1). Once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for LMNB1-related ADLD are possible.",

Anabolic-androgenic steroids, synthetic progestins, and antiepileptics are the most frequently implicated drugs in hyperandrogenism. The mechanisms of androgen excess are various: (1) intrinsic androgenic activity of the drug, (2) interaction with sex hormone-binding globulin, or (3) functional alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovary axis. Nevertheless, the physiology of these drugs remains generally unclear. Such is the case for valproate, which seems to induce a form of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by increasing ovarian androgen synthesis. It should be remembered that it is always necessary to rule out other causes of androgen excess, especially an ovarian or adrenal tumor or PCOS, before attributing the symptom(s) to a drug.",

      "abstract": "There may be a strong underlying wish to return to primary narcissism, with accompanying hopelessness and unconscious shame. When shame is avoided, pathological narcissism, counterfeit behaviour, hostility or violence may result. A move by a patient into a merged state with the therapist may, therefore, signal anxiety due to the presence of unconscious shame. The way that the therapist deals with the projected shame may be crucial to the outcome of the therapy. The situation may become an intractable \"shame-guilt cycle\" in which there is a repetition-compulsion, without insight, of an unconscious sado-masochistic relationship in the transference and countertransference. Defences against shame are manifestations of a wish to hide from oneself or from the seeing other. Whatever the sequence of cause and effect, shame and sexuality are closely associated. Shame undoubtedly plays a part in many, if not all, psychological disturbances and may be the most important factor in some.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy for Treatment-Resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling illness affecting approximately 2%-3% individuals worldwide that is marked by recurrent, distressing intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). 1,2 The underlying pathophysiology is incompletely understood, but OCD symptoms are thought to emerge partly from aberrant functionality in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical neural circuits. 3 Though OCD is a major cause of functional disability and impairment, 4 the only medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs, ie, the selective SRIs [SSRIs] and clomipramine). 5 Extensive evidence supports that SRIs are effective for treating OCD symptoms, and with a favorable side effect profile relative to clomipramine, SSRIs are currently the first-line pharmacotherapy. 6However, around half of patients will respond incompletely to SSRIs, 7 and at least 8 weeks of sustained treatment are typically needed before meaningful clinical improvement is seen. 6SSRI treatment is associated with dose-dependent side effects including gastrointestinal upset and sexual dysfunction, which may be particularly problematic given that patients with OCD tend to require treatment with higher doses to achieve symptomatic relief compared to those with anxiety and depressive disorders. 8 When patients do not respond to or cannot tolerate SSRIs, the evidence supports several next steps.Here, I briefly review options for pharmacologic management of treatmentresistant OCD, summarizing the evidence supporting each.What constitutes \"responsiveness\" to OCD treatment remains controversial, though improvement from baseline of 25%-35% on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale is a commonly used definition.Experts similarly disagree on the definition of \"treatment resistance, \" but have generally quantified it based on the number of failed treatment trials. 9A comprehensive review of this topic, including a review of psychotherapeutic and somatic treatment approaches, is beyond the scope of this article; for more detailed discussions, see references 6, 9, 10, and 11.",

      "title": "Depression During Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "The author of this article uses a case vignette to highlight issues related to the occurrence and management of depression in pregnancy. The case subject was a 24-year-old married pregnant woman with a history of depression who presented at 10 weeks of gestation with a 1-month history of symptoms strongly suggestive of recurrent depression. After an attempt of suicide 2 years before this pregnancy, she had been successfully treated with a short course of sertraline. She was not currently suicidal and wanted to continue the pregnancy. The author describes management options for this patient, discussing issues pertinent to diagnosis and treatment of major depression. Major depression is a common and treatable mental disorder affecting more than 12% of pregnant women. The natural course of major depression is variable in both pregnant and nonpregnant women. Over time, depression may become more severe or resistant to treatment. The likelihood of self-harm or suicide is difficult to predict and is a major consideration. A history of depression is the strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy. Physicians or other health care providers should ask all pregnant women or women considering pregnancy about a personal or family history of mental disorders and treatment. Any woman with symptoms suggestive of depression should undergo a complete evaluation. Untreated depression during pregnancy has been associated with increased risks of suicide, miscarriage, and preterm birth as well as poor fetal growth and impaired fetal and postnatal development. Multidisciplinary care is recommended, with involvement of the patient's obstetrician, primary care physicians, and mental health professionals. Valid choices for management include an antidepressant, cognitive behavioral therapy, and/or interpersonal psychotherapy. No safety data are available from randomized controlled trials of antidepressants during pregnancy, but observational data suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as sertraline, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are relatively safe during pregnancy, although they have been associated with fetal anomalies (particularly cardiac), miscarriage, preterm birth, and persistent neonatal pulmonary hypertension. Both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors appear to be safer than tricyclic antidepressants. Given the previous response of the patient in the case vignette to sertraline, the author recommends using sertraline as initial treatment, with careful assessment for suicidality and side effects. Close monitoring throughout pregnancy and the first postpartum year is necessary because of the increased risk for postpartum depression.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

      "title": "Sexual Behavior, Function and Satisfaction in Headache Associated with Sexual Activity: A Systematic Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Headache associated with sexual activity (HSA) is the painful event of head and neck precipitated only by sexual activity. The negative impact of sexuality is expected to be more severe in HSA patients and their partners than other headache disorder. In addition, social and cultural taboo may conceal sexual problem or hinder seeking counseling for sexual perplexity. A sufficient scientific evidence is therefore needed to clarify the misunderstanding and schedule appropriate education in clinical practice. Methods: A systematic review of literature was completed to elucidate the sexual behavior, function and satisfaction in HSA patients and their partners. Results: A total of 97 publications are eligible after careful screening. However, most of the studies focus on the etiopathogenesis or treatment. Sexual change was mentioned in 23 publications. Orgasmic headache is the most frequent type of HSA. The HSA occurs more frequent in dyadic than extradyadic sexual activity. Intercourse is the leading sexual act for HSA occurrence, following by masturbation. A few patients suffer HSA under specific sexual position, like kneeling, and trigger, such as cannabis. Pain can be rapidly ceased in half of patients when sexual activity was halted. Sexual function and sexual satisfaction may decrease in HSA patient and partner but improve after pain reversal. Conclusions: A shortage of sexuality data of HSA is documented in literature but that still clarifies the extradyadic and masturbatory effect on HSA occurrence. Nevertheless, HSA disturbs sexual function and satisfaction in patients and their partners. The pathogenesis of pain includes two components, the hypersympathetic status and exertional action. Therefore, physician can schedule their education and counseling for HSA according to these findings. Further investigation for sexual function and satisfaction is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are defined as syndromes characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation or behavior, which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. These are often associated with suffering or disabilities. It is known that one of the striking characteristics of certain disorders is related to their chronicity, which reduces the possibility of a cure and raises the discussion about controlling their symptoms to maintain the quality of life of individuals who suffer from them. A little associated but relevant intervention, if the state of chronic users in mental health is analyzed, is palliative care and its palliative actions that do not seek a cure, but to offer the maximum possible comfort to the user from diagnosis until their last day of life. Objective: Gather and analyze information regarding palliative psychiatry and its benefits for patients with mental disorders. Methodology: Articles published in indexed journals in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO), National Library of Medicine/NLM (MEDLINE), and National Library of Medicine/NLM (PUBMED) databases were evaluated, in addition to official sites such as the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the World Health Organization, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Results and Discussion: After completing the data collection phase, 33 relevant articles were identified for analysis of the proposed theme. It has been noted that palliative psychiatry encompasses a wide range of issues, including widely known mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, severe mental illnesses refractory to treatment, neuropalliative care, and symptom burden at various levels. Furthermore, it addresses ethical and psychosocial problems, psychological suffering, personality, desire and desire to die, dignity, loneliness, social isolation, as well as psychopharmacology. And that this care would be advantageous and of fundamental importance to patients with serious mental illnesses. Conclusion: Given the new perspectives for mental health care in an increasingly humanized way, the articles highlighted the benefits of palliative psychiatry and its importance in improving the quality of life of patients with serious mental disorders. However, it was also observed that many barriers need to be overcome to guarantee quality care for the group in question.",

The suicidal subject's mournïng reaction is arrested in one or more of the first three stages of grief: shock, protest, or detachment from the lost object.",

      "title": "Symptomatic therapy in multiple sclerosis: Big pharma should do more—YES",
      "abstract": "1Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a wide variety of clinical phenotypes. This can range from asymptomatic to relapsing–remitting to progressive disease phases as well as an overlapping period in between each of these phases. Each phase can further be classified as being active or not active. 1 It is well known that patients may remain in each type indefinitely or for a variable period before progressing to the next clinical phenotype. Patients may develop residual neurological deficits either from the very beginning or later at any time during the course of the disease. Although a benign course may be seen in up to one-quarter of patients, even these may have some mild motor or sensory symptoms that may cause some discomfort, fatigue that may interfere with their daily living activities or cognitive changes leading to some limitations in their professional life. Most MS patients will end up having some residual neurological symptoms. Although the residual symptoms correlate with some disability steps in MS, this may not always be the case. For example, people without significant motor findings may also have other symptoms that, once properly managed, will ease that individual’s life. However, despite the large proportion of patients affected with a wide variety of neurologic symptoms, the number of available symptomatic treatments is limited and they are only partially effective. It is clear that some of these MS-related symptoms are not MS specific and may be seen as a result of other neurological (and non-neurological) disorders resulting in a much larger patient population that requires such therapies. Regarding the available symptomatic therapies and their efficacies, it becomes clear that this is a neglected area with a high need of new therapies. The emphasis in MS has almost always been on large trials to slow or eliminate the disability worsening by eliminating relapses or shortening the time to recovery after relapses. However, many patients still have residual symptoms after a relapse and continue to develop progressive symptoms despite the available treatments. Currently, there are 12 approved disease-modifying long-term therapies in MS; some others are expected to be approved soon and many more are in clinical trials. However, none offers a cure, but rather reduce clinical relapses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) burden to a certain extent, with a less pronounced effect on long-term disability. These therapies continue to be effective in responders as long as they are used, but in some their efficacy may wear off over time. The higherefficacy disease-modifying therapies are also associated with more serious adverse events. So, it is clear that new treatments are needed for better long-term management of a progressive disease such as MS. The good news is that there are a large number of ongoing trials in this area, most sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.",

      "title": "Femoral Neck Stress Fracture Complicated by Deep Venous Thrombosis and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Stress fractures occur when repeated forces on a bone exceed its repair abilities. There are 3 situations in which stress fractures can arise: when an abnormal load is placed on normal bone, when a normal load is placed on abnormal bone, or when an abnormal load is placed on abnormal bone. When a stress fracture occurs in a female athlete, one needs to be suspicious of the female athlete triad: low bone density (osteopenia and osteoporosis), disordered eating, and menstrual dysfunction. The female athlete triad occurs when pressure to perform and maintain a low body mass leads to increased training and decreased caloric intake. Stress hormones produce hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction and menstrual irregularities. Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea leads to decreased estrogen production, which causes decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, and increased risk of stress fractures [1]. When stress fractures occur, they can normally be treated nonoperatively with relative rest and slow, pain-free return to activity. This process typically takes 3-18 weeks. Bone growth stimulators, which use either an electrical current or ultrasound, can facilitate bone healing. Possible complications secondary to stress fractures include delayed union, nonunion, avascular necrosis, and progression to complete fracture. To heal a stress fracture, patients must limit their activity. Because most patients with a stress fracture are not placed on strict bed rest or hospitalized, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is generally not indicated. Patients with Virchow triad of venous stasis, vessel wall injury, and hypercoagulable state are at greater risk for DVT formation. Other risk factors for DVT include advanced age, cancer, history of previous clots, and use of oral contraceptives or estrogens. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) can arise secondary to immobilization, a noxious event, neurological disease, or even after very minor injuries or microtrauma. CRPS is characterized by pain that is out of proportion to the injury, as well as allodynia and hyperalgesia. CRPS type 2 occurs after a nerve injury, whereas CRPS types 1 does not have an associated nerve injury. Physical examination findings of CRPS include edema, changes in skin blood flow, and abnormal sudomotor activity in the region of pain. Additional changes from CRPS include atrophy of skin and nails, changes in hair growth, and loss of function. The International Association for the Study of Pain has developed a set of 4 criteria for the diagnosis of CRPS type 1: the presence of a noxious event or immobilization; continued pain, allodynia, or hyperalgesia disproportionate to the event; evidence at sometime of edema, changes in skin blood flow, or abnormal sudomotor activity in the area of pain; and the diagnosis is excluded by the presence of another condition that would account for the symptoms. The pathogenesis of CRPS remains unclear. It is hypothesized that CRPS is sympathetically mediated pain. This is supported by trend that patients often improve with sympatholytic procedures. A stress fracture complicated by DVT and CRPS is an unusual clinical presentation. To the authors' knowledge, this constellation of conditions has not been reported in the literature. This report details a female athlete with a femoral stress fracture complicated by DVT and CRPS. The patient is a 37-year-old female triathlete with osteopenia and a T score of −2.2 standard deviations in the left femoral neck who is being treated with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Secondary amenorrhea of several years duration was recently treated with oral contraceptives. Her body mass index was 20.1, and she had clinical depression. The patient is very active, running 12 miles per week, biking 30 miles per week, and swimming. While doing sprints, she felt a \"pop\" and developed acute onset of severe left hip pain. Radiographs obtained showed abnormal sclerosis of the femoral neck (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an incomplete fracture line from the medial cortex (compression side) to the femoral neck measuring 1 cm with adjacent periosteal edema (Figure 2). She was given crutches and instructed to remain non–weight bearing on the left lower extremity. Plain radiograph shows mild sclerosis throughout the femoral neck (arrows). Magnetic resonance imaging of the left hip without contrast performed at the onset of pain shows bone marrow edema in the left femoral neck extending to the medial cortex. There is also an incomplete fracture line measuring 1 cm that extends from the medial cortex to the femoral neck. Three days after initiation of the non-weight bearing status, the patient developed left lower extremity edema. A Doppler ultrasound study showed a DVT and the patient was started on anticoagulation. The patient was also treated with a bone stimulator to accelerate bone healing and electrical stimulation to the muscles in her left lower extremity to maintain muscle bulk. The patient returned to clinic for follow-up 6 weeks later. At this time, her left lower extremity from the knee to her foot felt cool and her left foot had a purplish discoloration. The patient reported being compliant with her home exercise program of isometric muscle contractions. Venous and arterial Doppler Studies were repeated and showed resolution of the DVT. MRI repeated to monitor for bone healing and exclude another condition that could be the cause of the new leg symptoms showed an incompletely healed left medial side femoral neck stress fracture. The patient was diagnosed with CRPS type I based on the criteria established by the International Association for the Study of Pain. The patient was instructed on desensitization techniques and prescribed gabapentin and nortriptyline. After transitioning off of warfarin, the patient received a series of 3 lumbar sympathetic plexus blocks. After a third injection, she reported experiencing less discomfort and the color and temperature of her foot had started to normalize. MRI performed 4 months after the diagnosis of the stress fracture showed healing with minimal fracture line and subcortical edema. The patient remained toe-touch weight bearing for 7 months secondary to pain and incomplete bone healing. This patient has the female athlete triad consisting of osteopenia, menstrual irregularities, and disordered eating. Before the stress fracture, the patient had been evaluated and treated by an endocrinologist. Her work up included a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, which was completed 4 months before the fracture and showed a T score of −2.2 standard deviations. Her vitamin D level was checked 4 months before the fracture; this was found to be within normal limits. The patient was instructed to take calcium 1500 mg per day and vitamin D supplementation as well as oral contraceptives; however, she was not given a bisphosphonate medication secondary to the desire to become pregnant in the near future. Although she was being treated for her osteopenia and amenorrhea, the patient sustained a stress fracture after intensive training for a triathlon. This case stresses the importance of treating osteopenia and the female athlete triad with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. The treatment of a stress fracture varies based on its location. Compression side femoral neck stress fractures, like in this patient, are generally treated nonsurgically. On the contrary, tension side stress fractures may require surgical pinning. The patient was prescribed a bone stimulator to aide bone healing as these have been suggested to be effective and safe for healing fractures and non-unions in animal and human studies [2, 3]. The patient was also prescribed electrical stimulation to her left leg muscles to help maintain muscle bulk while her activity was limited by weight bearing restrictions. This patient remained toe-touch weight bearing for 7 months while awaiting resolution of her pain and healing of the fracture. This is an unusually long time; most stress fractures will heal in 3-18 weeks. The patient received surgical evaluation for possible pinning in week 11 of her course. She was not a surgical candidate secondary to the numerous complications that had arisen and the fact that her repeat MRIs continued to show improvement. The development of a DVT in an outpatient after 3 days of non–weight bearing is unusual. There are reports in the literature of DVT formation after lower extremity fractures including hip [4] and ankle fracture [5], but, no other reported cases in the literature of DVT formation after treatment of a stress fracture in the outpatient setting could be identified. A hypercoagulable workup did not reveal any factor or genetic abnormality that could account for the formation of a DVT. Despite the occurrence of a DVT, the patient continued to take oral contraceptives. The patient developed CRPS type I after femoral neck stress fracture, non–weight bearing, and DVT formation. There are reports of CRPS after minor lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries including ankle sprains and stress fractures of the foot [6]. Although the exact mechanism of why CRPS occurs is unclear, in this patient, DVT, protected weight bearing, and femoral neck stress fracture were sufficient insults to produce temperature changes, color changes, and pain in the distal lower extremity, typical of CRPS. Normally, early, active mobilization of the affected area is recommended treatment for CRPS. However, in this situation, weight bearing and exercise of the left lower extremity was limited by a healing stress fracture. It was challenging to find a balance between treating the stress fracture, the CRPS, and DVT. Physical therapy, isometric exercises, desensitization techniques, electrical stimulation of the leg muscles, and medications were of limited efficacy in treating this patient's CRPS. As a compromise, the authors advised her in toe-touch weight bearing precautions to help treat the CRPS while still allowing the stress fracture to heal. The patient also responded positively to sympathetic blocks. The development of a DVT after stress fracture is rare. DVT prophylaxis is likely not indicated for patients with stress fractures. However, clinicians should have an index of suspicion for DVTs in a patient who is non–weight bearing while healing a stress fracture, especially when he or she has risk factors for DVT formation. In addition, recognition and subsequent treatment of the female athlete triad can help to prevent stress fractures from occurring. Finally, sympathetic blocks are an effective treatment modality for patients with CRPS secondary to femoral neck stress fracture and DVT, a situation in which weight bearing and mobilization are contraindicated.",

      "title": "Overview: Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Summary An disorder is marked by extremes. It is present when a person experiences severe disturbances in behavior, such as extreme reduction of food intake or extreme overeating, or feelings of extreme distress or concern about body weight or shape. A person with an disorder may have started out just smaller or larger amounts of food than usual, but at some point, the urge to eat less or more spirals out of control. Eating disorders are very complex, and despite scientific research to understand them, the biological, behavioral and social underpinnings of these illnesses remain elusive. The two main types of disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. A third category is eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), which includes several variations of disorders. Eating disorders frequently appear during adolescence or young adulthood, but some reports indicate that they can develop during childhood or later in adulthood. Women and girls are much more likely than males to develop an disorder. Men and boys account for an estimated 5 to 15 percent of patients with anorexia or bulimia and an estimated 35 percent of those with binge-eating disorder. Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses with complex underlying psychological and biological causes. They frequently co-exit with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders. People with disorders also can suffer from numerous other physical health complications, such as heart conditions or kidney failure, which can lead to death.",

For the purposes of this chapter, moderate adverse sedation-related events represent physiologic change that is extremely likely to lead to significant patient harm if unnoticed or responded to ineffectively by the sedationist. Apnea, airway obstruction, and laryngospasm are examples. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 400 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training so that sedationists can effectively respond to these adverse events or preempt them. Even though they are categorized as “moderate” and may not be associated with harm in and of themselves, these events may certainly progress to produce significant harm.",

Bipolar disorders, particularly \"soft\" forms, share symptoms such as depressive mood, irritability or mood reactivity with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, posing challenges on differential diagnosis. In the present work a case of a woman suffering from cyclothymia is reported, with mood episodes confined in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Case Report. A 42-year-old married Caucasian woman is presented, suffering from mood disorder episodes lasting for 10-12 days each, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and remitting after the beginning of her menses. The mood episodes occurred since the age of 20, in almost every menstrual cycle. The patient described hypomanic symptoms during the first 4-5 days of the luteal phase, reporting irritable mood, pressured speech, increased libido as well as vividness of her perceptions and excessive goal-directed activity. The hypomanic symptoms were followed by irritable and depressive mood, fatigue, hypersomnia, tearfulness, decreased self-esteem and pessimism, lasting for another 6-7 days. The patient also reported migraine and binge-eating episodes during each depressive phase. A full range of examinations, including blood and hormonal tests, yielded normal results. Lamotrigine was titrated at 200 mg/day, with subsequent amelioration of symptoms. The exact relationship between premenstrual dysphoric disorder and other disturbances, which either coexist, or deteriorate premenstrually, or even synchronize with the menstrual cycle, has not been elucidated yet. Studies aiming at a better understanding of this relationship could aid at accurate diagnosis and treatment.",

The severe and predominantly psychological form of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The exact aetiology of PMS is not known. PMS results from ovulation and appears to be caused by the progesterone produced following ovulation in women who have enhanced sensitivity to this progesterone. The increased sensitivity may be due to neurotransmitter (mainly serotonin) dysfunction. The key diagnostic feature is that the symptoms must be absent in the time between the end of menstruation and ovulation. Prospective symptom rating charts are used for this purpose. Treatment is achieved by suppression of ovulation or reducing progesterone sensitivity with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. In this chapter, the authors describe the aetiology, symptoms, diagnosis and evidence-based management of premenstrual syndrome.",

      "title": "Geriatric Seizures",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Seizures have been defined as an intermittent derangement of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. The discharge results in an almost instantaneous disturbance of sensation, convulsive movements, altered or impaired cognition, or some combination thereof.1 Although seizures originating in patients aged 65 and older were once considered to be rare, they are remarkably frequent, with an incidence rate higher than 100 in 100,000. On an age-specific basis, other than the neonatal period, the highest incidence of new onset seizures occurs in the population aged 65 and older.2 Clinically, geriatric seizures are not different from those of children, adolescents, and younger adults, except for petit mal siezures, which almost never originate in older persons.3 Moreover, onset of seizures after aged 65 years and older is more often symptomatic and associated with injury than in younger individuals.4 The incidence of late-onset seizure progressively increases with each decade beyond age 60 (see Table 1).5 The etiology of this occurrence depends to a large extent on age and “cognitive integrity.”6 The most common etiologies of geriatric seizures include, with ranges of frequency, cerebrovascular disease (11%–54%), undetermined, (13%–43.5%), brain neoplasm (2.1%–33%), multifactorial etiology (6%–20%), head trauma (4.3%–21%), Alzheimers disease (9.1%–17%), metabolic disorders (6.5%–10%), and central nervous system infection (2%–4%).7-9 Seizures are the third-most-common neurological disorder in older persons, with cerebrovascular accidents being the most-common precipitant for a seizure after the age of 60. Neurodegenerative diseases are now accepted as a not-infrequent cause of seizures in older people,3 and advanced Alzheimer's disease is associated with a sixfold increased risk of unprovoked seizure, after controlling for age and gender.10 Older persons and dementia populations differ as to proportion and type of neurotransmitter declines but both are overrepresented in epilepsy epidemiology. Neuronal conduction abnormalities in the aging brain, whether associated with changes in the amount or activity of specific neurotransmitters or with reduced sensitivity to them, is thought to be associated with some of the more-prevalent emotional, behavioral, and neurological disorders of older persons. The relationship between central nervous system function and individual neurotransmitters remains only partially recognized. Less well appreciated is the interdependency of major neurotransmitter systems. Understanding of the intra- and interdependent roles within the central neurointegrative network may provide new insights into disorders of cognition in older people. As researchers gain more appreciation of the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation, we may be able to develop therapeutic agents designed to suppress seizure-provoking mechanisms and to enhance the brain's natural protective mechanisms.11",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder with hallucination (alcoholic hallucinosis) occurs after long-term abuse of alcohol and is characterized by intermittent or continuous symptoms during a period of excessive alcohol consumption or immediately after that period. Symptoms commonly include hallucinations, mostly of the auditory type, and affective disturbances, in a background of clear consciousness. In this case series, four subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption were evaluated for hallucinatory symptoms after chronic alcohol intake. All of them had auditory hallucinations, with an anxious affect and no cognitive deficits. Only one case had visual hallucinations. The psychotic symptoms in all the patients were completely remitted with antipsychotics. Resumption of alcohol consumption increases the risk of relapse. The pathophysiology of alcoholic hallucinosis is not yet established and needs to be studied further for better diagnosis and management.",

The purpose of this paper is to present hoarseness as an unrecognized symptom of premenstrual tension, briefly to describe this entity, to discuss the mechanism accounting for vocal huskiness and loss of vocal control, and to give clinical examples. Premenstrual tension is characterized usually by a feeling of pelvic discomfort, varying degrees of edema with a temporary weight gain of 4-10 pounds or more, unreasonable emotional outbursts, restlessness, and irritability. It is sometimes characterized by painful turgidity of the breasts and occasionally by recurring migraine, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbated dermatoses, and allergic rhinitis. Psychotic episodes and epileptoid seizures have been reported as rare symptoms. The etiology of premenstrual tension is unknown.

      "title": "Сексуальные дисфункции при тревожных расстройствах",
      "abstract": "Введение. Являясь одним из широко распространенных психических заболеваний, тревожные расстройства часто сопровождаются сексуальными дисфункциями. Фармакотерапия, применяемая в лечении тревожных расстройств, в свою очередь может приводить к побочным сексуальным нарушениям. О наличии проблем в интимной сфере при обращении за психиатрической помощью сообщает лишь небольшая часть пациентов. Однако несвоевременное выявление сексуальных дисфункций может снижать приверженность терапии и ее эффективность. Материалы и методы. Статья посвящена обзору, основанному на 21 источнике, в том числе на 9 систематических обзорах и других исследованиях. Поиск данных осуществлялся по названиям, аннотациям и ключевым словам: сексуальная дисфункция, тревожное и стрессовое расстройства (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) в базах данных Elibrary и PubMed. Результаты. При тревожных расстройствах сексуальные дисфункции наблюдаются как у мужчин, так и у женщин и проявляются нарушениями всех фаз сексуальных реакций. Взаимосвязь сексуальных дисфункций с тревожными расстройствами объясняется тремя моделями. Первая, включающая причинно-следственные связи, предполагает, что корреляция между сексуальной дисфункцией и тревожными расстройствами часто является двунаправленной, причем симптомы сексуального и тревожного расстройства могут проявляться одновременно. Вторая модель предполагает наличие общего основного фактора или скрытой предиспозиции, вызывающих со временем развитие как психических, так и сексуальных расстройств, Третья модель концептуализирует сексуальные дисфункции как нарушения, не связанные с тревожными расстройствами. Заключение. На основании проведенного исследования авторами рекомендован следующий алгоритм курации пациентов, страдающих тревожными расстройствами и сексуальными нарушениями. На этапе обращения за психиатрической помощью, наряду со стандартными методами диагностики для определения выраженности психической патологии, целесообразно использовать опросники для оценки сексуальной функции. Кроме того, следует учитывать возможное негативное влияние фармакотерапии на сексуальную функцию и оценивать ее на всех этапах лечения для проведения своевременной коррекции. При выявлении сексуальных нарушений у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами с учетом клинической ситуации по возможности назначаются психотропные препараты с минимальным негативным влиянием на сексуальную функцию или без такового. При невозможности применения таких средств после достижения коррекции тревожной симптоматики могут быть снижены дозы используемых психотропных препаратов, рекомендованы перерывы в их приеме, в основном за 1-2 дня до предполагаемого сексуального контакта. При сохранении сексуальных нарушений в схему лечения в качестве антидота добавляется антидепрессант без влияния на сексуальную функцию или препараты для коррекции сексуальных нарушений – ингибиторы фосфодиэстеразы 5-го типа. Психотерапевтические мероприятия, включающие секс-терапию, являются неотъемлемой частью лечения сексуальных дисфункций у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами. Background. Anxiety disorders, being one of the widespread mental illnesses, are often accompanied by sexual dysfunctions. In turn, pharmacotherapy used in the treatment of affective disorders can lead to adverse sexual disorders. Only a small proportion of patients report having problems in the intimate sphere when seeking psychiatric help. However, untimely detection of sexual dysfunctions can reduce adherence and effectiveness of therapy. Materials and methods. The article is devoted to a review based on 21 sources, of which 9 are systematic reviews, as well as other studies. The data was searched by names, annotations and keywords: sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) in the databases Elibrary and PubMed. Results. In anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions are observed in both men and women and are manifested by violations of all phases of sexual reactions. The relationship of sexual dysfunction with anxiety disorders is explained by three models: the first, which includes causal relationships, suggests that the correlation between sexual dysfunction and anxiety disorders is often bidirectional, and the symptoms of sexual and anxiety disorders can manifest simultaneously; The second model assumes the presence of a common underlying factor, or hidden predisposition, causing the development of both mental and sexual disorders over time; the third model conceptualizes sexual dysfunctions as disorders unrelated to anxiety disorders. Conclusion. Based on the conducted research, the authors recommended the following algorithm for the supervision of patients suffering from anxiety disorders and sexual disorders: at the stage of seeking psychiatric help, along with standard diagnostic methods to determine the severity of mental pathology, it is advisable to use questionnaires to assess sexual function. In addition, the possible negative effect of pharmacotherapy on sexual function should be taken into account and evaluated at all stages of treatment in order to carry out timely correction. If sexual disorders are detected in patients with anxiety disorders, taking into account the clinical situation, psychotropic drugs with no or minimal negative effect on sexual function are prescribed, if possible. In cases where it is impossible to use such drugs, after achieving correction of anxiety symptoms, the doses of psychotropic drugs used may be reduced, interruptions in their intake, mainly 1-2 days before the alleged sexual contact. If sexual disorders persist, an antidepressant with no effect on sexual function is added to the treatment regimen as an antidote, or drugs for correcting sexual disorders – type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Psychotherapeutic measures, including sex therapy, are an integral part of the treatment of sexual dysfunctions in patients with anxiety disorders.",

Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood and affects approximately1% of\r\nthe population. EOS begins before the age of eighteen, while VEOS begins before the age of\r\nthirteen. Since etiopathogenesis remains unclear, there are various theories about the emergence\r\nof schizophrenia: the dopamine theory, the genetic theory, the psychodynamic theory, the\r\nenvironmental theory and other. Schizophrenia is a multidimensional disease characterized by\r\nheterogeneous symptoms. The psychotic symptoms are present in children and adolescents even\r\nbefore the diagnosis of the disease. The symptoms are divided into positive, negative and\r\ndisorganisation symptoms. The expression of symptoms in children differs from those in adults\r\ndue to the cognitive variation of different ages. The delay of the cognitive development is quite\r\noften in EOS. The cognitive impairment is a basic symptom of schizophrenia and it has an\r\ninfluence on the course and recovery. DSM-V define the criteria for the diagnosis: delusions,\r\nhallucinations, disorganized speech or behaviour, and negative symptoms. The indicators of a\r\nworse outcome are: worse cognition, male sex, earlier beginning, poor economic condition, long\r\nnon-treated period, previous lower social adjustment, and negative symptoms. The most common\r\ncomorbidity is drug abuse. The conditions considered for differential diagnosis are: general\r\nmedical conditions, other psychotic disorders, pervasive developmental disorder and autism.\r\nTherapy include: antipsychotics, psychoeducation and psychotherapy. Antipsychotics are the\r\nfirst-line therapy, and the atipycal antipsychotics are the first choice. Typical (classical) and\r\natypical (newer) antipsychotics are used in therapy. It is necessary to include psychotherapy,\r\nparticularly cognitive therapy and psychoeducation.",

Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

Although arguments favoring the occurrence of epilepsy‐induced disorders of behavior must not be presented in a way that adds to the stigmata associated with epilepsy, it is not in the best interest of epileptic patients to deny this possible relationship and overlook an opportunity to prevent or treat a major cause of disability. There is evidence to suggest that psychosocial factors cannot account for all the behavioral problems suffered by patients with epilepsy. Behavioral disturbances ascribed to antiepileptic drugs and specific structural lesions may also be due, in part, to epileptogenic mechanisms. Some interictal behavioral disturbances may actually reflect unrecognized ictal events. Most importantly, data obtained from clinical research and animal investigations suggest testable hypotheses of how recurrent epileptic seizures can alter neuronal function in ways that would predispose to specific disruptive interictal behaviors, such as aggression, depression and schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Glycogen Storage Disease Type V",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Glycogen storage disease type V (GSDV, McArdle disease) is a metabolic myopathy characterized by exercise intolerance manifested by rapid fatigue, myalgia, and cramps in exercising muscles. Symptoms are usually precipitated by isometric exercise or sustained aerobic exercise. Most individuals improve their exercise tolerance by exploiting the second-wind phenomenon with relief of myalgia and fatigue after a few minutes of rest. Age of onset is frequently in the first decade of life but can vary; however, diagnosis is typically delayed as myalgia and fatigability are dismissed/overlooked. Fixed muscle weakness occurs in approximately 25% of affected individuals, is more likely to involve proximal muscles, and is more common in individuals of advanced age. Approximately 50% of affected individuals have recurrent episodes of myoglobinuria that can – on occasion – eventually result in acute renal failure. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of GSDV is established in a proband with suggestive findings and by identification of biallelic PYGM (encoding glycogen phosphorylase, muscle form) pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing or – if genetic test results are not diagnostic – by assay of muscle myophosphorylase enzyme activity. Management Treatment of manifestations: Although no cure for GSDV is available, affected individuals benefit from moderate-intensity aerobic training (e.g., walking or brisk walking, bicycling) to increase cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle oxidative capacity. Pre-exercise ingestion of sports drinks containing simple carbohydrates improves exercise tolerance and may protect against exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis. Surveillance: Annual routine physical examination and review of diet. Agents/circumstances to avoid: To prevent occurrence of cramps and myoglobinuria, avoid intense isometric exercise and maximal aerobic exercise. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When the family-specific PYGM pathogenic variants are known, early detection of GSDV in relatives at risk ensures proper management to prevent muscle injury leading to rhabdomyolysis and to improve long-term outcome, particularly by development of a healthy lifestyle (i.e., regular exercise such as brisk walking) in childhood. Genetic counseling GSDV is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Once the pathogenic variants in the family are known, carrier testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Chronic migraine is the most frequent complication of migraine. It is defined by the presence of headache on 15 or more days a month, of which at least eight must meet the criteria of migraine without aura for a minimum of three months. In addition they must not be due to medication abuse or attributable to any other cause.The prevalence of chronic migraine ranges between 1-3% of the population and its incidence has been estimated to be 2.5% per year. It produces from four to six times more disability, decreased productivity and disruption of quality of life than episodic migraine. The development of chronic migraine has been associated with both non-modifiable risk factors (being female, low socio-economic status and level of schooling) and modifiable risk factors (anxiety, depression, sleep apnoea/snoring, obesity, consumption of painkillers and caffeine). Patients with chronic migraine suffer from chronic pain, anxiety or depression two to three times more often than those with episodic migraine. Management requires identification and control of the risk factors that predispose patients to develop the condition, detoxification therapy in the event of abuse of analgesics, specific treatment for migraine attacks and preventive treatment. The effectiveness of the preventive drugs topiramate and Onabotulinumtoxin A in this complication of migraine has been proved in large-scale placebo-controlled clinical trials.Chronic migraine is a common condition that requires global management aimed at reducing the frequency of the attacks, lowering the associated disability and improving the patients' quality of life.",

Many young people referred for residential treatment have a long history of family dysfunction that may include experiences of abuse, \ndomestic violence, substance abuse in the home, or neglect, and often school failure \nand aggressive and self-destructive behaviors. Typical diagnoses include Major Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychotic Disorders, Conduct Disorder, Substance \nAbuse Disorders, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, and other severe personality and \npsychological disorders.

      "abstract": "Between 25 and 30% of the victims of a whiplash injury have complaints after one year. This condition is referred to as late whiplash syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by pain of the neck, headache, forgetfulness, poor concentration, mental fatigue, and affective symptoms. The causes of the persistent symptoms are unknown. In all, the evidence that late-whiplash syndrome is a neurological disorder is flimsy. Current opinion holds that the acute basis is the painful injury of the neck. In the months following the accident, pain is the substrate on which psychological and social factors may act. Emotional symptoms such as lability of affect and disturbed mood, or posttraumatic stress disorders are common after whiplash. Although there is definitely a place for psychiatrists and psychologists in the treatment of late whiplash syndrome, these professionals are not involved in late whiplash disorder as much as they should be. Brief psychological treatment has proven to significantly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Optimal management must cover the treatment of pain, depression, anxiety, and fatigue; adequate psycho-education, stressing the good long-term outcome; and education of patients and relatives on possible cognitive symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

A variety of other psychopathology may present: obsessive-compulsive features, alcohol dependency, voyeurism, sadism, possessiveness and domineering, hyper-sexuality, paranoid attitude, abuse of different nature, violent behaviour, including, occasionally, homicide. Yet, in the author's opinion, the syndrome, unless it presents itself as obviously absurd, is frequently missed. Management is rather difficult and does not always result in recovery but, if not treated with neuroleptics, it would render any other means of treatment useless. The condition could pose a diagnostic challenge. Moreover, it also poses an ethical dilemma whether to warn the spouse of the psychotic condition of the partner, the poor prognosis and possible implications of its existence. Moreover, the long-term partners of such patients frequently present with the symptoms of dependency, submissiveness or even masochism.

Objectives To describe and discuss two clinical cases of DI, in order to show two different ways of presenting in this entity. Methods Two case report and non-systematic review. Results We present the case of a 76-year-old woman, without psychiatric history, with an DI with 5 years of evolution, referred to a psychiatric consultation by a dermatologist. The second case, is a 41-year-old woman with a history of multiple substance use disorder, with an DI with a month of evolution, who resorted to the emergency department. DI is not a single diagnostic entity. The classic form, as represented in the first case,is a primary form, which develops without any known cause or underlying disease, corresponding to a persistent delusional disorder. However, about 60% of patients have secondary forms of DI, in the context of substance misuse, some medications or in the course of physical or psychiatric diseases (e.g. stroke, delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia). Conclusions DI can occur as a primary delusional disorder or secondary to several other medical conditions. An in-depth clinical history is essential in order to make the correct diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach is also important, to exclude any possible organic etiology, not forgetting that many patients may turn to other medical specialities first.

Overall, 90.9% of Latin American women will have at least one climacteric symptom and in 25%, these will be severe. Musculoskeletal pain, physical and mental fatigue and depressed mood are the most common climacteric symptoms. Dyspareunia, mood disorders and irritability can significantly alter female sexuality. Hot flashes are the symptoms most frequently related to menopause by both physicians and patients. However, it is one of the less common menopausal symptoms. This symptom reflects the neurochemical brain disorders caused by estrogen deficiency. The central nervous system (CNS) is also involved in changes of body composition leading to higher adipose tissue accumulation during climacterium, deteriorating quality of life and increasing the risk for chronic non-transmittable diseases. Menopausal discomfort also overloads health systems increasing the demand for medical services and decreasing productivity by labor absenteeism. Hormone therapy of menopause (HTM) decreases menopausal symptoms and improves quality of life. If we do not prescribe HTM to those women who need it, we could deprive them from several potential health benefits.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A substantial minority (23%) of children between 7 and 12 years of age attending general practice were found to have psychiatric disorders. Disturbance was slightly more frequent in girls than in boys, and emotional disorder was the most common diagnosis. Psychiatric disorder was associated with psychological disadvantage (broken homes, the child had lived away from the family, family history of psychiatric disorder) and with current high levels of parental stress in relation to their children. Disturbed children tended to present with symptoms of anxiety, bed‐wetting, hayfever, nosebleeds or scabies. Amongst a subsample of children consulting in general practice, psychiatric disorder may be a relevant factor contributing to somatic consultation.",

      "abstract": "The structure and time-course of epileptic attacks were analyzed in 75 patients with temporal epilepsy making use of the EEG readings. The results have permitted the identification of additional diagnostic criteria. When the epileptic focus is localized in the right temporal lobe, focal and generalized epileptic attacks begin in early childhood. The subsequent complication of the epileptic structure occurs most frequently on the sixth day of the disease. Psychosensory aura and psychomotor attacks are the most frequent manifestations of the pathology. They occur daily in half of the cases but sometimes the frequency is reduced. When the epileptic focus is localized in the left lobe, the disease manifests itself in late childhood or adolescence. Vegetative visceral aura is a frequent finding. Already in the first two-three years epileptic fits become polymorphic. In the majority of cases generalized convulsive attacks are combined with various focal paroxysms, with vegetative, visceral and motor manifestations being predominant. Almost all patients have daily attacks, quite often they are serial or have a stationary course. The frequency of attacks always tends to increase.",

      "abstract": "The exact physiological role of DHEA remains unknown but DHEA supplementation has recently been proven beneficial in typical deficient states like adrenal insufficiency or major depressive illlnesses. The putative favorable effects of DHEA in other conditions remain controversial. However, recent studies confirmed positive effects of DHEA administration in healthy elderly people, mostly more than 70 years old women, on skin, bone density, muscle strength and several neuropsychological symptoms. Positive effects on sexual interest and satisfaction and sense of well-being are more consistent in elderly women than in men. The recommended administered dose is 25 mg to 50 mg once a day in women and 100 mg in men. Androgenic side effects (greasy skin, acne, increased growth of body hair) are frequent but reversible side effects. Dose adaptation is recommended in these conditions. It is justifiable to prescribe DHEA in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Other possible indications are depression and prolonged glucocorticoid therapy. In elderly people, DHEA administration might be considered in DHEA depleted-patients with skin dryness or atrophy, muscle weakness, low bone density or neuropsychological symptoms. The treatment should be taken under close medical supervision in order to detect a possible hormone-dependent cancer such as breast cancer in women and prostatic cancer in men. The patients should be informed on the potential risks of DHEA administration and on the lack of definitive proven beneficial effects of DHEA, waiting the results of well-conducted controlled double blind prospective studies.",

      "abstract": "Adrenal incidentaloma (AI) includes all lesions with diameter ≥ 1 cm found incidentally during imaging examinations not associated with suspected adrenal pathology. Every adrenal incidentaloma requires a detailed hormonal and imaging assessment. Initial diagnosis includes radiological phenotypical evaluation (particularly in CT, or in case of contraindications — in MRI) and biochemical assessment of tumour hormonal activity (which includes cortisol circadian rhythm, salivary cortisol concentration, 24-hour urinary free-cortisol and metanephrines test, short cortisol and dexamethasone suppression test, ACTH level assessment, aldosterone and ARO concentration, adrenal androgen concentration). Each diagnostic step is associated with limitations and method imperfections. The influence of administered medications, age and concomitant diseases must be taken into account when interpreting test results. It is important to remember abovementioned factors may cause false positive or false negative test results. The following paper is to summarize the etiology of the most common diagnostic mishaps which frequently lead to misdiagnoses, an increase in patient's anxiety and, as a consequence, in the introduction of improper therapy or its discontinuation. The awareness of biochemical and imaging test limitations, and the knowledge of false positive and false negative result sources, allows for the optimisation of the diagnostic process. Simultaneously, the analyzed factors may contribute to a decrease in unnecessary and frequently repeated tests. Additionally, it may imply avoiding the costs of unjustified deep diagnostics.",

O rim pode perder suas capacidades funcionais, sem causar maiores danos ao paciente. Entretanto, quando a perda e maior do que 75% comecam a surgir problemas de saude, devido as alteracoes funcionais graves e progressivas. Pacientes portadores de insuficiencia renal cronica tem, geralmente, sido submetidos a dois tipos de tratamento: a dialise peritoneal e a hemodialise. O numero de pacientes que sao submetidos a dialise peritoneal e da ordem de 2% a 5% dos renais cronicos e o restante desta percentagem sao submetidos a hemodialise. Todo paciente cronico apresenta algum tipo de comprometimento emocional, podendo afetar diversos aspectos da vida do individuo, tais como: relacionamentos, autoestima, qualidade de vida e esperancas de sobrevivencia. Com o problema renal, ainda podem ocorrer alteracoes psicologicas, emocionais e intelectuais. Esse trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar o nivel de estresse em renais cronicos que eram submetidos a hemodialise e verificar se a intervencao de relaxamento fisiologico poderia reduzir os niveis de estresse. A pesquisa foi realizada apos ter sido aprovada pelo Comite de Etica da UniFil, com criterios de inclusao e exclusao. Foi aplicado um questionario com perguntas fechadas, avaliacao de nivel de estresse e avaliacao de experiencias recentes. Foram selecionados dois grupos para pesquisa, um de controle e outro de intervencao,nos quais os escolhidos eram pacientes renais cronicos com diagnostico ha mais de tres anos, realizavam hemodialise de duas a tres vezes por semana e com idade superior a vinte anos. Apos essa selecao, foi aplicado o inventario de sintomas de estresse para adultos de Lipp (ISSL), para verificar se o relaxamento progressivo de Jacobson produziria a reducao de estresse nesta populacao. Verificou-se que os sintomas do nivel de estresse diminuiram e que alguns pacientes passaram da fase de exaustao para a fase de resistencia. A predominância do estresse antes psicologico passou para fisico/psicologico. Acredita-se que essas mudancas ocorreram devido a intervencao atraves do relaxamento aplicado. Diante dos resultados significativos com relacao ao estresse, sugere-se uma intervencao terapeutica visando a reducao de estresse com os renais cronicos, no qual se obteve grande exito na pesquisa realizada.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Body image is a person’s perception of his/her physical appearance. There is little relation between the actual appearance and sense of attractiveness. Great physical appearance doesn’t guarantee a positive body image, or does lacking natural beauty lead to a negative body image. In fact, beauty doesn’t properly reflect one’s feelings of body image; it depends on one’s appearance. There are relations between body image and feeling, thinking and acting in particular conditions (1). One of the key features of the ‘Body Dysmorphic Disorder’ (BDD) definition is excessive preoccupation with slight or imagined defect in body appearance (2). BDD has the worst outcome of all the body image disorders (3). Since BDD has a negative impact on quality of life (4) screening BDD patients in clinical settings seems important (5). Sense of body image may put an adolescent’s physical health at risk (6). However, physical concerns don't necessarily reflect body dysmorphic disorder (7). In addition, there are high numbers of BDD patients that have extreme body image dissatisfaction (8). The main feature of BDD is excessive attention to negative body image. Subsequently, negative evaluation of images can lead to rumination, mood changes and compulsive behaviors (3). Self-worth based upon appearance (9) and poor body image is important in BDD (10). The feeling of attractiveness (11) and body image can influence BDD symptoms (12). BDD patients have high rates of suicidal ideation and attempts and also completed suicide attempts (13). Since this disorder can have a devastating effect on the quality of a person's life, it seems necessary to identify it at an early stage (14). Compared to men, women are more likely to undergo cosmetic surgery. Lack of body satisfaction can predict cosmetic surgery. Experience of cosmetic surgery among family or friends can increase the rate of cosmetic surgery in women. Media has no effect on the rate of cosmetic surgery",

A history of maltreatment is found in 80–90% of young offenders, and about one quarter of individuals with a history of severe maltreatment receive criminal convictions. Among the forensic psychiatric patients admitted to the REMS (Residential Facilities for the Enforcement of Security Measures), we have likewise observed a high prevalence of maltreatment, abuse, neglect, and other traumatic events, including those related to war and migratory pathways. We have treated some patients showing psychotic-spectrum symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) that did not respond to pharmacological treatment (including clozapine and clozapine–first-generation antipsychotic combinations). Their condition improved only when trauma-oriented psychotherapy, such as EMDR or Narrative Exposure Therapy for Forensic Offender Rehabilitation (FORNET), was added to antipsychotic treatment. This observation raises critical questions about the overlap between psychotic and post-traumatic symptoms in offending patients with severe early victimization histories, and hence about the link between schizophrenia spectrum disorders and complex post-traumatic stress disorder. In light of ongoing conflicts, rising geopolitical tensions, and their impact on migration, the early diagnosis and effective treatment of these conditions are of paramount importance from both a public health perspective and from the standpoint of security and the prevention of violent offenses Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

A severe, chronic brain disorder, schizophrenia is characterized by an onset in early adulthood, a lifelong course, debilitating symptoms, deterioration in functional ability, and lack of social acceptability, making it among the most disabling, and economically catastrophic disorders.2 Symptoms appear in men in their late teens or early 20s, whereas women are generally affected in their 20s or early 30s.3 In the U.S., annual direct and indirect costs of the disorder total more than $62 billion.4\r\n\r\nFour symptom clusters have been observed in large groups of patients.5 Positive symptoms (psychosis) are correlated with hospital admission and a first-time diagnosis. Delusions are the most common psychotic symptom and occur in 65% of patients with schizophrenia.6,7 Hallucinations and disorganized thinking occur in approximately 50% of these patients. Auditory hallucinations are the most common sensory disturbance, but visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations may occur.8 Most patients experience a combination of delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorganization.6\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms represent a loss of affective responsiveness, verbal expression, personal motivation, enjoyment, social drive, or attention to the environment.9 All cognitive domains are also affected by the disorder, including attention, language, memory, and executive function.10 The combination of blunted, inappropriate, and odd expressions is the most common affective disturbance in schizophrenia.11 Depressive symptoms are the most common mood disturbance in schizophrenia.12\r\n\r\nIn 2002, direct annual health care costs were estimated at $22.7 billion for the U.S., $7.6 billion in other direct costs, and $32.4 billion in lost economic productivity and caregiver costs, for a total of $62.7 billion.4 Schizophrenia accounts for 2.5% of all health care expenditures, 25% of hospital beds, and 20% of all Social Security benefit days. 13 Genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia, with alterations in neurotransmitter pathways (e.g., with dopamine) and enlarged sulci and ventricles found on brain imaging.14",

En el caso de la depresión, la última clasificación de la Asociación Americana de Psiquiatría (DSM-5) (2013) sustituyó el especificador “de comienzo en el posparto” por “con inicio en el periparto” porque muchas depresiones posparto comienzan en el embarazo. Empero, la denominación posparto sigue siendo válida, y debe conservarse con independencia de si su inicio fue en el posparto (hasta seis meses después del parto) o en el embarazo. Los síntomas depresivos puerperales pueden encontrarse en la disforia, la DPP (monopolar o bipolar) o la psicosis afectiva puerperal. La DPP y la psicosis comprometen el funcionamiento materno y se asocian a alteraciones del vínculo madre/hijo(a). El tratamiento oportuno y la prevención de estos trastornos minimizan los riesgos y favorecen la salud de la madre y su descendencia. The puerperium is a period of increased psychic vulnerability and postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common obstetric complication. In the last classification of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5) (2013), the specifier “with postpartum onset” was replaced by the specificer “with peripartum onset” to acknowledge the fact that many PPDs start during pregnancy. However, the postpartum denomination remains a valid one and should be kept regardless the depression started in pregnancy or up to six months postpartum. Puerperal depressive symptoms may be found in the postpartum blues, unipolar or bipolar PPD or puerperal affective psychosis. PPD and psychosis cause impairment of maternal functioning and affect the mother-infant relationship. Timely treatment and prevention of these disorders minimize risks and favour the health of the mother and that of the offspring.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder in Children",
      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

En más del 50% de los casos las lesiones se presentan en cabeza, cara y cuello. Es por eso que el odontólogo y especialmente el odontopediatra deben estar preparados para reconocer alguna forma de maltrato o negligencia con base en una historia clínica adecuada y una exploración intencionada ante la sospecha de síndrome de niño maltratado. Objetivo: Conocer los indicadores intraorales y extraorales que le permitan al odontopediatra reconocer los signos y contribuir en el diagnóstico como parte de un equipo multidisciplinario encargado de la atención de estos pacientes. Caso clínico: Paciente masculino de dos años cinco meses quien acude al Servicio de Urgencias del Instituto Nacional de Pediatría por presentar edema periorbitario, múltiples fracturas en extremidades e indicadores orofaciales que permitieron diagnosticar síndrome de niño maltratado. Conclusión: Considerando la frecuencia con que las estructuras orofaciales se ven involucradas en el síndrome de niño maltratado, existe un compromiso médico, ético y legal para que todos los dentistas y específicamente los odontopediatras intervengan en la prevención, detección, diagnóstico y tratamiento de este problema médico social.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

La experiencia clinica muestra situaciones concretas donde es probable que exista una cierta confusion de terminos. Asi, se pueden entender de manera erronea como sedacion paliativa los casos de tratamiento sintomatico del delirium hiperactivo en la etapa de ultimos dias (una situacion que se presenta a menudo como la primera causa de sedacion en agonia) o aquellos en que se lleva a cabo un aumento progresivo de la medicacion paliativa, que con frecuencia puede tener un efecto sedante, paralelo a la mayor intensidad de los sintomas en enfermos con un deterioro severo debido a la progresion de la enfermedad. En ambos casos se emplean farmacos con efecto sedante para aliviar las complicaciones clinicas y el sufrimiento en un enfermo que tiene la muerte cercana pero las circunstancias del enfermo, el objetivo de estos tratamientos y el modo en que se emplean no coinciden con la definicion de sedacion paliativa. EnglishPalliative sedation in defined as the deliberate reduction in the level of consciousness of the patient by administering the appropriate drugs in order to avoid intense suffering caused by one or more refractory symptoms; sedation in the patient who is in his last days or hours of life is assumed to be continuous and as deep as needed. Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

Routine serum calcium determination and parathyroid hormone radioimmuno-assay allow to make an early diagnosis in still asymptomatic subjects. In the elderly the clinical features of the disease are often aspecific presenting with psychiatric and/or neuromuscular and/or cardiovascular disorders. This report refers to a 75 year-old woman admitted to our Department with a suspicion of senile dementia. She was affected by loss of memory, hallucinations, nausea, loss of appetite, mild polydipsia and polyuria. The patient was dependent in one activity of daily living (Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, ADL) and partially dependent in instrumental activities of daily living (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, IADL). The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) showed mild mental impairment and mild depression. Routine biochemical screening revealed a significant hypercalcemia. Parathormon assay and parathyroid scintigram were performed to confirm the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. After treatment of dehydratation and hypercalcemia, parathyroidectomy was performed: a single parathyroid adenoma was found and removed. On discharge the patient was lucid and able to carry out all ADLs and IADLs.",

The neurologic disorders observed, in order of frequency, include 10 cases of motor hemiparesis, 3 cases of unilateral cerebellar syndrome, 1 case of sensory-motor hemiparesis and 1 case showing signs of the involvement of the motor nuclei of the bulb. The recovery of the motor, sensory, cerebellar and brainstem defects was very slow (average duration: 44.25 days; mode: 14 days) in twelve cases. Two patients showed residual neurological signs respectively after 1 and 7 years from the migraine attack. The patients histories indicate classic or common migraine with a relatively high frequency (80% of the patients experienced one or more crises per month). The most of cases (75%) were female patients. The patients, at time of the attack of complicated migraine, had a mean age years of 32. In ten cases first-grade relatives suffered from classic or common migraine; in no case was there any report of associated or complicated migraine among the relatives. In 4 of the 16 cases the CT scan showed an area of hypodensity consistent to the region of the brain expected to be suffering in view of the clinical type of neurological defect. The Authors take into consideration the controversial relation between complicated migraine with slow or incomplete resolution of neurologic signs and focal brain ischemia due to atherothrombotic infarct, pointing out that the present state of knowledge prevents the reaching of final conclusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Bizarre repetitive behaviour may be quite common, with estimates in people and dogs of a prevalence of up to 8%. Whereas these are often considered important indicators of mental health problems in people, in companion animals, many owners view these behaviours as quirky or even amusing features of their pet. However, the absence of self-report also means that the array of repetitive behaviour conditions in companion animals is also much more diverse than in humans and there is a danger of drawing simple analogies between human and non-human animals based on very superficial phenotypic features. For example, the following differentials might be considered for a dog who chases its tail:\r\n •Seizure possibly a primary partial seizure or secondary to a lesion in the brain such as damage to the vestibular system \r\n•Inner ear infection \r\n•Play \r\n•Pain in the tail or lower back due to damage to the nerves (neuralgia), bones or soft tissues \r\n•Pain around the region of the tail including skin inflammation and infections, impacted or infected anal sacs or trauma \r\n•A learned response aimed at attracting owner attention. \r\n•Acute conflict\r\n•Compulsive Disorder \r\n•Stereotypy \r\n\r\nThese explanations are not independent and a dog who starts chasing his tail for one reason may subsequently learn to do it at other times in order to gain attention, or the frequent repetition of the behaviour may potentially result in neurological sensitization and the expression of the behaviour becoming emancipated from its original triggering stimuli. From the simple (and by no means definitive) list of differentials for tail chasing given above it should be obvious that underlying cognition can vary enormously with a given presenting stereotypic behaviour. This presentation considers the value but also limitations of using companion animals as models of human conditions and especially the value of using real world rather than laboratory models.",

      "abstract": "At an estimated cost of almost $50 billion a year, the socioeconomic burden of major depressive disorder is enormous. Although remission has been identified as the key goal of treatment, such treatment must be highly acceptable to patients, predictably effective, and carry minimal adverse effects. The cornerstone of depression management, remission can improve clinical status, functional ability, and quality of life for the patient while lowering utilization costs related to the disease and its comorbidities. Initially, the goals of therapy are to: (1) reduce and ultimately remove all signs and symptoms of the depressive syndrome; (2) restore occupational and psychosocial function to the asymptomatic state; and (3) achieve and maintain remission. Most patients can achieve these goals with the help of antidepressant medications, problem-focused psychotherapy, or a combination of the 2 methods. Following an initial assessment of the patient, treatment of depression has 3 phases: acute, continuation, and maintenance. Although adherence to treatment is crucial to successful treatment of depression, only about 25% to 35% of patients will achieve remission after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment; another 15% to 20% may remain depressed for months or years. Patients who achieve remission are much less likely to relapse than those who do not. Much debate has focused on the relative merits of prescribing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine. Results of a pooled analysis of 8 such comparative studies are presented.",

Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis.

During the first six months after delivery the prevalence of major depression is estimated at 12-13%.w1 The precise time frame for defining postnatal depression has varied across studies, typically from one month to one year after childbirth. In an effort to standardise the terminology, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition, restricted the specifier of postpartum onset to depressive episodes occurring within four weeks of delivery. However, most studies of postnatal depression have continued to use wider time frames, in part because epidemiological studies show that women's heightened vulnerability to depression continues for at least the first six months after childbirth. Postnatal depression must be distinguished from postnatal blues (“baby blues”), a common experience following childbirth, in which new mothers experience lability of mood and tearfulness. This mild and self limiting condition typically disappears two weeks after delivery.\n\nUnfortunately postnatal depression is often overlooked in primary care clinics. In a study of 214 women who brought their children to a general paediatric clinic, 86 reported high levels of depressive symptoms on the psychiatric symptom index. Of these women, only 29% were identified as depressed by the paediatricians.1 The mother's suffering, coupled with the burden that her depression …",

On an average, schizophrenia showed no further change for the worse after a duration of five years, but rather a tendency to improve. The success and limitations of modern therapy were statistically determined. Many recovered schizophrenics continued to do well even without medication and social care. As a rule, schizophrenics had no endocrine pathology and endocrine patients were not schizophrenic. Neither a broken home in childhood nor an upbringing by a schizophrenic parent resulted in any important association with schizophrenia. However, a disturbed relationship with relatives and loved persons was more frequent in the anamnesis of schizophrenic women than of schizophrenic men. Most schizophrenics who had been schizoid before their psychosis had lived in miserable familial conditions.",

Its diagnosis is purely clinical and rests on the sudden occurrence of retention amnesia associated with retrograde amnesia without disturbances in speech or other neurological deficits. The amnesia totally regresses within less than 24 hours. Paraclinical examinations add nothing to the diagnosis. The cause of transient global amnesia is unknown, and the various hypotheses that have been put forward (e.g. epilepsy, transient ischaemia or migraine) have not been confirmed by clinical and epidemiological studies. Despite a low, but real risk of recurrence, the prognosis is perfectly benign, and there is no need for curative or preventive treatment.",

ASD’s time-limited duration (3 days to 1 month) makes it distinct from, but related to, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed after 1 month. Although there are no large-scale, population-based studies of ASD, smaller studies have examined rates of ASD in select populations following a variety of traumatic events. The prevalence of ASD varies widely depending on the type of traumatic event and the population. The highest rates are in victims of sexual assault and violent crime, with more moderate rates in victims of motor vehicle accidents, burns, illness, disaster, war, and terrorism. Female gender, younger age, and a history of prior trauma, PTSD, or other mental health disorders are risk factors for ASD.",

Children with conduct disorders, with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have an elevated risk for antisocial or psychopathic personality disorders in adolescence and adulthood. The presence of comorbid disorders such as substance abuse and schizophrenia have a strong negative predictive value with respect to the course, the prognosis, and the outcome of antisocial and psychopathic disorders. Furthermore, there are substantial gender differences. The rates for spontaneous remission and improvement of antisocial and psychopathic personality disorders are possibly relatively high. In fact, these rates are higher for women than for men. In the fourth decade of life, most of the antisocial and psychopathic personalities are in remission.",

      "title": "Bilateral Anterior Capsulotomy for the Treatment of Refractory Somatic Symptom Disorder: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a form of mental illness that causes one or more distressing somatic symptoms leading to a significant disruption to everyday life, characterized by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to these symptoms. While SSD is characterized by significant discomfort in some parts of the body, these symptoms are not related to any known medical condition and therefore it cannot be diagnosed using any medical instrument examination. Currently available treatments for SSD, including drug therapy and psychotherapy (such as cognitive behavioral therapy), usually improve psychiatric symptoms, but the results are often disappointing. Furthermore, SSD is often comorbid with anxiety and depression (75.1 and 65.7%, respectively). Importantly, interventions targeting the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC; e.g., deep brain stimulation and thermal ablation) can effectively treat various mental disorders, such as refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and eating disorders, suggesting that it may also be effective for treating the depressive symptoms associated with SSD comorbidity. In this report, a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with SSD accompanied with depression and anxiety underwent bilateral anterior capsulotomy. The patient complained of nausea and vomiting, swelling of the hilum of the liver for 14 years, weakness of the limbs for 13 years, and burning pain in the esophagus for 1 year. Psychiatric and neuropsychological assessments were conducted to record the severity of the patients' symptoms and the progression of postoperative symptoms. The patient's somatization, depression, and anxiety symptoms as well as quality of life improved significantly and steadily; thus, anti-depressive and anti-anxiety medication were stopped. However, the patient developed new somatization symptoms, including dizziness, headache, and sternal pain, 10 months after the operation. Therefore, the patient resumed taking flupentixol and melitracen in order to control the new symptoms. This study shows that bilateral anterior capsulotomy appears to be a complementary treatment for refractory SSD with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, postoperative use of anxiolytic and antidepressant medications may be useful for controlling future somatization symptoms.",

The diagnosis is established after other causes of anisocoria have been excluded. The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of benign episodic mydriasis of her right pupil in a 23-year-old female patient. The episodes lasted for 5-10 minutes and occurred spontaneously, without any concomitant symptoms or precipitating factors. The frequency of the episodes was variable, but she reported that it worsened in periods when she felt more mentally stressed or anxious. Contact with any kind of medications, homoeopathic drugs, industrial agents, or any other kind of chemical compounds was excluded, and the remaining neurological and systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood tests were taken and imaging was performed, which ruled out a structural lesion. A diagnosis of isolated benign episodic mydriasis was established. Unlike the typical presentation of the condition, the episodes did not occur in association with any form of migraine or headache. Given the benign nature of the condition, no treatment was instituted. After excluding potentially severe causes, and reassuring the patient, the frequency of the episodes decreased.",

Se incluyo prospectivamente a todos los pacientes con una o mas crisis epilepticas no provocadas (n = 827). Se investigo el pronostico y las caracteristicas clinicas de cinco grupos de pacientes, definidos segun la presencia de punta-onda centrotemporal (POCT) y de los siguientes signos: bloqueo del habla o disartria, contracciones tonicas o clonicas hemifaciales y sialorrea prominente.

La diferencia entre los grupos A y D fue estadisticamente significativa. \nConclusion. Los casos del grupo A podrian considerarse como casos bien definidos de EIPCT; los casos de los grupos B, C y E, como casos probables, y los del grupo D deberian excluirse del diagnostico.",

The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression as well as scales measuring impairment in activities of daily living, intellectual functioning, and social functioning were administered. The patients' CT scans were also examined.Seventeen patients had major depression and two had minor depression. The presence of left dorsolateral frontal lesions and/or left basal ganglia lesions and, to a lesser extent, parietal-occipital and right hemisphere lesions was associated with an increased probability of developing major depression. Compared to the nondepressed group, the group with major depression had a higher frequency of previous psychiatric disorder and showed evidence of poorer social functioning.Major depression occurs in about one-quarter of patients after traumatic brain injury. This is the same frequency as in other major disorders such as stroke. Major depression appears to be provoked by one or more factors that include poor premorbid social functioning and previous psychiatric disorder or injury to certain critical brain locations.",

Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

OAB may be idiopathic or may occur with other common conditions such as bladder outlet obstruction, neurological disease, or stress incontinence. Primary care physicians may safely diagnose this condition by history and physical exam with a minimum of widely available lab tests. Management with behavioral therapies and pharmacotherapy is generally quite successful and warranted. Multiple anticholinergic medications are available and have been shown to be effective. Subtle differences in structure and mechanism of these agents may yield improved therapeutic benefit or tolerability and thus it is reasonable to try more than one drug to achieve the optimal results. For patients that fail behavioral and initial pharmacotherapy or when other complicating conditions are identified, referral to a specialist is indicated; however, the majority of patients with OAB do not require cystoscopy or urodynamics. Successful treatments for OAB do exist and it is worth screening for these disabling complaints at the primary care level.",

      "title": "Is musical hallucination an otological phenomenon? a review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Musical hallucination is the subjective experience of hearing music, or aspects of music, when none is being played, and as such is a disorder of the processing of complex sounds. Objective of Review: To determine the extent to which the otological system is responsible for musical hallucination, and to evaluate approaches to clinical management. Type of Review: A review of all studies and literature reviews pertaining to musical hallucination, supplemented by inclusion of informative case reports. Search Strategy: A systematic search of multiple databases carried out on 22nd March 2009 was complemented by referral to the reference lists of included manuscripts. Results: Although not always troublesome in itself, musical hallucination can be a marker of underlying pathology in the ear or brain, or indicate obsessive‐compulsive traits or social isolation, and is likely to be clinically underreported. Associations have been reported with hearing loss, female gender, social isolation and being over 60 years of age, although it is rare even in this group, and these may well not be independent risk factors. Robust comparative analysis of these factors with controls has yet to be undertaken. Underlying causes include neurovascular pathology, psychiatric disorders and opioid medications, however these are absent in the majority of cases. Conclusions: This review supports the proposal that the otological system plays a role in the pathogenesis of musical hallucination. Hearing impairment may act as an initiating factor, and the primary dysfunction is overactivity of auditory association cortex, although an impairment of higher‐level inhibition does also seem necessary. Once underlying sinister causes have been excluded, first line treatment should be explanation of the condition and optimisation of hearing. Medications have a role only in selected patient groups.",

They may also be divided into motor, vocal, or visual stereotypies. Biological mechanisms of stereotypies are unknown but they seem to be related to the basal ganglia or the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits. Stereotypies are frequently found in patients with autistic disorders, intellectual disability, and sensorial deficit disorders. Some neurodevelopmental disorders show specific motor stereotypies, which reinforce the notion of a genetic or neurobiological basis. When necessary, treatment may include behavioral or drug-based approaches.",

The cumulative risk of developing one or more seizures was 33% when the first abnormal EEG was recorded, and increased to about 80% if abnormalities persisted three or more years. Focal spike activity was most persistent in children with retarded development or with organic brain diseases. We conclude that the presence of focal EEG spikes in children without epileptic seizures can be considered epileptogenic, especially if the abnormality is persistent and associated with clinical evidence of organic brain disorder.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Factors Associated with Substance-Related Disorders; Three Stratified Dimensions",
      "abstract": "There are three major dimensional aspects with regard to associations between substance-related disorders (SRD) and psychosocial factors. They are religious/spiritual, job-related, and symptomatic (clinical) factors, each of which strongly affects or modifies the quality of life among SRD patients. Those factors construct a stratum in which each factor correlates with the other. The most fundamental factors are religious/spiritual, and based on their sense of value and morality, legal regulations on relevant substances are enforced. Such legal regulations directly stipulate job environments, in other words, social restriction as the second dimension of psychosocial factors among SRD patients. That is, illicit drug use results in dismissals and difficulty in obtaining new jobs. Since unemployment status is strongly associated with SRD, a vicious cycle is formed between SRD and unemployment. Catastrophic events such as suicide often occur as a result of such negative spiral. Due to these social factors related to substances, somatic symptoms, the final signs directly connected to medical treatments and revealed by SRD patients, might be seriously biased. Such somatic symptoms can be regarded as the third dimension of psychosocial factors surrounding SRD. Negative emotions such as stigmas, prejudices, or feelings of shame concerning one’s mental disorder (including SRD) might prevent patients from showing apparent mental symptoms associated with SRD. Because negative emotions possibly arise on the basis of cultural backgrounds, it is important to take into account the effects of such factors when evaluating and studying the associations between somatic symptoms and SRD. The most important issue for the rectification of health inequality among SRD patients is to sweep away discriminations and prejudices against SRD, but this is difficult since such negative emotions are likely to take root in a religious/spiritual context.",

Since childhood the patient had always been incontinent when coughing, exerting herself, or running. After several operations her symptoms worsened, the incontinence being almost complete and activity entirely precluded. Nocturnal enuresis also appeared. Psychological investigation revealed emotional immaturity after an unhappy childhood with many frustrations. There was no opportunity for deeper psychological treatment and supportive psychotherapy aided by hypnosis for symptom removal was used. The symptoms disappeared, the patient was able to return to social life and was still active 3 years later.",

      "title": "The role of negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia outcome",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

The most common complaints of SD patients include recurrent pain (site and quality vary), conversion (pseudoneurologic) symptoms, nervousness or depression (or both), sexual and marital discord, and, often, menstrual difficulties. Such patients will generally have a history of repeated hospitalization or surgery. These symptoms are not perceived as mild or unimportant but lead to physician consultation, prescription drug use, and modification of life-style. Such patients are prone to \"doctor-shopping\" and self-medication and are at risk for many iatrogenic illnesses. Because they generally are resistant to psychologic explanations for their condition, management aimed at protecting them from the consequences of their behavior is important. A heightened threshold for instituting aggressive diagnostic and treatment procedures is necessary.",

ASD's time-limited duration (two days to one month) makes it distinct from but related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed after one month. ASD's brief duration has contributed to a dearth of large-scale, population-based studies. Smaller studies have sought to determine rates of ASD after specific events in select populations; others have focused on ASD's role in predicting PTSD. Much can be learned from existing epidemiological studies. ASD's prevalence varies from 3% in a population of accident victims to 59% in female sexual assault victims. Female gender is a key risk factor; marital status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status have also been associated with ASD in some studies. Comorbidities include depressive and anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.",

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

This focuses on 9 areas of inquiry: the circumstantial lethality of the event; prior self-destructive behavior; depression; hostility; stress; reaction of the parent or parent surrogate; loss of communication; lack of resources; and extremes of parental expectations and control. Adolescents under severe familial and socioeconomic stress, and with a history of acting-out behavior, often respond well to transfer to a more favorable home situation. In cases where there is no apparent familial perturbation, the physician should be alert to the possibility of severe psychiatric disorder.

      "title": "Primary fibromyalgia syndrome: A new holistic approach [abstract]",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) is a psychogenic form of rheumatism characterized by nonspecific persistent chronic pain for at least six months at the trigger points (8 to 30 Trigger Points), short-term memory loss, difficulty concentrating, morning muscle rigidity, restless leg syndrome, cramps, neuro-vegetative disturbance, weakness, change in sleep pattern, anxiety, reactive depression, functional colopathy disturbance, sexual disturbance, persistent low-grade fever, interstitial cystitis, postural instability with vertigo and tinnitus. They present: a)viral etiology from: Epstein-Barr virus with pyscho-somatic substrate. b)Immune factors: inflammatory cytokine IL-1, T.N.F. alpha. c)Organic etiology: alteration of biochemical and morphological markers, metabolic oxidative stress. d)Psychological or traumatic stress : anxiety, reactive depression, panic attacks whiplash. e)Environmental factors : change in electromagnetic fields, geopathic stress, pesticide poisoning with multiple chemical syndrome, mercury poisoning. f)Dietary factors : presence of glutamate in food. g)Gulf war syndrome : 30% of soldiers develop P. F. S. MATERIAL and METHODS: The patient is evaluated from a psychological point of view (psychological trauma), associated with the use of Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Naltrexone hydrocloride low dose and Cell Food-S-Adenosin Methionine. With additional therapies : Mineralogram , Chelation Therapy , Viral Seriology with Labò Live , Micro-immunotherapy (with homeopathic interleukin), Dr. Pierpaoli protocol with the use of vitamins A, D, E, C, Melatonin, Glutathione, Ubiquinone. Protocol: -Infiltration of the Trigger Points, mix of oxygen-ozone (O2O3) concentration 15-10 mcgrg/mL in cycles assessed with the Kinesiology Test (K.T.) -Minor Autohemotherapy (PAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Major Autohemotherapy (GAET) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) -Rectal insufflation (R.I.) : concentration 20-15-10 mcgr/mL in cycles (K.T.) From 1988 to 2017, I have treated 900 cases with this method, with the following results : significant symptom remission in the secondary form in around 60-70% of patients treated with infiltration of the Trigger Points and PAET. In more resistant cases, I have used homotoxicology, psychological counseling, Dr. Pierpaoli protocol and micro-immunotherapy RESULTS: These method results in good symptom remission in 50-60% of the cases treated. CONCLUSIONS: In the multi-factor genesis of PFS, an early diagnosis is important to prevent the pain occurring alongside psycho-somatic disturbances, which lead the subject into a reactive-depressive state. In the complex symptom variety, the obtained percentage results have improved with this additional method, as, by alleviating the symptoms, you assure a better quality of life for the patient.",

This rate increases to 67% after ≥4 trials with different classes of antidepressants (Rush et al., 2006). However, non-response (<50% improvement of symptom-severity) occurs frequently and is associated with prolonged suffering by patients and their family members, but also prolonged hospitalisations and increased suicide-rates.",

      "title": "Testosterone Deficiency and Mood in Aging Men: Pathogenic and Therapeutic Interactions",
      "abstract": "AbstractIn contrast to women, men do not experience a sudden cessation of gonadal function comparable to menopause. However, there is a progressive reduction in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) function in aging men: testosterone (T) levels decline through both central (pituitary) and peripheral (testicular) mechanisms and there is a loss of the circadian rhythm of T secretion. In cohorts of men 75 years of age, mean plasma T levels are 35% lower than comparable young men, and more than 25% of men over 75 appear to be T-deficient. Such age-associated T deficiency, which has been termed 'andropause', is thought to be responsible for a variety of symptoms experienced by elderly men, such as weakness, fatigue, reduced muscle and bone mass, impaired haematopoiesis, oligospermia, sexual dysfunction, depression, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and memory impairment. However, it has been difficult to establish correlations between these symptoms and plasma T levels. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that T replacement leads to symptom relief, particularly with respect to muscle strength, bone mineral density and haematopoiesis. Studies to date on the specific association between psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood, and T levels have been methodologically flawed. Overall, data suggest that although hypogonadism is not central to major depressive disorder (MDD), HPG hypofunction may have aetiological importance in mild depressive conditions, such as dysthymia.Key Words: andropausetestosterone deficiencydepressionmalegeriatric Additional informationNotes on contributorsStuart N SeidmanJoyce Laing works in the Department of Child and Family Psychiatry, Playfield House, Cupar, Fife, and is a Consultant Art Therapist to Psychiatric Hospitals and Prisons and Chairwoman of the Scottish Society of Art and Psychology.Dr Niculescu Dan, Centrul de Reumatologie, Str.

It is often referred to in the literature as “transverse myelitis” or “acute transverse myelitis”. Myelopathy and by extension myelitis, can present as pyramidal (motor), sensory, and/or autonomic dysfunction to varying degrees. Symptoms typically develop over hours to days and worsen over days to weeks. Sensory symptoms usually present as paresthesia ascending from the feet with or without back pain at or near the level of the myelitis. A cervical level focal myelitis can present as sensory symptoms restricted to the feet without ascending extension. Motor symptoms often include weakness that preferentially affects the flexors of the legs and the extensors of the arms (pyramidal distribution of weakness) and can include sphincter dysfunction. This is the case of a 55 years old female patient who develops sudden onset abdominal abscess one year after bariatric surgery that was complicated by an extensive infectious myelitis and cerebral abscesses without any cerebral symptoms. She received adequate antibiotherapy treatment with good evolution. This case is among the first in the medical literature that has occurred one year after bariatric surgery complicated by an abdominal and cerebral abscesses, and extensive infectious myelitis. We discussed all types of myelitis including, the autoimmune and the infectious origin. We showed the progressive evolution by showing MRI sequences. We emphasized about the importance of rapid initiation of the antibiotherapy as well as adding glucocorticoids.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alpha‐mannosidosis is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability (ID), moderate to severe neurosensory hearing loss, frequent infections, psychomotor disturbances and skeletal dysmorphism. For the first time, a panel of nine alpha‐mannosidosis patients with psychiatric symptoms is presented. The clinical picture has several similarities: a physical or psychological stressor precedes a rapid development of a state of confusion, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety and often depression leading to a severe loss of function. This usually lasts 3–12 weeks, and is followed by a period of somnolence and asthenia. It may be more prevalent in females. In four of the described patients search for organic causes of the syndrome was performed, but revealed only negative findings. Because of the limited number of cases no firm conclusion about the benefit of various psychotropic drugs can be drawn from our observation. Psychiatric symptoms could affect as many as 25% of patients with alpha‐mannosidosis. First onset is typically in late puberty to early adolescence. The episodes may be recurrent, and of limited duration although medication may be necessary to alleviate symptoms. Our observations indicate that alpha‐mannosidosis is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms. These should not be dismissed as part of the ID but should give rise to the initiation of adequate diagnostic work‐up, treatment and support.",

We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Restless legs syndrome (RLS) or Ekbom syndrome is characterized by abnormal and unpleasant sensations (paresthesias or dysesthesias) involving the lower extremities that become apparent or worsen at rest, especially in the evening at bedtime, and are relieved, at least transiently, with movement. Sensations often involve both legs but can be unilateral or may alternate between lower extremities. Common complaints include a sensation of creeping, crawling, tingling, wormy, throbbing, pulling, burning, or increased “tension” located deep within the legs (rather than affecting the skin superficially) when sitting or lying down. Some patients are simply unable to describe adequately the sensation they feel. Although symptoms are typically not described as painful, a complaint of pain does not exclude the diagnosis. These uncomfortable sensations extend from the feet and ankle proximally to the legs and, occasionally, thighs. Similar sensations have also been described in the arms. Symptoms tend to occur at night, although unpleasant sensations may emerge during the daytime during prolonged periods of immobility (eg, airplane flights). There is often an accompanying irresistible urge to move the limbs (motor restlessness) to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Less frequently, an isolated urge to move is present without any accompanying unpleasant sensations.",

Its main symptoms are tremor at rest muscle stiffness and bradykinesia, i.e. slowness of movement (the so-called parkinsonian triad). Atrophic lessons of substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, responsible for the production of dopamine, contribute to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Patients with Parkinson’s diseases suffer from a variety of extra-motor symptoms often psychiatric disorders, especially panic or generalized anxiety. The author presents the case of 63 years old man diagnosed with Parkinson’s diseases 4 years ago, with quite a significant severity in the last 2 years. Left limb weakness (upper and lower) deepened and general slowing of movement developed then restless legs syndrome developed fully (specific sensations in the area of the feet and lower legs in the evening and night hours, temporarily decreasing when moving, walking, stretching the muscles). For about 6 months he have had attacks of anxiety and anxiety as well as a fully developed generalized anxiety disorder. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa and pregabalin was used, resulting in a reduction of slowness and stiffness as well as a significant reduction in anxiety and anxiety after approximately 8 weeks.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "Aging is a universal biologic process characterized by a progressive, predictable, inevitable evolution and maturation of an organism until death. The increasing biomedical and psychosocial uniqueness of the elderly requires an individualized approach to their care. The conventional disease-specific approach is not optimal for elderly patients for several reasons. First, people aged 75 years suffer from 3~4 chronic diseases on average. Second, many distressing symptoms or impairments among elderly patients, such as pain, dizziness, fatigue, sleep problems, sensory impairments, and gait disorders cannot be ascribed to a single disease: instead, they result from the accumulated effects of physical, psychological, social, environmental, and other factors. Third, elderly patients vary in the importance they place on potential health outcomes. Three factors at least affect the clinical presentation in elderly patients: underreporting symptoms and impairments, changes in the patterns of presentation of individual illnesses, and an altered spectrum of health conditions. Clinical decision-making is further complicated in these patients because other persons, including the spouse, grown-up children, other relatives, and significant others, are often actively involved, particularly when the patient has cognitive impairment. The physician should understand clinical perspectives of aging and clinically relevant differences between young and old patients, including how elderly individuals behave when they are ill and how to interpret a changing constellation of multiple disease possibilities and interrelationships.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor:—Geriatricians have become expert in the diagnosis and the treatment of several age-related “syndromes” such as falls, confusion, and hypothermia. I would like to describe a syndrome which geriatricians frequently encounter but which, heretofore, has been inadequately characterized. The syndrome I am referring to is “paralysis metu” (Latin for paralyzed by fear). It affects males and females equally with a peak incidence in the third and fourth decades of life. Those individuals with professional degrees and who are licensed are most susceptible. This condition is exclusive to health care professionals practicing in the long-term-care arena, specifically those in nursing facilities. Onset of the disease is gradual and is usually not seen without 6–12 months of exposure to the nursing home environment and participation in at least one state survey. Symptomatology early in the course of disease is subtle and often takes the form of indecision. In its full form, the syndrome is characterized by a refusal to consider new ideas or initiate programs not previously described or sanctioned by the Health Department. Those afflicted have a unique form of aphasia, wherein words such as innovation, progress and risk-taking are lost from the lexicon. Individuals afflicted with this syndrome are “paralyzed by fear,” wary of any actions that might attract review by a regulatory agency. The ability to approach problems rationally and discern fact from fiction is lost completely in the final stages. Fortunately, the incidence of “paralysis metu” has waned over the past few years, coincident with increased attention being given to nursing home resident rights and to outcomes of care impacting directly on quality of life. Clusters of the disease, however, have been reported in certain regions of the country, raising the specter of transmissibility by unknown mechanisms. Treatment, particularly when initiated early, is straightforward and usually highly successful. Education regarding the difference between statutes, regulations, and interpretive guidelines is key, as is a realization that whatever is beneficial to the nursing home resident is probably worthwhile in and of itself.1 With time and a greater emphasis on incentives to improve care, the syndrome of “paralysis metu” will, hopefully, be relegated to history.",

      "abstract": "The reporting of physical symptoms is influenced to a large degree by psychological processes. Individuals are more likely to notice subtle sensations in environments lacking in stimulation than those demanding external attention. The beliefs or schemas that people hold dictate where and how they attend to their bodies as well. These normal perceptual processes help explain why people are often poor at accurately detecting internal physiological activity. Several individual differences are also related to the symptom reporting process. Females are more likely to base their symptom reports on external situational cues than are males. In addition, individuals with chronic anxiety--those high in Negative Affectivity (NA)--report more symptoms than those low in NA. Finally, individuals, who have had traumatic experiences, either in childhood or within 1-6 months prior to a major symptom reporting episode, tend to be high symptom reporters. Several recommendations are made to help researchers and clinicians distinguish between psychological or perceptual factors with presumed biological effects. One implication of this work is that MCS and allied syndromes should be viewed as both a mental and a physical health problem.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are often complicated by psychological and behavioural disturbances. Alzheimer’s disease is not free from such psychiatric complications. Alzheimer’s disease is most frequently the cause of dementia, and the prevalence and incidence of depressive symptoms are high. The prevalence is 40%, half of which are clinically significant and require treatment. When these depressive symptoms occur, they are often associated with other behavioural disturbances such as anxiety, irritability, delusions or apathy. Antidepressants are widely used in Alzheimer’s disease, and they are still prescribed primarily for the management of affective disorders, even though they may be effective in other psychological and behavioural problems. Longitudinal study design and survival analysis are rare. These studies identified functional decline, sleep disturbances and confrontational and aggressive behaviours as the principal predictors of the onset of depressive symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. These findings confirm that it is important to look for psychiatric symptoms such as depression when non-specific behavioural disturbances such as confrontation or aggressiveness occur. Neuropsychiatric symptoms during the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and of Alzheimer’s disease in particular, offer an exciting area of research. We should consider the biological C.

The urologist becomes involved in the treatment of these patients by the natural expression of the symptoms. The underlying psychogenic factor does not become evident until urodynamic investigations and often specific therapeutic steps have been undertaken. The urologic treatment sometimes appears helpful because the patients do not realise or refuse to accept the idea of a psychogenic cause and expect relief from the urologist.

At the very least, these depressive symptoms should be viewed as a cause of significant and treatable \"excess disability\" (Kramer and Reifler, 1992). Demented patients with clinically significant depression (e.g., depressed mood, significant loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and agitation) should be considered for a trial of antidepressant therapy, even when they fail to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression. These symptoms will, in most instances, respond to antidepressant therapy. The \"rules\" for treatment of depression in dementia are slightly different than for cognitively intact patients: (a) start low, go slower, (b) pay attention to cognitive toxicity of all medication combinations, and (c) depressive symptoms do not persist as long as in cognitively intact patients. Current treatments, especially those SSRI's like fluoxetine and sertraline that have cognitive enhancing effects, should be considered the \"first line\" antidepressants. We need to emphasize early detection and treatment of depressive symptoms in dementia in all arenas.",

Its etiology is still unclear, and the clinical presentation is quite heterogeneous, manifesting itself through obsessions and/or compulsions that are associated with high levels of anxiety and time consumption. Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities. Conclusion It is essential to implement strategies for effective communication between both medical specialities, and aim to prevent occupational risks, by protecting and promoting healthy workplaces.

People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

      "abstract": "Four syndromes comprise the absence epilepsies. Each is classically associated with the absence seizure, although other syndromes also have absence attacks as part of their repertoire. The most common syndrome is childhood absence epilepsy; it usually occurs in the age range of 6–7 years. The absence seizures may occur many times daily, and the electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics are the most typical of the absence epilepsies. The second form of absence epilepsies is juvenile absence epilepsy; it begins near puberty and may represent a continuum from the childhood form. Myoclonic seizures are more common than in the childhood form, and the spike‐wave discharges in the EEG are often faster than that seen in childhood absence epilepsy. The third form of absence epilepsy is juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, characterized especially by myoclonic jerks in the morning; these attacks occasionally progress to generalized tonic‐clonic seizures. The final form of absence epilepsy is epilepsy with myoclonic absences, a rare disorder with a specific form of absence seizures. The absence seizure itself is observed to a greater or lesser extent in all of these syndromes. This seizure is a curious event, and its causes are poorly explained by current knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of the epilepsies. Although the etiology of the absence seizure at a biochemical level is unknown, some studies suggest that certain low‐threshold calcium ion currents (T currents), which are partially controlled by GABA‐B mechanisms, may activate burst firing of thalamic neurons, initiating an absence seizure. The evidence of a genetic predisposition for the absence epilepsies is overwhelming. Although the nature of the genetic abnormality remains unclear, promising investigations may soon reveal the location and the nature of the genetic defect.",

Distribution of depression scores revealed three patient groups: very few depressive symptoms (51%), minor depression (27%), and major depression (22%). Major depression was associated with substantially greater impairment in ADL, worse nonmood behavioral disturbance (such as aggression), and more frequent serious wandering, even after adjusting for severity of dementia or comorbid health problems. Minor depression was also associated with nonmood behavioral disturbance and wandering. The authors conclude that both major and minor depression are common in AD and produce considerable mood and nonmood morbidity affecting both patients and caregivers.

The presence of seizure discharges in the limbic portions of the tem­ porallobes leads to a global hyposexuality in the majority of cases. The dis­ appearance of these epileptic potentials-either postoperatively, after fits, or during control with anticonvulsant therapy-sometimes leads to normali­ zation of the sexual drive and sometimes to hypersexual episodes. 2. Temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by a severe disturbance of paroxysmal behaviour: a disordered sexuality with inability to experience an orgasm, and an increase in impulsive irritability with a tendency towards outbursts of anger and rage. 3. One can oppose the limbic excitatory syndrome with its hypo­ sexuality and episodic hyperaggressiveness to the limbic depression syn­ drome with its tendency towards hypersexuality and tame behaviour. The latter corresponds to the Kluver-Bucy syndrome. At the level of the limbic system there may be a reciprocal inhibition of the bias towards sex and towards aggression. 4. Attempts at treating the limbic excitatory syndrome -i.e. the exces­ sive irritability of some temporal lobe epileptics-with a progesterone com­ pound appear promising.",

      "abstract": "• De Clérambault focused attention on a syndrome in which a woman has the delusional belief that a man, usually of higher social status and considerably older, is much in love with her. If the patient's romantic ideas shaped private fantasies instead of determined public behavior, there would be little cause for concern. The situation becomes critical when the fantasies are dramatized in real life with an unsuspecting and usually unwilling man cast in the role of the lover. The woman dwells on the feelings she ascribes to her \"suitor.\" Such delusional thinking, resulting from an ego defect and producing bizarre actions, may be shaped largely by feelings of being unloved or even unloveable; a narcissistic blow is overcome by a grandiose fantasy. Cases in which erotomania is prominent are usually diagnosed as paranoid state or paranoid schizophrenia.",

It is unclear whether the frequency of these disorders increases or decreases with age. Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important. Psychiatric disorders, common among the elderly, have consequences that include social deprivation, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, disability, increased risk for somatic disorders, suicide, and increased nonsuicidal mortality.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "title": "Comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock, is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frightening/scary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened. PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

      "title": "Treatment of premature ejaculation",
      "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual disorder, and it may have a profound negative impact on a man and his partner's lives. Different organizations and societies have no consensus on the definition and classifications of PE. However, most organizations and societies include in their definitions the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), the control of ejaculation, and the distress or impact of interpersonal difficulties. Evaluation procedures have been standardized in clinical studies by the development of an objective measurement of IELT (using a stopwatch) and by the introduction of patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires on ejaculation control and sexual satisfaction. The identification of four different patterns of PE—lifelong, acquired, normal variant, and premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction—is critical because of different underlying pathogeneses and consequently different management approaches. The optimal treatment for PE should be individualized, based on a patient's symptoms, expectations, and underlying variant causes. Most lifelong PE patients need pharmacotherapy (possibly in combination with psychosexual counseling) as a first-line treatment because of the underlying neurobiological etiology and the impact of PE on the couple's relationship. The management of acquired PE is etiologically specific and may include pharmacotherapy for erectile function management in men with comorbid erectile dysfunction (ED). Men with natural variable PE complain of early ejaculation in situational or coincidental conditions; the ejaculation is inconsistent and occurs irregularly. Psychoeducation and reassurance are indicated for men with this type of PE. Psychotherapy or sex counseling is the first choice of treatment for men with premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction. All pharmacotherapies such as long-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or on-demand topical anesthetics are off-label indications, The benefits of pharmacotherapy toward improving ejaculation times should be weighed against their safety profiles. The development of the short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dapoxetine hydrochloride (30 mg and 60 mg) for oral on-demand use opened a new era of PE treatment. Other potential pharmacotherapies such as tramadol, lidocaine/prilocaine spray, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are still under development. Their safety and efficacy profiles should be further evaluated and supported by additional clinical studies.",

Sleep change, loss of energy, and appetite change were the most common symptoms, and psychomotor change and feelings of worthlessness the least common, in MDE. Loss of energy and sleep change were the best single symptoms and thoughts of death, feelings of worthlessness, and psychomotor change the worst for both diagnoses. Psychomotor change was the best and thoughts of death the worst indicator of MDE. Absence of sleep change and of loss of energy were the best and absence of thoughts of death, psychomotor change, and feelings of worthlessness the worst indicators of non-MDE. Results suggest that vegetative symptoms are more central to clinical depression than feelings of worthlessness, self-reproach, or guilt.",

The fantasy of anal penetration played a major role for this particular patient. This specific fantasy, however, is regarded as idiosyncratic and not necessarily relevant to the precipitation of seizures in any other individual. The critical factor which may be applicable to other cases appears to be a situation in which there is no other available resolution to intense mutually incompatible feelings.",

      "abstract": "Akute Agitation und Aggression zählen mit einer Prävalenz mit über 10 % zu den häufigsten medizinischen Notfallsituationen in der Psychiatrie [1]. Fast jeder zweite Patient, der in eine psychiatrische Notaufnahme kommt, weist Symptome von Agitation auf. Im deutschsprachigen Raum wird unter Agitation in der Regel ein Syndrom verstanden, das durch psychomotorische Unruhe, Erregung und Gespanntheit gekennzeichnet ist und das von stillem Negativismus bis hin zur Hostilität reichen kann [2]. Diese können in wechselnder Ausprägung und in der Intensität rasch veränderlich vorliegen. Häufig wird weitgehend synonym, aber doch mit etwas anderem Schwerpunkt der Begriff (psychomotorischer) Erregungszustand verwendet, der vor allem durch eine ausgeprägte Antriebssteigerung sowie motorische Hyperaktivität gekennzeichnet ist. Sowohl Agitation als auch psychomotorischer Erregungszustand können schließlich mit Gereiztheit, Aggressivität und Kontrollverlust einhergehen. In der angloamerikanischen Literatur wird Agitation dagegen besonders durch ausgeprägte motorische oder verbale Hyperaktivität oder durch Reizbarkeit und unkooperatives Verhalten charakterisiert [3], ein Bild, das eher dem (psychomotorischen) Erregungszustand nach deutschem Verständnis entspricht. Konkrete Anzeichen von Agitation sind z. B. motorische Unruhe, Hin-und-Her-Gehen, intensives Gestikulieren, laute Sprache mit Drohgebärden, Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität sowie mangelnde Kooperation. Die Übergänge zwischen Agitation und Aggression sind fließend. Mündet Agitation in Aggression, kann sich daraus eine akute Gefährdung des Patienten oder seines sozialen Umfelds entwickeln [4]. Aggression umfasst jegliche Form von verbalem, nonverbalem oder körperlichem Verhalten, das für den Patienten selbst, für andere Personen oder für deren Eigentum bedrohlich ist. Agitiertes Verhalten führt häufig zu Aggression und Gewalt. Bei psychiatrischen Patienten wird in bis zu über 80 % der Gewaltdelikte agitiertes Verhalten beobachtet. Insbesondere unbehandelte, junge, männliche Patienten mit Psychosen gelten als Hochrisikogruppe, vor allem, wenn komorbider Substanzmissbrauch hinzukommt [5].",

      "title": "403 - Episodes of lucidity (paradoxical lucidity): A survey of family caregivers of persons with dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract: People with late-stage Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) who are assumed to have lost coherent cognitive capacity may exhibit unexpected episodes of spontaneous, meaningful, and relevant communication or behavior. Most reports of paradoxical lucidity or “episodes of lucidity” (EL) are anecdotal or case studies. Given the transient nature and lack of scientific explanation of the phenomenon, EL is under-investigated and poorly understood. To develop an operational definition of and typologies for EL, we conducted a pilot study of former and current family caregivers from UsAgainstAlzheimer’s A-LIST® (N = 480). Over sixty percent of caregivers (n = 294, 61%) reported witnessing at least one EL with their care recipient over the course of dementia. Most episodes happened in late stages of dementia (71%). Only 10% happened within 7 days before death. The majority of episodes (71%) lasted &lt;30 minutes. About half the episodes were characterized by uncharacteristic speech and communication. Caregivers perceived these experiences positively ( M = 4.1; range = 1–5), but also expressed desire to know why/when EL occurs and how to respond to it. We plan to use these data to refine definitions and typologies to incorporate into a prospective, demographically diverse survey to family caregivers to assess predictors of EL and linking EL to caregiver well-being and bereavement response. Precise and robust operationalizations of EL will allow future research to assess if EL has different effects on ADRD prognosis or alters how family members understand, manage and adapt to a PLWD’s dementia progression.",

The other symptoms include decreased interest in usual activities, poor concentration, fatigue, increased appetite, change in sleep, a sense of being overwhelmed or out of control, and physical symptoms such as breast tenderness. The symptoms must be present in the luteal (premenstrual) phase of the menstrual cycle, must resolve during the first few days of menses, and must have been present for at least 1 year. The symptoms should be severe enough to disrupt social and role functioning. The DSM-IV PMDD criteria include the recommendation that women prospectively rate their symptoms daily for two menstrual cycles to confirm the timing of the symptoms and the absence of a chronic underlying Axis I disorder. Many studies have identified irritability as the most frequently reported premenstrual symptom. It has been proposed that women with PMDD may comprise two subsets; one with predominant depressive symptoms, and another with predominant irritability.",

While the disorder as seen in the clinic is much less common in males than females this may not be a true reflection of the differential sex or overall prevalence rates. The disorder is found to have the same basic characteristics in the male as in the female: namely, a phobic avoidance of normal weight associated with elective carbohydrate starvation and emaciation. As in the female the mechanism appears to develop out of normal adolescent dieting behaviour and to arise as a means of avoiding overwhelming psychosocial maturational demands of adolescence. Premorbid and family features include a state of overnutrition and a high degree of family psychopathology reflected in high rates of parental psychiatric morbidity and marital difficulty.",

      "title": "[Hypothyroidism--clinical findings, diagnosis, therapy. Thyroid tests should be performed on broad indications].",
      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical entity resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones or, more rarely, from their impaired activity at tissue level. It is a common condition, with a prevalence of 1.9 per cent in women, and the prevalence increases with age. Hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired, primary or secondary, chronic or transient. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by disease or treatment which destroys the thyroid gland or interferes with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is the predominant cause of primary hypothyroidism in countries such as Sweden where severe iodine deficiency is non-existent. Another cause of primary hypothyroidism, chronic or transient, is previous radio-iodine or surgical treatment of hypothyroidism. In secondary or central hypothyroidism, which is very rare, there is a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH activity, due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. The clinical features of hypothyroidism are dependent on the patient's age, the presence of other disease, and the rate at which hypothyroidism develops. As thyroid hormones are universal determinants of organ function, there may be a multiplicity of symptoms. Particularly in the elderly, the clinical features may be atypical, and the diagnosis easily missed. First line tests for hypothyroidism are analyses of the concentrations of free thyroxine (T4) and TSH in serum. In primary hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH high. In central hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH generally low or normal, though slightly increased levels of biologically inactive TSH may also occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterised by a normal serum level of T4, an increased level of TSH, and the absence of clinical symptoms. When a diagnosis of chronic hypothyroidism is confirmed, treatment with laevothyroxine is started, the initial dose being adjusted to the age and general condition of the patient, and the duration and severity of hypothyroidism. As a rule, full thyroxine replacement therapy should bring the serum TSH level into the normal range. In central hypothyroidism, laevothyroxine treatment is similar, but pituitary function must be evaluated and, if necessary, corticosteroid replacement be instituted before laevothyroxine treatment is started.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Neurological involvement has been reported in up to 80% of adults with Primary Sjogren’s syndrome (pSS) with psychiatric abnormalities including anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction being common. Psychosis due to pSS has been reported in adult patients but has never been previously reported in the adolescent/pediatric literature. Here we describe for the first time four cases of adolescent Sjogren’s syndrome that presented with psychotic symptoms. Rituximab treatment was followed by improvement of psychiatric symptoms in all patients. Case presentation 1 : 16 year old female without significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with 4 days of abnormal behavior, tremors, insomnia, polyphagia, polyuria, and suicidal ideation. 2 : 16 year old female with a 4 year history of severe anxiety, OCD, and tic disorder treated with fluoxetine with partial benefit presented with an abrupt and severe worsening of anxiety, OCD and new auditory hallucinations. 3 : 19 year old female without significant past medical history presented with a 3 day history of progressively altered behavior, incoherent speech, insomnia, headache, and tangential thoughts. 4 : 17 year old female without significant past medical history presented with new onset suicidal ideation, paranoia, confusion, and emotional lability. Conclusion Psychosis is more common in autoimmune disease than previously known. To our knowledge, the four teenage women described above are the first reported patients with adolescent pSS manifesting as psychosis. pSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of young patients with new psychiatric disorders, even in the absence of sicca symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms improved with rituximab infusions in all 4 of our patients, which suggests rituximab may be an effective treatment option that should be considered early after the diagnosis of pSS-associated psychiatric disturbance.",

      "title": "Severe Hot Flashes Are Associated With Chronic Insomnia",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Because hot flashes can occur during the night, their presence has been frequently associated with insomnia in women with symptoms of menopause. However, many factors other than hot flashes or menopause can be responsible for insomnia, and several factors associated with insomnia in the general population are also commonly observed in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women who have hot flashes. <h3>Methods</h3> A random sample of 3243 subjects (aged ≥18 years) representative of the California population was interviewed by telephone. Included were 982 women aged 35 to 65 years. Women were divided into 3 groups according to menopausal status: premenopause (57.2%), perimenopause (22.3%), and postmenopause (20.5%). Hot flashes were counted if they were present for at least 3 days per week during the last month and were classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to their effect on daily functioning. Chronic insomnia was defined as global sleep dissatisfaction, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or nonrestorative sleep, for at least 6 months. Diagnoses of insomnia were assessed according to the<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i>, classification. <h3>Results</h3> Prevalence of hot flashes was 12.5% in premenopause, 79.0% in perimenopause, and 39.3% in postmenopause. Prevalence of chronic insomnia was reported as 36.5% in premenopause, 56.6% in perimenopause, and 50.7% in postmenopause (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Prevalence of symptoms of chronic insomnia increased with the severity of hot flashes, reaching more than 80% in perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women who had severe hot flashes. In multivariate analyses, severe hot flashes were significantly associated with symptoms and a diagnosis of chronic insomnia. Poor health, chronic pain, and sleep apnea were other significant factors associated with chronic insomnia. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Severe hot flashes are strongly associated with chronic insomnia in midlife women. The presence of hot flashes should be systematically investigated in women with insomnia. Treating hot flashes could improve sleep quality and minimize the deleterious consequences of chronic insomnia.",

Menopozla ilişkili semptomların ana nedeninin kadınlarda östrojen düzeylerindeki kayıptan kaynaklandığına dair kanıtlar vardır. Menopoz genellikle sıcak basması, idrar bozuklukları, eklem ağrısı ve psikolojik sıkıntı gibi çeşitli sağlık şikayetleriyle ilişkilidir. Menopoz semptomlarını bildiren kadınların genel sağlık durumu genellikle daha kötüdür. Menopoz sırasında ve sonrasında birçok kadında depresyon (mutsuzluk, sinirlilik, ağlamaklılık, enerji eksikliği) veya anksiyete (ruh hali değişiklikleri, uykusuzluk, kalp çarpıntısı, panik atak, unutkanlık veya odaklanma ve konsantrasyon sorunları) belirtileri görülmektedir.

The syndrome develops from ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland after severe postpartum hemorrhage. Pituitary apoplexy is an emergent condition consisting of pituitary hemorrhage which can occur in pregnancy or the postpartum period. The most immediate danger to the patient from either emergency is the risk of adrenal crisis as the loss of adrenocorticotropic hormone signal from the pituitary gland to the adrenal glands leads to a sudden deficit of cortisol. Severe, potentially fatal hypotension can ensue. With pituitary necrosis or hemorrhage, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels decline as well and stimulation of thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland becomes negligible. The long half-life of thyroid hormone means that circulating thyroid hormone will decline slowly over time, with symptoms of central hypothyroidism developing over many weeks to months. If left untreated, deficiencies of cortisol and thyroid hormone are fatal. Although Sheehan's syndrome or apoplexy may lead to only partial or mild dysfunction of the pituitary gland, maintaining a high suspicion for central adrenal insufficiency in a pregnant or postpartum woman who remains hypotensive after volume replacement, and treating her appropriately with glucocorticoid replacement, can be life-saving.",

Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

      "abstract": "A child or adolescent perfect health has just suffered a generalized epileptic seizure or typical petit-mal blackouts. Investigations to determine whether there might have been some injury causing brain damage reveal nothing. The child had a normal, full-term birth, with no resuscitation necessary. His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage. This person is then classified as epileptic; and view of the absence of any discernible lesion as cause, the term is qualified by essential or idiopathic. Such designations are certainly open to question. However, they have prevailed, and ought to be retained. They do not indicate that this type of epilepsy has no cause but that, according to the expression of Castaigne (1968), in the case question epilepsy is the very essence of the disease, and",

The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

      "title": "Suicidal ideation in older people, a public health matter",
      "abstract": "Introduction Suicide in older people is a critical public and mental health issue which requires attention, given that the ageing population is increasing. Multiple factors, including biological, psychological, and social stressors increase suicidal susceptibility. Unfortunately, elderly are more susceptible to these, such as psychiatric disturbances, physical comorbidities, prior suicide-related behaviours, lack of social support, grief, and increased difficulty in problem-solving Objectives In order to review the risk and protective factors, assessment and prevention of suicide in older adults. Methods Bibliographic research through PubMed and Web of Science. Results Older people can be subdivided into three age groups (from “young old” at 65 years old to “oldest old” after 85 years of age), with suicide being more prevalent in the oldest-old, and overall in men above 75 years old. Previous psychiatric background, suicidal attempts, substance abuse, poor physical health or disability, family psychiatric history, low social support or isolation, and finantial stress most frequently predispose to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts or death by suicide in this community. Besides this, ageing relates to a tendency to cognitive impairment, which affects coping mechanisms, leading to deficits in reasoning and decision-making under stressful circumstances during depressive episodes. This can mediate suicidal ideation and associates to greater lethality methods. Geriatric suicidal attempters have been shown to have greater degrees of cortical and subcortical cerebral areas, including the frontal, parietal and temporal regions, as well as significant loss of volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insula, midbrain, cerebellum, lentiform nucleus and putamen. Abnormalities in these regions can impair executive and cognitive function, attention, problem solving and ultimately be responsible for suicidal behaviour. On the other hand, there are suicide protective elements such as physical and cognitive fitness, quality of life and life satisfaction, marital status, religiousness and social support. A prompt identification of modifiable risk factors and strengthening the protective ones by health professionals can reduce this prospect. Conclusions Suicidal ideation in older people is a multifactorial public health concern given the very high frequency of completed suicides in this population. Therefore, it is urgent to review and further research to build more effective suicide prevention strategies. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "espanolEl trastorno bipolar es un trastorno mental grave y recurrente de caracter cronico que se caracteriza por oscilaciones del estado de animo con fases de mania, hipomania o mixtas alternadas con episodios depresivos. La prevalencia a lo largo de la vida se estima entre el 1 y 3%, siendo la edad media de debut entre los 18 y 20 anos. Los factores estresantes psicosociales influyen en el comienzo y en las posteriores recidivas dentro de un modelo de vulnerabilidad genetica. Entre los acontecimientos vitales que pueden influir notablemente en el curso de la enfermedad se situan el embarazo y el parto. Son periodos de vulnerabilidad en los que puede acontecer un empeoramiento de los sintomas o incluso una recaida a pesar de existir una buena adherencia terapeutica. El riesgo de recurrencias se incrementa cuando los psicofarmacos se retiran bruscamente. De hecho, hasta un 81-85’5% de gestantes con trastorno bipolar tienen el riesgo de recaer si dejan de tomar estabilizantes del animo. La exposicion al litio durante el primer trimestre se ha relacionado con malformaciones cardiacas en el feto, especialmente la anomalia de Ebstein. El acido valproico y la carbamazepina aumentan el riesgo de defectos en el tubo neural. En cambio, la lamotrigina en monoterapia ha demostrado menor riesgo de malformaciones que otros anticonvulsivantes. Por todo ello, es fundamental valorar el riesgo-beneficio del uso de psicofarmacos, siendo necesario el conocimiento de su uso y elaborar un plan de tratamiento individualizado en cada caso. EnglishBipolar disorder is a recurring and chronic severe mental disorder consisting of mood shifts between manic, hypomanic or mixed phases alternated with depressive episodes. Lifetime prevalence is estimated between 1 and 3%, mean age of debut being between 18 and 20 years of age. Psychosocial stressors influence the onset and subsequent relapses within a model of genetic vulnerability. Among the vital events that can significantly influence the course of the disorder are pregnancy and childbirth. They are periods of vulnerability in which there can be a worsening of symptoms or even a relapse despite having a good therapeutic adherence. The risk of recurrence is increased when psychoactive drugs are withdrawn abruptly; in fact up to 81-85.5% of pregnant women with bipolar disorder have the risk of relapse if they stop taking mood stabilizers. Exposure to lithium during the first trimester has been linked to cardiac malformations in the fetus, especially Ebstein’s anomaly. Valproic acid and carbamazepine increase the risk of neural tube defects. Lamotrigine monotherapy has shown a lower risk of malformations than other anticonvulsants. It is essential to assess the risks and benefits of the use of psychotropic drugs, the knowledge of their use is necessary as is the elaboration of an individualized treatment plan in each case",

BECT satisfied the following criteria: 1) normal intelligence, 2) central and/or mid‐temporal spikes with normal background activities on the interictal EEG recordings, and 3) partial and/or generalized seizures in sleep. The patients were divided into two groups according to the clinical course; P (n = 10): patients with only (n = 6) or predominantly (n = 4) partial seizures, G (n = 10): those with only (n = 7) or predominantly (n = 3) generalized seizures. No difference in the age at onset was noted between the two groups. There were also no indications that the seizures tend to generalize at a younger age or remain partial at an older age. Therefore, age is not important in the evolution of partial to generalized seizures in BECT.",

      "abstract": "The term asthenia comes from the Greek (centsqsneia, a: privation, without; esthénos: vigor, force), it means absence of strength, vigor or force. It is a symptom, difficult to define, with a set of vague sensations, different for each patient. It is a frequent cause of consult, almost 30% in ambulatory settings. The chronic fatigue represents up to 10% of these cases, and the 0.2-0.7% belongs to the chronic fatigue syndrome. It is very important to differentiate asthenia from weakness, dizziness or dyspnoea, since patients may confuse them. The factor time in asthenia is very useful for its characterization, it was defined to the prolonged fatigue when it lasts for more than a month and chronic when the duration is greater than 6 months. The depression is the commonest fatigue cause, representing approximately half of the cases. The most effective treatment of the asthenia is to solve the underlying cause, although up to 20% of the patients remain without diagnosis. The diagnosis of the chronic fatigue syndrome is of exclusion and the criteria of the international consensus of year 1994 are due to use. The high frequency of the symptom entails an enormous social and economic cost and it is for that reason so important for physicians to have a correct manage of this symptom.",

In only 14.5% of cases the pre-manifest period was characterized by personality accentuation. Analysis of cases of the latent course of the disease has made it possible to distinguish three main variants of its clinical manifestations: hypoparanoid, psychopathy-like and neurosis-like. On the basis of these findings a conclusion can be drawn that most of the cases of schizophrenia manifested in old age by the syndrome of involutional paranoid belong to a group of diseases with an early onset, prolonged torpid or latent course, and with increased progression of the process in advanced age.",

      "abstract": "Rehabilitation in psychiatry is still associated with a more complete reestablishing of chronic patients' position in the society. However, early rehabilitation does not seem to resolve all the problems. Social losses and social deterioration are found in more than half of schizophrenic patients already in prodrome phase i.e. before the onset of the first psychotic episode. Further on, every relapse, several months of disease and hospitalizations frequently disrupt education, cause losing jobs and breaking relations, social withdrawal and also disability. Environmental and social factors may facilitate the development of chronic conditions and increasing defect via their interaction with the personality and the disease. Not infrequently the rehabilitation process may lag behind and certain possibilities may be missed. There is also a gap between the rehabilitation concepts and sociopsychological characteristics of specific age groups of psychiatric patients. The author presents the concept of psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) using schizophrenic patients as an example and emphasizes the following aspects: 1) PSR in an essential component of care on every stage that follows treatment, throughout the whole course of disease; 2) psychosocial interventions and social support are aimed at both preserving social capacities of the patient and prevention of social losses in future; 3) complex therapy in combination with consequent psychosocial (both group and individual) patient-centered interventions involving also family and social network of the patient is used along with other methods of social recovery; 4) with regard for the mentioned one can distinguish the most problematic patients groups, specifically: a) those in initial phase of disease (first 5 years), b) patients with frequent hospitalizations, c) those with unstable labor adjustment, d) single persons, e) those staying in hospital too long; and 5) in adolescence and in young age the purpose of rehabilitation is not only winning back the social positions but also restoration of the patient's personality and his social self; while in older age coping with negative effects of getting older and acceptation of new social roles are becoming more important.",

Patient and informant history taking, along with simple additional cognitive tests are usually sufficient to reassure patients or to initiate further diagnostic work-up. Differential diagnoses include depression, delirium, other psychiatric or neurological disorders, metabolic causes, intoxications or side effects of drugs. Physical examination and laboratory tests generally have limited added value. Main reasons for referral are a suspected treatable cause for cognitive decline (e.g. delirium), focal neurological deficit (e.g. stroke), suspected dementia under the age of 65-70 years, additional complex somatic or psychiatric disorders or further work-up in non-native speaking people.",

Alcohol may have significance as a risk factor for the perpetrator (culprit, car driver, etc.), as well as for the victim. This is especially clear in cases of violence and assault. Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose‐response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo‐graphic factors must be taken into account. The populations studied are often selected, e.g., from emergency departments, pathology units (postmortem data), or related to those epidemiological studies based on interviews.

In the non-lateralized cases, onset was bilateral. In the one intermittent case, while her tinnitus was absent her pulsatile tinnitus could be induced by somatic testing. No etiology was found from physical examination, imaging, or ancillary testing. Because these cases of pulsatile tinnitus can be both induced and suppressed by activation of the somatosensory system of the head or upper lateral neck, we propose that this syndrome is occurring from (a) cardiac synchronous somatosensory activation of the central auditory pathway or (b) failure of the somatosensory-auditory central nervous system interactions to suppress cardiac somatosounds.",

All these syndromes are characterized by similar clinical symptomatology of the paroxysmal events. However, the pathophysiology of the choreoathetotic episodes differs considerably. In the first two syndromes the paroxysms are most probably generated by nonepilep-togenic abnormal discharges in the basal ganglia whereas in the third syndrome (supplementary sensorimotor seizures) there is convincing evidence indicating that the pathogenesis is an epileptic process in the cortex.

      "abstract": "Acute telogen effluvium refers to sudden onset of scalp hair loss occurring 2 to 3 months after a triggering event such as a high fever, surgical trauma, sudden starvation, or hemorrhage. While emotional stress is often linked to this condition, evidence supporting this connection is weak, and there is no indication that the stress of daily life alone can cause widespread hair loss. The primary mechanism behind hair loss is the immediate release of anagen hairs. Patients may notice increased hair loss during brushing, combing, or shampooing, with daily losses ranging from under 100 to over 1,000 strands. If shedding occurs at lower rates and for a short duration, baldness may not be apparent, but higher rates can lead to a diffuse reduction in hair density. Spontaneous and complete regrowth typically occurs within 3 to 6 months unless the triggering event is repeated. Abrupt-onset telogen effluvium is often linked to a specific event or trigger 6 to 16 weeks earlier. In acute telogen effluvium, the hair pull test is positive, with normal club hairs, and there is usually a strong positive presence of telogen hairs at the vertex and the scalp margins.[1]",

      "title": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and highly comorbid illness characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry (Box 19- ). It is marked by a later onset than other anxiety disorders (Kessler et al. 2005) and is associated with fluctuations in symptom severity and impairment (e.g., Wittchen et al. 2000). It demonstrates both a low probability of recovery (32%–58%) and a high likelihood of recurrence (45%–52%) (Rodriguez et al. 2006) over a 2- to 12-year period. GAD is associated with significant disability and impairment comparable to pure major depressive disorder (Hoffman et al. 2008) and can be more debilitating than pure substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and personality disorders, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and comorbid conditions (Grant et al. 2005). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder 300.02 F41.1 Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months): Note: Only one item is required in children. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. Being easily fatigued. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. Irritability. Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder). Individuals with GAD attempt to enhance their sense of control or preparedness through anticipation of negative outcomes or worst-case scenarios. They scan their environment for potential danger and negatively interpret neutral or ambiguous stimuli as threatening (Mathews and MacLeod 1994). Because of their lack of present moment focus, these individuals tend to ignore information in their immediate surroundings that could potentially challenge their distorted views (Borkovec and Newman 1998), which triggers emotional distress. This emotional distress is associated with many somatic features, including restlessness, fatigue, irritability, concentration difficulties, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. Overall, GAD is a serious and costly mental illness with regard to degree of distress, disability and subsequent loss of work productivity, and quality of life (Newman 2000). Thus, targeted interventions are necessary to effectively address core symptoms and associated features. In this chapter we discuss several empirically established approaches to treatment for GAD, including conventional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and integrative psychotherapy.",

Two patients had tonic-clonic seizures just before the onset of the status, but none had a history of chronic epilepsy. Three patients had long-standing psychiatric disorders. Treatment with psychotropic drugs and medical illness (vascular disease, metabolic derangement) may have acted as precipitating factors for the status epilepticus in all patients. The diagnosis was never made on admission, since psychiatric history and ictal behavioral manifestations often raised intriguing problems of differential diagnosis. In all cases, only ictal EEG could provide a correct diagnostic assessment.",

      "title": "Investigation des fonctions mnésiques impliquées dans le processus de rémission de l'état de stress post-traumatique",
      "abstract": "L'etude de l'etat de stress post-traumatique (ESPT) amene a se poser deux types de questions fondamentales : 1) pourquoi certains individus exposes a un evenement traumatique developpent le trouble alors que d'autres non? et 2) parmi ceux qui developpent le trouble, pourquoi la majorite des individus entrent en remission apres quelques mois alors que d'autres developpent un ESPT chronique qui persiste pendant plusieurs mois, voire plusieurs annees? La presente these avait donc pour but de trouver certaines explications a cette deuxieme question qui semble plus importante d'un point de vue clinique en raison des repercussions que ce trouble peut avoir sur le fonctionnement quotidien des victimes et de leur entourage. Effectivement, pour certaines victimes, plus le temps passe, plus les symptomes s'installent et se cristallisent. Pour ces individus, les symptomes chroniques et dommageables seraient souvent jumeles a differentes complications, notamment un trouble depressif ou anxieux, un trouble de dependance ou d'abus de substances, un changement au niveau de la personnalite, ainsi qu'a une degradation durable au plan du fonctionnement social et professionnel (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). Il a ete propose que le processus de remission ne requiert pas un oubli, mais reflete plutot un nouvel apprentissage (Foa, 2000) et que les dysfonctions mnesiques (souvenirs recurrents et involontaires du trauma et difficultes a se souvenirs du trauma) observees chez les victimes d'evenements traumatiques pourraient interferer avec la remission du trauma, un processus d'adaptation qui requiert ce nouvel apprentissage par extinction (Shalev, 2000). La these se compose de quatre chapitres. Le premier consiste en une description des modeles theoriques et neuronaux ainsi qu'une recension de la litterature sur les processus mnesiques impliques dans l'ESPT ainsi que les facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux dysfonctions mnesiques retrouvees dans l'ESPT. Cette recension met en evidence la controverse dans la litterature en ce qui a trait a la memoire traumatique ainsi que les principales failles methodologiques qui empechent de repondre au questionnement souleve. Le deuxieme chapitre presente une etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des experiences emotionnelles peritraumatiques (detresse et dissociation vecues au moment du trauma) chez des individus exposes a un evenement traumatique en fonction de leur statut diagnostic. Il etait anticipe qu'en appliquant la theorie d'une relation en « U » inversee entre l'intensite du stress et le systeme mnesique hippocampique (Metcalfe & Jacobs, 1998) et en tenant compte du statut diagnostique, nous pourrions mieux comprendre les resultats contradictoires obtenus jusqu'a maintenant au sujet des souvenirs traumatiques. Les resultats de cette etude ont demontre que le statut diagnostique est associe a la fidelite des souvenirs retrospectifs des reponses peritraumatiques. Ces resultats sont donc en accord avec la theorie de Metcalfe & Jacob (1998) sur la memoire traumatique humaine qui suggere qu'un niveau de stress modere produit un souvenir forme a l'aide de l'hippocampe et est associe avec la memoire episodique, autobiographique et contextuelle, alors qu'un niveau de stress extreme mene a un encodage independant de l'hippocampe, mais associe a l'activation de l'amygdale, menant a la creation d'un souvenir decontextualise, sensoriel et charge emotionnellement. Le troisieme chapitre presente une deuxieme etude qui avait pour but d'examiner, de facon longitudinale, le role des facteurs neurobiologiques sous-jacents aux fonctions mnesiques dans l'evolution des symptomes d'ESPT en etudiant l'implication de certains SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism) du gene FKBP5 dans le processus de remission du trouble. Les resultats ont demontre que le gene FKBP5 pouvait prospectivement predire le manque d'amelioration des symptomes d'ESPT chez des individus ayant recours a une therapie pour un ESPT aigu. Des analyses plus specifiques ont aussi demontre un effet interactif des SNPs du gene FKBP5 et du souvenir subjectif de la severite du trauma (c.-a-d., les reponses peritraumatiques) sur les dysfonctions mnesiques. Les resultats demontrent donc une relation entre les corticosteroides et les performances mnesiques, ce qui pourrait interferer avec l'apprentissage par extinction, et par consequent, en partie expliquer la persistance du trouble. Le dernier chapitre propose une discussion generale des resultats qui permettent de constater que les processus mnesiques sont impliques dans la remission/persistance de l'ESPT. Les differentes forces et limites ainsi que les implications cliniques et theoriques de la presente these sont aussi examinees.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________",

Systemic estrogen therapy is the most effectives treatment strategy for vasomotor symptoms and has been used for nearly 60 years. When menopausal women do not want to take hormone therapy or when it is contraindicated, there are several therapeutic options for hot flashes. For mild hot flashes, lifestyle modification such as lowering body temperature, weight control, exercise and relaxation techniques may have some effects without complication. Nonprescription remedies such as isoflavone, black cohosh and vitamin E have not shown sufficient efficacy in clinical trials. However, short-term application of these remedies might not be associated with serious adverse effects.

Baby blues are characterized by mood lability and sudden crying but most commonly last a few days and then resolve. Up to 70 percent of women experience a few days of baby blues which then resolves completely. Most women with PPD develop symptoms within four weeks of giving birth, though symptoms can occur anytime within the 12 months following delivery. Approximately 15 to 25 percent of women experience PPD following childbirth. Postpartum depression can occur as a result of a live birth, spontaneous abortion, elective termination, or a fetal demise. In the United States 2 million new mothers experience PPD annually. Certain factors reduce the risk of PPD, including adequate social support, regular sleep patterns, and breastfeeding.",

Despite this the development of quality of life research has been rather slow in the field but it is evident both from epidemiological and clinical studies that persons with major depression have a substantially lower subjective quality of life than healthy subjects, and that quality of life is severely affected in a number of life domains as well as associated with a worse functioning in various external life conditions. Subjective quality of life has also mostly been found to be worse than in other psychiatric conditions and equal to or worse than quality of life in several major medical chronic illnesses. Although investigations of quality of life in anxiety disorder are growing they are less frequent than in depression and still in its infancy. This is most evident concerning post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and further studies in all anxiety disorders are strongly needed. The general picture emerging from studies performed is that anxiety disorders are illnesses that impair quality of life and social functioning in a number of life domains. There is some evidence that quality of life is most compromised in panic disorder (PD) and PTSD.",

      "title": "Delusions in Major Depressive Disorder: Recommendations for the DSM-V",
      "abstract": "false negatives and false positives may occur. The presence of the delusions may be actively concealed by the patient (for instance, by a mother who is afraid that she will lose her children if she reveals her delusions), or the patient may be unable to fully recognize or report the presence of delusions because of perplexity, psychic retardation or agitation. On the other hand, the expressions sometimes used by patients when talking about their depressive feelings may be misleading, and some severely depressed patients may endorse the strongest terms used in structured interviews even if these terms do not apply to their particular case: this may generate false positives. Delusions are not included in the DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode, but their presence can be recorded using the specifier ‘severe with psychotic features’, with the possibility to further specify whether the delusions are ‘mood congruent’ or ‘mood incongruent’ [7] . Thus, the DSM-IV seems to make two assumptions: (a) that every delusional depression will also be severe (i.e. characterized by the presence of several symptoms in excess to those required to make the diagnosis, and by a marked interference with social functioning), and (b) that, in an individual depressive episode, delusions will either be all congruent or all incongruent with depressed mood. In fact, it is not possible to record the concomitant presence of both mood-congruent and mood-incongruent delusions. However, some preliminary research evidence seems to question these two assumptions. One study reported that delusions can also be present in deDelusions are a common symptom in major depressive disorder, occurring in about 25% of hospitalized patients and almost 15% of cases in the community [1, 2] . The phenomenology and prognostic significance of delusions in depressed patients are currently being discussed again within the context of the work on the DSM-V [3–6] . According to the DSM-IV [7] , depressive thoughts, in order to be classified as delusions, must fulfill two criteria: (a) the judgment has to be so extreme as to defy credibility (i.e. the belief has to be of ‘delusional proportions’), and (b) the patient must be unable to acknowledge the possibility that the belief may not be true (i.e. the belief has to be maintained with ‘delusional intensity’). However, in clinical practice, there may be problems in applying these criteria. For instance, the delusional intensity of a belief may fluctuate during a depressive episode: some clinicians and researchers will classify the belief as a delusion even if the delusional intensity is present only for most of the time during the depressive episode, whereas others will require that the delusional intensity be consistently present throughout the depressive episode. Moreover, it happens that a belief fulfills one of the two criteria above but not the other: it is of delusional proportions but not maintained with delusional intensity, or vice versa. In these cases, clinicians and researchers may reach different conclusions about whether or not the patient has a delusion. It is also useful to emphasize that, in the assessment of the presence of delusions in a depressed patient, both Received: June 22, 2007 Accepted after revision: July 30, 2007 Published online: October 18, 2007",

      "title": "COULD SELF‐NEGLECT IN OLDER ADULTS BE A GERIATRIC SYNDROME?",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: We refer to the interesting article by Drs. Pavlou and Lachs.1 The authors state that self-neglect in older adults could be a geriatric syndrome, and we agree that the aggregation of personal and environmental symptoms noted in such individuals is worthy of acceptance as a syndrome and as an entity in its own right. Nevertheless, one limitation is that no single model seems to satisfactorily explain the development of this syndrome. Psychotic disorders or severe cognitive impairment are the usual causes of extreme self-neglect and social withdrawal in subjects who have been socially efficient. But perhaps the most important point is that a large proportion of the cases (30–50%) appears to be suffering from no psychiatric disorder or from a disorder that is not sufficiently severe to explain their extreme social deterioration.2 These individuals are often described as having certain personality characteristics in common (stubbornness, aloofness, suspiciousness, and aggressiveness).3 We would like to mention several articles suggesting that self-neglect is an early behavioral demonstration of frontal lobe dysfunction (FLD).4 It is noteworthy that both conditions have symptoms in common, including social misconduct, lack of insight, and personality change (certain aspects of frontal lobe syndrome are surprisingly similar to many of the personality traits described in gross self-neglect).4,5 In a recent French study, dementia characterized by frontal dysfunction was found in four older adults experiencing self-neglect.5 The syndrome has also been described in several patients with nondemented FLD.6,7 Moreover, structural and functional frontal abnormalities have been noted in schizophrenia and major depression, which are the most frequent psychiatric diagnoses associated with self-neglecting behaviors.8 Self-neglect may therefore be a particular behavioral demonstration of FLD, which encourages a medico-social assumption. Further neuroimaging and neuropathological studies are required for a better understanding of the relationship between these conditions.

      "title": "Suicidology and Substance abuse in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for suicidal risk. Suicide currently ranks as the second or third leading cause of mortality among adolescents in developped countries. It has been shown that a history of suicidal act, of depressive disorder and of a substance use disorder (SUD), alcohol and drugs, are the most prominent risk factors for suicidal behaviour among adolescents. Data on alcohol and drug use disorders and suicide consisted primarily of reports on alcohol use disorders and, to a lesser extent, opioid use disorder. The magnitude of the association with other drugs is still unclear. The relationships between substance use disorder and suicidal behaviour are multiple: In the long term, SUD may be associated with increases in stress and co-occuring psychopathology (poor self esteem, feeling of worthlessness, isolation).These elements may reach a level where a suicide attempt is viewed as a means to cope with perceived unsolvable difficulties. During life crises, SUD can also be responsible for inhibiting adaptative coping and desinhibiting suicidal behaviour. Finally, SUD and suicidal behaviour share common vulnerability factors: history of childhood abuse, genetically determined dimensions such as impulsivity or psychiatric disorders, particularly unipolar depressive and bipolar disorder. Given the comorbidity between SUD and suicide, it is essential for treatment and prevention that all suicidal adolescents be screened for SUD and vice versa. Ideally, adolescents who receive diagnosis of SUD and co-occuring suicidality should follow an integrated treatment protocol that addresses both conditions.",

      "title": "P48: Underreporting of suicide in old age: accident or self-harm? Angela’s case",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Deaths from suicide often incur a misclassification. Suicide is in fact subject to stigma and shame; in some countries it is even criminalized. Furthermore, there are situations in which the intentionality of the suicidal behavior is really equivocal or there was a desire to disguise the death by suicide, for example for insurance reasons. In many cases, it can be difficult to ascertain if death was due to a deliberate act (such as not taking life-saving medication or overdosing on them; an accident or a voluntary fall, etc.). Suicide deaths involving older adults are particularly prone to under-reporting. The advanced age of the deceased may imply less investigative interest than a death in childhood or from medical complications. In addition, there are cases in which it is really difficult to classify the type of death. The following story may underline such a difficulty. Angela was 81 years old. A childless widow, sufficiently independent, was a guest in a nursing home for about a year; she was there - she said - mainly to fight her loneliness. However, in the nursing home she felt even lonelier than at home. Her house was sold shortly before entering her residence. She felt very frightened by the pandemic, which she followed for long hours on television: she had begun to say aloud that she didn't want to be intubated, and that there was no more oxygen for anyone anyway. Everybody would have died soon. She was given sedatives to calm her down, but in one occasion a nurse saw her holding the pills in her mouth and then spitting them down the toilet. Her roommate got sick and was taken away. Angela kept asking about her, receiving no answer. She was noticed having difficulties falling asleep and although she showed no signs of infection or disease, she was heard saying that her days were over. One day, she told the nurse that she had finally figured out what to do. A few days later, she was found dead during lunchtime, apparently suffocating on a piece of turkey.",

      "title": "Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency can occur as a severe neonatal-onset disease in males (but rarely in females) and as a post-neonatal-onset (partial deficiency) disease in males and females. Males with severe neonatal-onset OTC deficiency are typically normal at birth but become symptomatic from hyperammonemia on day two to three of life and are usually catastrophically ill by the time they come to medical attention. After successful treatment of neonatal hyperammonemic coma these infants can easily become hyperammonemic again despite appropriate treatment; they typically require liver transplant by age six months to improve quality of life. Males and heterozygous females with post-neonatal-onset (partial) OTC deficiency can present from infancy to later childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. No matter how mild the disease, a hyperammonemic crisis can be precipitated by stressors and become a life-threatening event at any age and in any situation in life. For all individuals with OTC deficiency, typical neuropsychological complications include developmental delay, learning disabilities, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and executive function deficits. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of OTC deficiency is established in a male proband with suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and/or at least ONE of the following: A hemizygous pathogenic variant in OTC by molecular genetic testing A markedly abnormal increase of orotic acid excretion after an allopurinol challenge test Decreased OTC enzyme activity in liver The diagnosis of OTC deficiency is usually established in a female proband with the suggestive clinical and laboratory findings and/or with at least ONE of the following: A heterozygous pathogenic variant in OTC by molecular genetic testing A markedly abnormal increase of orotic acid excretion after an allopurinol challenge test Measurement of OTC enzyme activity in liver is not a reliable means of diagnosis in females. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is best provided by a clinical geneticist and a nutritionist experienced in the treatment of metabolic disease; treatment of hyperammonemic coma should be provided by a team coordinated by a metabolic specialist in a tertiary care center experienced in the management of OTC deficiency. The mainstays of treatment of the acute phase are rapid lowering of the plasma ammonia level to ≤200 μmol/L (if necessary, with renal replacement therapy); use of ammonia scavenger treatment to allow excretion of excess nitrogen via alternative pathways; reversal of catabolism; and reducing the risk of neurologic damage. The goals of long-term treatment are to promote growth and development and to prevent hyperammonemic episodes. In severe, neonatal-onset urea cycle disorders, liver transplantation is typically performed by age six months to prevent further hyperammonemic crises and neurodevelopmental deterioration. In females and males with partial OTC deficiency liver transplant is typically considered in those who have frequent hyperammonemic episodes. Complications of OTC deficiency, including ADHD and learning disability/intellectual disability, are treated according to the standard of care for these conditions while monitoring for signs of liver disease. Prevention of primary manifestations: If neonatal-onset OTC deficiency is diagnosed prenatally, intravenous (IV) treatment with ammonia scavengers within a few hours of birth (before the ammonia level rises) can prevent a hyperammonemic crisis and coma. For preventive measures after the neonatal period see Treatment of manifestations. Prevention of secondary complications: Avoid overrestriction of protein/amino acids; use gastrostomy tube feedings as needed to help avoid malnutrition; practice careful hand hygiene among all who have contact with the affected individual to minimize risk of infection; give immunizations on the usual schedule, including annual flu vaccine; provide multivitamin and vitamin D supplementation; and use antipyretics appropriately (e.g., ibuprofen is preferred over acetaminophen because of the potential for liver toxicity). Surveillance: At the start of therapy, routine measurement of plasma ammonia and plasma amino acids. Assess liver function (depending on symptoms) every three to six months or more often when previously abnormal. Perform neuropsychological testing at the time of expected significant developmental milestones. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproate, haloperidol, systemic corticosteroids, fasting, and physical and psychological stress. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant in the family is known and if prenatal testing has not been performed, it is appropriate to perform biochemical and molecular genetic testing on at-risk newborns (males and females) as soon after birth as possible so that the appropriate treatment or surveillance (for those with the family-specific pathogenic variant) can be promptly established. If the pathogenic variant in the family is NOT known, biochemical analysis (plasma amino acid analysis, ammonia level), an allopurinol challenge test (in older individuals), and/or OTC enzyme activity measurement in liver (males only) can be performed. Preventive measures at birth should be instituted until such a time as the diagnosis can be ruled out. Pregnancy management: Heterozygous females are at risk of becoming catabolic during pregnancy and especially in the postpartum period. Those who are symptomatic need to be treated throughout pregnancy as necessary; those who are asymptomatic need to avoid catabolism in the peripartum and postpartum periods and should be treated as needed. Genetic counseling OTC deficiency is inherited in an X-linked manner. If an affected male reproduces, none of his sons will be affected and all of his daughters will inherit the pathogenic variant and may or may not develop clinical symptoms related to the disorder. Heterozygous females have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant with each pregnancy: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant may or may not develop clinical findings related to the disorder. Carrier testing for females at risk of being heterozygous and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the OTC pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member.",

      "title": "What Are Realistic Treatment Goals? Lingering Symptoms Require You to Evaluate Pharmacotherapy and Offer Psychosocial Interventions",
      "abstract": "The course of chronic psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, differs from chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes. Some patients with chronic psychiatric conditions achieve remission and become symptom-free, while others continue to have lingering signs of disease for life. Residual symptoms of schizophrenia are not fully defined in the literature, which poses a challenge because they are central in the overall treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. (1) During this phase of schizophrenia, patients continue to have symptoms after psychosis has subsided. These patients might continue to have negative symptoms such as social and emotional withdrawal and low energy. Although frank psychotic behavior has disappeared, the patient might continue to hold strange beliefs. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment option for psychiatric conditions, but the psychosocial aspect may have greater importance when treating residual symptoms and patients with chronic psychiatric illness. (2) A naturalistic study in Germany evaluated the occurrence and characteristics of residual symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. (3) The authors used a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale symptom severity score >1 for those purposes, which is possibly a stringent criterion to define residual symptoms. This multicenter study enrolled 399 individuals age 18 to 65 with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. (3) Of the 236 patients achieving remission at discharge, 94% had at least 1 residual symptom and 69% had at least 4 residual symptoms. Therefore, residual symptoms were highly prevalent in remitted patients. The most frequent residual symptoms were: * blunted affect * conceptual disorganization * passive or apathetic social withdrawal * emotional withdrawal * lack of judgment and insight * poor attention * somatic concern * difficulty with abstract thinking * anxiety * poor rapport. (3) Of note, positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinatory behavior, were found in remitted patients at discharge (17% and 10%, respectively). The study concluded that the severity of residual symptoms was associated with relapse risk and had an overall negative impact on the outcome of patients with schizophrenia. (3) The study noted that residual symptoms may be greater in number or volume than negative symptoms and questioned the origins of residual symptoms because most were present at baseline in more than two-third of patients. Patients with residual symptoms of schizophrenia usually are older and therefore present specific management challenges for clinicians. Changes associated with aging, such as medical problems, cognitive deficits, and lack of social support, could create new care needs for this patient population. Although the biopsychosocial model used to treat chronic psychiatric conditions, especially schizophrenia, is preferred, older schizophrenia patients with residual symptoms often need more psychosocial interventions compared with young adults with schizophrenia. Managing residual symptoms in schizophrenia Few studies are devoted to pharmacological treatment of older adults with schizophrenia, likely because pharmacotherapy for older patients with schizophrenia can be challenging. Evidence-based treatment is based primarily on findings from younger patients who survived into later life. Clinicians often use the adage of geriatric psychiatry, start low, go slow, because older patients are susceptible to adverse effects associated with psychiatric medications, including cardiovascular, metabolic, anticholinergic, and extrapyramidal effects, orthostasis, sedation, falls, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Older patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and anticholinergic adverse effects, perhaps because of degeneration of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. …",

      "abstract": "Several points emerge from the large body of data on the effects of alcohol on CNS function. First, the degree of impairment is dose related, but not identical or strictly linear for all behaviors. Alcohol-related impairment of behavioral skills involved in driving is greatest for those tasks that require cognitive functioning; simple perception alone is least affected. Impairment of cognitive functioning, which includes information processing and decision making under conditions of divided attention, is evident at BALs above 50 mg/dl and is markedly affected above 100 mg/dl. Above a BAL of 100 mg/dl, almost all behavioral skills are impaired by alcohol. Most studies have employed only one or at most two doses of alcohol in testing for impairment. The limited range of BALs studied makes determination of the overall shape of the dose-response curve difficult. Second, alcohol-related impairment of CNS functions cannot be demonstrated at low BALs. There is no consistent evidence that BALs below 50 mg/dl impair any behavior in most individuals. Youth and the elderly, groups not typically studied in the laboratory, may represent exceptions to this general observation. Nonetheless, these findings are more consistent with a threshold effect for impairment than for impairment at all levels of BAL. Third, for most behavioral skills, the decrement in performance after alcohol is slight, rarely exceeding 35-50% of the control period. In many studies, changes of only 8-10% are reported to be statistically significant. Whether these small statistically significant decrements in performance are an explanation for increased crash risk remains uncertain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The childhood antecedents of psychiatric disorder in adult life are reviewed with regard to four groups of conditions that show sharply contrasting patterns of linkage between childhood and adult life. For emotional disorders the links are weak and the mechanisms largely unknown. About half of schizophrenic psychoses are preceded by non-psychotic abnormalities of behaviour in childhood; the processes involved are probably largely constitutional. Affective disorders only infrequently begin in childhood and the behavioural percursors of adult depression do not constitute a clearly recognisable pattern. However, adverse experiences in childhood may create a vulnerability to later depression. The child-adult linkages are strongest with conduct disturbance in childhood and adult personality disorder, the mechanisms in this continuity are probably both constitutional and environmental.",

      "abstract": "Pain relief is a significant determinant of quality of life for cancer survivors. However, effective pain management is often complicated by the multiple determinants of the chronic pain experience. For a minority of survivors, nociceptive or neuropathic pain may develop or persist following a pain-free interval of variable duration despite apparent recovery of damaged tissue and continued disease-free status. Additionally, survivors may also suffer from other chronic pain conditions that may have been acquired before or after the cancer diagnosis and treatment. The experience of chronic pain often has deleterious effects on sexual functioning, related either to the noxious stimulus of pain or as a negative consequence of pain management. Common pharmacological approaches and interventional techniques utilized in the treatment of pain have documented effects on sexual functioning. Current treatment strategies offer varying degrees of symptom resolution. Future research is needed to examine the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of chronic pain and medications for pain management on sexual function. Further research is also needed to address the efficacy of treatment options, including combining medical interventions with sexual counseling in the treatment of sexual disorders.",

Psychogenic movement disorder falls under the category of functional neurological disorders, which are diagnosed based on the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Patient concerns: A 25-year-old Saudi male with a history of recurrent superior ventricular tachycardia presented to the emergency department with tremors affecting all his extremities for 8 days. Tremors were nonrhythmic, continuous, and worsened over time and were exacerbated by reaching objects. There was no history of similar presentations or neurological diseases. Diagnoses: Examination revealed high-frequency, high-amplitude tremors and rigidity in all extremities, and hyperreflexia in the lower limbs. Laboratory findings were unremarkable; thus, the psychiatric team was consulted for possible PTs. Interventions: Psychiatric assessments showed no evidence of psychiatric disorders. The patient only received psychoeducation about his diagnosis. Outcomes: The tremor was completely resolved by the time of discharge. Lessons: In our case, the patient’s PT resolved entirely with education alone, differing from previous cases that included psychotherapy and medication, emphasizing the importance of the doctor–patient relationship and the need for future research on effective approaches to delivering diagnosis to patients.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the leading causes of suffering in the elderly, but it is often under-diagnosed and under-treated. Depression in late life represents a heterogeneous group of mood disturbances that may present with variable features. Current issues in depression in late life are discussed. The prevalence of ”clinically significant depressive symptoms” among community-dwelling older adults ranges from approximately 8% to 16%. The prevalence estimates of ”major depression” in community samples of elderly people have been quite low, ranging from 1% to 4%. There is increasing evidence that structural change, especially vascular in nature, renders some people in later life vulnerable to depression. Data regarding longitudinal outcomes and biological, psychosocial, and functional correlates increasingly support the notion that minor and subsyndromal depressions are part of a spectrum of depressive illness severity. Disorders of the basal ganglia and their prefrontal projections are often complicated by depression and result in executive dysfunction. These depressed patients with executive dysfunction appear at a higher risk of developing dementia later In later life, the most common diagnosis in those who attempt or complete suicide is major depression. Comorbidity with an anxiety disorder is associated with a more severe depression, a higher level of suicidality and poorer treatment outcomes. Increased medical comorbidity is characteristic in late-life depression. In spite of similar treatment responses, elderly patients spend longer time to remission, and have higher rate of relapse than do younger patients. By raising awareness and understanding of depression among primary healthcare, more depressed elderly with comorbid medical problems can be successfully identified and helped.",

We present three cases with an incorrectly diagnosed Bell's palsy or inadequate diagnostics or treatment: a 5-year-old male with recurrent facial palsy caused by acute otitis media; a 46-year-old male with facial palsy caused by a malignant parotid tumour; and a 75-year-old female with facial palsy caused by a facial nerve schwannoma in the mastoid segment of the facial nerve.

In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children.

About one in seven patients will not get better even at 1‐2 years after the eliciting trauma, and for this group establishing the causation can be an important issue within a medico-legal context. Known CRPS risk factors such as female sex explain only a small fraction of the variability in developing the condition after trauma, whereas recent research has soundly rejected the idea of a predisposing CRPS personality. Although it is unknown what causes CRPS, there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that any trauma at any time would have anyway caused the condition. In the absence of firm evidence on causation it appears most logical to consider the particular trauma sustained at the particular time point as the most crucial element to the CRPS causation.",

It is an inflammatory disorder consecutive to the formation of venule-centered areas, or plaques, scattered haphazardly. These plaques contain reactive cells and harbor myelin and axonal damage. Whether remyelination is a constant feature is at issue, but, if it is present, it is clearly ineffective at restoring myelin and axonal integrity. The consensus is that MS is an atypical autoimmune disorder (Reder and Antel, 1983). A genetic contribution to the etiology has been deduced from family studies (Sadovnick et al., 1997, 1998). MS is twice as common in women than it is in men, and affects predominantly Caucasians (Whitacre et al., 1999). The most classical clinical manifestation of MS is a relapse, which is an acute or subacute episode of neurological dysfunction lasting several weeks, followed by a remission. Relapses are unpredictable in time course, severity, duration, and site of lesion. MS course is usually protracted, only five or six years of overall longevity being lost (Sadovnick et al., 1992). Although still incurable, therapeutic breakthroughs have been attained that partially decrease the formation of new plaques (Paty and Hartung, 1999).",

      "abstract": "Post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) is a constellation of serious adverse side effects manifested in clinical symptoms that develop and persist in patients during and/or after discontinuing finasteride treatment in men with pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) or benign prostatic hyperplasia. These serious adverse side effects include persistent or irreversible sexual, neurological, physical and mental side effects. To date, there are no evidence-based effective treatments for PFS. Although increasing number of men report persistent side effects, the medical community has yet to recognize this syndrome nor are there any specific measures to address this serious and debilitating symptoms. Here we evaluate the scientific and clinical evidence in the contemporary medical literature to address the very fundamental question: Is PFS a real clinical condition caused by finasteride use or are the reported symptoms only incidentally associated with but not caused by finasteride use? One key indisputable clinical evidence noted in all reported studies with finasteride and dutasteride was that use of these drugs is associated with development of sexual dysfunction, which may persist in a subset of men, irrespective of age, drug dose or duration of study. Also, increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation in a subset of men treated with these drugs were commonly reported in a number of studies. It is important to note that many clinical studies suffer from incomplete or inadequate assessment of adverse events and often limited or inaccurate data reporting regarding harm. Based on the existing body of evidence in the contemporary clinical literature, the author believes that finasteride and dutasteride induce a constellation of persistent sexual, neurological and physical adverse side effects, in a subset of men. These constellations of symptoms constitute the basis for PFS in individuals predisposed to epigenetic susceptibility. Indeed, delineating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PFS will be of paramount importance to the understanding of this syndrome and to development of potential novel therapeutic modalities.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Ceux qui s'étaient entaillés le poignet étaient plus jeunes et leurs actes étaient d'une létalité plus faible. Ils sont peu susceptibles d'avoir déjà posé des gestes suicidaires. Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation. La réaction typique est la suivante: une fois la blessure infligée, et après une période de dépersonnalisation suivit de détente et de repersonnalisation provoquée par le saignement, le patient n'éprouve aucune douleur.",

      "title": "The lifelong course of social anxiety disorder: a clinical perspective",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is among the most frequently observed psychiatric disorders, with estimates of approximately 10% of people likely to suffer from the disorder during their lifetime. However, despite causing significant impairment of normal functioning, this disorder is often mistaken as shyness and remains under‐recognized and under‐treated. Following onset in adolescence, patients with generalized SAD often experience a lifelong and unremitting mental disorder characterized by severe anxiety and disability. Typical duration of the illness is far in excess of that seen in panic disorder, and prospective, long‐term, naturalistic studies have indicated that only one‐third of individuals attain remission from SAD within 8 years, compared with over two‐thirds of those with panic disorder. Comorbidity of other anxiety disorders, depression and personality disorders are common in SAD and associated with more pronounced impairment and a poorer long‐term outcome. Effective treatment for SAD is available but use is low and may remain suboptimal, despite the development of pharmacotherapeutic agents with anxiolytic and antidepressant properties and the efficacy of psychotherapeutic approaches. Increased knowledge of the course of SAD highlights the need to examine the role of available treatments, administered individually or in combination, as acute, continuation or maintenance therapy to maximize the chances of remission and long‐term benefit for patients.",

      "abstract": "Psychische Schaeden als Unfallfolgen fuehren oft zum Rechtsstreit. Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis. Unerlaesslich ist eine Pruefung der zeitlichen Abfolge (Folge nach der Ursache), also ob aehnliche Befunde bereits vor dem Unfall bestanden haben. Bei den Stoerungsbildern dissoziative Bewegungsstoerungen und somative Stoerungen koennen durch den Untersucher keine krankhaften Befunde, bei der traumatischen Belastungsstoerung nur spaerliche Befunde erhoben werden.

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

      "abstract": "As many as 21 million people in the U.S. suffer with taste and smell dysfunction. These symptoms occur after a viral‐type illness (~300,000 yearly), after brain injuries (~600,000 yearly), associated with allergic rhinitis (~200,000 yearly), following x‐irradiation to the head and neck (~50,000 yearly), after chemotherapy (~30,000 yearly) and with neurodegenerative disorders (&gt;500,000 patients). These symptoms alter quality of daily life including appetite alteration with subsequent malnutrition, accidental exposure to gas or spoiled food, social isolation and depression due to persistence of these symptoms. When patients access their physicians for medical assistance they are told there is little known about these problems, there is no known treatment and they should learn to live with these symptoms. This leaves patients with a double problem – presence of these symptoms and inability to obtain help or hope for their evaluation or treatment. This tragedy has been averted in many patients based upon biochemical and clinical studies in which these symptoms were evaluated, their etiologies defined (related to biochemical changes in several body functions) and, based upon these evaluations, effective treatment initiated to correct these dysfunctions. This information must be promulgated to both patients and physicians so this tragedy can end and patients can receive effective evaluation and treatment.",

Three sex drive reducing therapies are in use, all designed for male patients, (1) pharmacological reduction of circulating testosterone, (2) orchidectomy, (3) deletion of certain brain structures by stereotaxic surgery. The main indication for pharmacological sex drive reduction is exhibitionism but here it should be used only temporarily, as a first emergency measure, and after that only intermittently, during periods when the patient can not manage his urges by techniques he should be taught by a behaviour therapist. In cases of unmanageable and dangerous sadism, orchidectomy is the method of choice--and the same would appear to be true for particular cases of pedohebephilia. Brain surgery in this realm is not yet based on sufficient knowledge and should be thoroughly studied on infrahuman primates, before use with humans could be seriously considered.",

      "abstract": "Abstract While sexual dysfunction is a well-known side effect of taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), in an undetermined number of patients, sexual function does not return to pre-drug baseline after stopping SSRIs. The condition is known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) and is characterised most commonly by genital numbness, pleasureless or weak orgasm, loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. This article provides a commentary on the incidence and prevalence of PSSD based on a combination of academic literature as well as clinical and research experience. A number of obstacles to quantifying the occurrence of PSSD are outlined including difficulty in designing a suitable study method. Other contextual obstacles include patient embarrassment at raising sexual concerns, the response of healthcare professionals, inability to stop an antidepressant due to withdrawal issues in a proportion of patients and patient unawareness that their sexual difficulties are linked to prior medication compounded by variability of online information and a lack of information aimed at public education. A definition of PSSD with diagnostic criteria has been published. A MedDRA code for PSSD has also been introduced, but this is yet to be adopted by regulators.",

Although 30-60% of CADASIL patients have migraine, acute confusional state during migraine has not been described. We describe 7 patients with ACM that complicated up to 50% of the migraine episodes.Detailed neurologic evaluation was performed in 20 CADASIL patients; International Classification of Headache Disorders 2nd edition criteria were used to diagnose migraine.The mean age was 51 years. Fourteen patients reported headache and 11 met the criteria for migraine (mean age of onset 25). Seven patients experienced concomitant confusion, within 3 years of migraine onset. Confusion occurred either abruptly or insidiously, at the onset of aura or headache, lasting for 2-48 hours, and ending abruptly. These episodes were stereotypic, characterized by disorientation with agitation, and retrograde amnesia for the episodes. Patients reported disorientation to time and place, inability to recognize friends and relatives, difficulty with finding directions home, fear of getting lost, inability to analyze traffic lights or tell time. Patients reliably predicted the episodes and felt the need to seek a safe place for protection. Severity of the episodes progressed, but a striking improvement occurred after the first stroke.ACM may be a presenting feature and important clue, enabling CADASIL to be recognized up to a decade or earlier than at present. Therefore, a brain MRI and/or testing for Notch3 mutations should be considered in adult patients with ACM.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "title": "The Effect of Drugs on Male Sexual Function and Fertility",
      "abstract": "Drugs may have negative effects on male libido, erection, ejaculation and orgasm, as well as on fertility, and research on these effects is increasing. Libido may be decreased by drugs that block dopamine or testosterone, or that cause dysphoria. Erection may be decreased by drugs that divert blood flow from the penis, or drugs that affect spinal reflexes. Ganglion blockers may also inhibit erection. Ejaculation may be diminished by drugs that affect spinal reflexes or be inhibited by ganglion blockage. Enervation of the vas deferens and epididymis may be blocked and cause a smaller emission. Retrograde ejaculation may occur due to blockage of the internal urethral sphincter. Orgasm is usually inhibited by the drugs that inhibit ejaculation. Fertility is impaired by drugs that affect sexual performance or spermatogenesis. Major groups of drugs that may affect male sexual function include drugs of abuse, CNS depressants, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, psychotherapeutics, hormones, and cancer therapeutics, in addition to miscellaneous other agents. Information about these drugs has been arranged in tables so that the provider has a convenient reference to use when explaining to men the effect of drugs on sexual response and fertility.",

      "title": "Abuso sexual infantil: desafío multidisciplinar. Un abordaje integral del problema para mejorar su detección y la atención a la víctima",
      "abstract": "espanolEl abuso sexual infantil (ASI) es el delito de malos tratos a menores que mas sumergida y silenciosamente ocurre ante la sociedad, por lo que en un alto porcentaje queda impune. Las secuelas que origina en la psicologia de la victima son profundas y prolongadas, y a menudo resultan devastadoras para su biografia posterior, hecho que solo puede ser evitado si el abuso es detectado y se brinda al menor una adecuada rehabilitacion psicoemocional. La mejora en su deteccion y abordaje profesional es una responsabilidad que recae, entre otros servidores publicos, sobre el pediatra. Pero el analisis objetivo de este problema pone de manifiesto que las formas mas comunes de presentacion clinica del ASI ante el pediatra son las cripticas, sobre todo en forma de trastornos comportamentales o de somatizaciones neuroticas de la victima, a priori inespecificas, por efecto del desbordamiento emocional debido al padecimiento silencioso y a la vivencia solitaria de desamparo, en la mayoria de los casos, sin mediar revelacion alguna por parte de aquella ni hallar pruebas fisicas en su exploracion. Ante este hecho, y partiendo solo de una mera sospecha o posibilidad intuida, el pediatra se enfrenta a un autentico desafio en su deber de deteccion, asistencia, notificacion y custodia a la victima. El presente trabajo tiene por objetivo ayudar al pediatra a orientar correctamente su actuacion al afrontar este desafio. Se expone para ello el resultado de un analisis integral del problema, en el que han sido abordados no solo aspectos de la presentacion clinica y la actuacion medica a recomendar, sino tambien de la fenomenologia social y familiar del ASI y del devenir judicial y biografico de los casos, con el fin de orientar mejor la actuacion pediatrica. Esta, que debe tener como objetivo prioritario la proteccion y rehabilitacion emocional del menor, pero intentando minimizar al maximo las posibles repercusiones psicosociales en la victima y su familia, no halla su unica solucion en el aumento de formacion y concienciacion pediatricas, sino que exige la habilitacion de recursos especializados y multidisciplinares, agiles, discretos y capaces de asumir un seguimiento coordinado a largo plazo, lamentablemente aun no disponibles en muchas comunidades de nuestro pais. Este tipo de seguimiento multidisciplinar y coordinado, necesario tambien para otras formas de sospecha de maltrato y patologias de indole psicosocial, es justificacion suficiente para reivindicar la creacion de Unidades de Pediatria Psicosocial. EnglishChild Sexual Abuse (CSA) is the crime of child abuse that occurs so stealthily and is so submerged in society that it often goes unpunished. The psychological sequels for the victim are both deep and prolonged and can lead to devastating effects on the child's future which can only be prevented if the abuse is detected and appropriate psychoemotional rehabilitation rovided. The improvement of its detection and victim treatment is a professional sponsibility that lies on the pediatrician, along with other public servants. However, an objective analysis of this issue makes it evident that most common forms of clinical presentation of CSA to the paediatrician are cryptic and usually present themselves as behavioral disorders or neurotic somatization of the victim, a priori unspecified, as consequence of the emotional overflow caused by suffering in silence and solitary experience of helplessness, in the majority of cases, without any disclosure on the victim's part or the finding of any physical evidence after our exploration. Given this fact, the pediatrician is faced with the challenging task of detecting, assisting, reporting and taking care of the victim on the basis of mere suspicion or intuition. The present work aims to help the pediatrician to correctly guide their actions to meet this challenge. A comprehensive analysis of the problem is carried out, addressing not only aspects of the clinical and medical action to recommend, but also the social and family phenomenology of CSA and the legal and biographical becoming of cases, in order to target the pediatric performance. This, it must have as a priority the child's emotional protection and rehabilitation, but trying to minimize the maximum the possible sychosocial impact on the victim and his family. To achieve this it's not the only solution in increasing pediatric training and awareness, but requires the empowerment of specialized resources for a multidisciplinary assessment which has to be prompt, discreet and capable of providing long-term follow up, not yet available in many communities in our country. The need for this multidisciplinary and coordinated monitoring, which is also required in other types of abuse and psycho-social pathologies, is reason enough to vindicate the creation of Pediatric Psycho-Social Units.",

      "abstract": "The importance of depression as a psychopathologic syndrome in the elderly is stressed by the estimate that about 30 percent of persons over the age of 65 may be expected to experience an episode of depression severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. Depression is the chief cause of psychiatric hospitalization among the elderly, and it bears great potential for death through inanition or suicide. Loss of mastery (ability to cope) and the onset of helplessness are frequent dynamic issues in the development of depression or behavioral problems in the elderly. Geriatric stereotypes contribute directly to helplessness by reinforcing such behavior. Stereotypes also minimize the chance of appropriate response outcomes relative to needs. Rolelessness, a partial result of stereotyping, leads to anomie, alienation, and lowered self-esteem. These issues are discussed and points of interaction among them are examined. The relevance to psychotherapy with older persons is outlined.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Insomnia and psychiatric disorders frequently occur together. Epidemiological studies have revealed that individuals with insomnia are more likely to have clinically significant psychological symptoms in comparison with individuals without insomnia. For example, a recent population survey indicated that adults with insomnia were up to nine times more likely to have clinically significant depressive symptoms and were up to 17 times more likely to have clinically significant anxiety symptoms than those without insomnia. Epidemiological studies also have demonstrated that approximately 25% to 50% of individuals with clinically significant insomnia meet criteria for insomnia that is comorbid with a psychiatric disorder, including mood and anxiety disorders and have an increased lifetime prevalence of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Furthermore, in samples of patients from sleep clinics, this rate was even higher — more than 75% of patients with insomnia also met criteria for a psychiatric disorder. In general, sleep disruption is one of the most common and consistent symptoms of psychiatric disorders, and is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision, (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria for depression, mania and hypomania, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael J.

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to evaluation and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) involves taking an accurate history, prospective daily symptom monitoring to establish the diagnosis, patient-specific initial medical or psychological therapy, and adequate follow-up with appropriate alterations in the treatment plan. A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

      "title": "Vagotonia and Cardiac Arrest during Spinal Anesthesia ",
      "abstract": "SUDDEN cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia can occur in otherwise healthy patients. 1–6Although respiratory depression secondary to excessive sedation is responsible in some cases, sudden cardiac arrest can occur without overt signs of respiratory depression in hemodynamically stable patients. 1Vasovagal reactions have been reported to cause cardiac arrest during spinal and epidural anesthesia. 5,6Increased vagal tone, or vagotonia, is present in approximately 7% of the population. 7Such individuals frequently have a history of recurrent reactions precipitated by emotional or physical stress. Vagotonic manifestations can include nausea, sweating, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. 7,8If a patient who is prone to have vasovagal reactions is exposed to emotional stress during spinal anesthesia, what might otherwise be a benign or transient reaction may progress to cardiac arrest. 5,6Two incidents of syncope and asystole, during two separate spinal anesthetics, are described in a patient with a history of recurrent vasovagal reactions.A 37-yr-old, 170-cm, 67-kg, 14-weeks-pregnant patient was scheduled to undergo cerclage for cervical incompetence. Medications included prenatal vitamins, and no allergies were reported. An electrocardiogram was not available. The remainder of the history and physical examination were unremarkable, except for a history of \"passing out\" if exposed to needles. Three years earlier, the patient fainted during a spinal anesthetic for a similar procedure. Medical records from the first cerclage were received only after discharge from this admission. Then, the patient was 12 weeks pregnant and scheduled for her first cervical cerlage. She was given 50 mg of 5% lidocaine without epinephrine in the sitting position. Soon thereafter, she fainted, but she recovered spontaneously after 30–60 s. Blood pressure (130/80 mmHg) and heart rate (85 beats/min) were reported as stable during the syncopal episode. The anesthesiologist did not record or recall the sensory level achieved by the spinal anesthetic, except that the level was not high and sensory and motor function of the upper extremities was intact. No sedation was administered. Despite the patient's fear of needles, she consented to a spinal anesthetic for the second procedure.Upon arrival in the operating room, standard monitors were applied, including a pulse oximeter and a nasal cannula with an end-tidal carbon dioxide sampling port. Midazolam, 2 mg intravenously, was given to reduce her anxiety during placement of the spinal anesthetic. Before the intrathecal injection, 1,500 ml of Ringer's lactated solution was administered intravenously. An intrathecal injection of 80 mg of 5% lidocaine in dextrose was performed using a 25-gauge needle, with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Immediately after the injection of the anesthetic, the patient was moved to the supine position. The operating table was tilted so that the patient's head was elevated slightly. Blood pressure and heart rate decreased slightly from 120/70 to 105/65 mmHg and 80 to 70 beats/min, respectively, after injection of the anesthetic. A stable T4 level was achieved 10 min after the lidocaine injection. The patient was awake and breathing comfortably. Twenty minutes after administration of the spinal anesthetic, the patient complained of left hand and arm pain as an antibiotic was given intravenously. Immediately after verbalizing these complaints, bradycardia was noted, which progressed to asystole with loss of consciousness and no palpable blood pressure. The patient was given 100% oxygen by mask, chest compressions were begun, and 1 mg of atropine was administered intravenously. Approximately 30 s later, a sinus rhythm and palpable pulse were noted, and chest compressions were discontinued. Blood pressure and heart rate were 115/70 mmHg and 90 beats/min, respectively; the patient was awake, alert, and breathing without difficulty. Hand strength was not diminished, and the sensory level remained at T4. The patient stated, \"I guess that I passed out again.\"The balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity is not equal in approximately 7% of the population who have increased vagal tone, or vagotonia. 7Although vagotonia can occur at any age, it frequently is observed in young, athletic individuals and typically is precipitated by an emotionally or physically stressful event. Pallor, weakness, sweating, nausea, and retching frequently precede unconsciousness. Physiologic studies have demonstrated that vagal stimulation decreases heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. 8Electrophysiologic studies have demonstrated that conduction across the atrioventricular node is prolonged or dissociated, and resting electrocardiograms frequently reveal first- or second-degree atrioventricular block. 7Significant bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope for up to 20 min can occur, even in the absence of anesthesia. Patients with severe or frequent syncope may be treated long-term with atropine, a sympathomimetic agent, or a permanent pacemaker. 7In most other cases, symptoms usually are transient and resolve spontaneously, as the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity is restored.The primary physiologic mechanism responsible for the syncope and cardiac arrest in this patient could be (1) uniquely related to the underlying vagotonia, (2) caused by a combination of the underlying vagotonia and the autonomic disturbances caused by the spinal anesthesia, (3) caused solely by the autonomic perturbations of the spinal anesthesia, or (4) related to either the underlying vagotonia or the autonomic disturbances but unable to make a distinction.We believe that the syncopal incident during the first cerclage was uniquely related to the underlying vagotonia. Our patient was young and athletic and had a history of \"passing out\" if exposed to needles. Considering her underlying vagotonia it is not surprising that a reaction occurred in a hospital setting with ample exposure to needles and other stressful circumstances. The sensation of the spinal needle as it entered or exited the skin, or exposure to a sensory-level testing needle, was probably the precipitating event.The cardiac arrest during the second cerclage resulted from a combination of the underlying vagotonia and the autonomic changes accompanying the spinal anesthesia. If the sympathetic system is blocked by a spinal anesthetic, and a vasovagal reaction occurs, then the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems may be disturbed even further. The additional vagal stimulation may lead to bradycardia and cardiac arrest. 3,5,6Blood pressure and heart rate were stable for over 20 min before asystole suddenly occurred after a painful intravenous injection. This stress event produced additional vagal stimulation, which in the presence of a sympathetic blockade led to cardiac arrest. In the absence of either contributing factor, the autonomic disturbances of the spinal anesthesia or the vagotonia, symptoms may been mild or unappreciated.The autonomic changes that accompany spinal anesthesia can cause significant bradycardia and hypotension and could have been the sole cause of either the syncope or cardiac arrest. However, the syncope during the first episode occurred almost immediately after the intrathecal injection, before the local anesthetic had time to have an effect, and blood pressure and pulse were stable, and motor and sensory function in the upper extremity were intact before and after the cardiac arrest. For these reasons, it seems unlikely that the described events were solely related to the spinal anesthesia.Although reported, 1respiratory depression is an unlikely explanation for either described incident. The patient received no sedation during the first anesthetic and received only 2 mg intravenous midazolam before cardiac arrest and was responsive, without change in pulse oximetry or end-tidal carbon dioxide readings.Treatment of sinus arrest during spinal anesthesia depends upon the mechanisms responsible. Because most vagally mediated syncopal episodes resolve rapidly and spontaneously, treatment may be unnecessary. However, if the hypotension, bradycardia, or sinus arrest do not resolve quickly, then a vagolytic agent, such as atropine, or a sympathomimetic agent may be appropriate. Because the bradycardia and sinus arrest were felt to be vagally mediated during the second cerclage, atropine was administered intravenously and proved to be effective. If no response was observed with atropine, epinephrine would have been the next best choice. Administering a potent sympathomimetic agent as the first line of treatment, particularly if there is any doubt as to the cause of the cardiac arrest, has its advantages. Alpha-adrenergic stimulation raises systemic vascular resistance essential for coronary and cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and β-stimulation opposes the negative chronotropic and the inotropic effects of vagal stimulation.Prompt treatment is important. In a closed-claim study, Caplan et al. 1attributed significant neurologic injury or death to delayed treatment of cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia. Prophylactic treatment also may be warranted. A history of syncope after exercise or noxious stimuli and first- or second-degree atrioventricular block indicate a state of vagotonia. Prophylactic administration of atropine should be considered, and an external pacemaker readily available.Otherwise healthy patients can experience sudden cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia. Vasovagal reactions can occur during spinal anesthesia, may exacerbate the adverse hemodynamic consequences of spinal anesthesia, and led to bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest. Our report suggests that a history of vasovagal reactions may indicate an increased risk of cardiac arrest during spinal anesthesia. In such patients, the clinician should consider administration of prophylactic atropine and be prepared to provide prompt and appropriate resuscitative measures.",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "abstract": "Comorbidity of schizophrenia and transsexualism is still controversial. Some authors exclude diagnosis of transsexualism in patients with psychosis others report this coexistence as very rare. Delusions of sex change have been described by some authors in about 20-25% of schizophrenic patients. Patient's \"pseudotranssexual\" beliefs are usually bizarre and do not cause diagnostic doubts. In some cases complaints of gender dysphoria are predominant and psychotic symptoms can be underestimated or even unnoticed before sex reassignment procedure. Presentation of various clinical manifestation of gender dysphoria in patients with schizophrenia. Three clinical cases are described. Two patients have developed \"pseudotranssexual\" beliefs during course of psychosis. The first of them is an example of gender identity disorders related to psychotic process. The second patient presented complex psychopathology of schizophrenia and somatic symptoms which can hinder the diagnosis. The third patient has been diagnosed as a transsexual woman after diagnosis of severe schizophrenia and has undergone sex reassignment. Next she was hospitalized several times because relapses of psychosis but also because of alcohol withdrawal. Currently this patient has symptoms of dementia and a few severe somatic diagnoses. The experiences of practitioners indicate that coincidence of schizophrenia and gender identity disorder is possible. Nevertheless, the consequence of misdiagnosis and sex reassignment can be serious and unconvertible. That is why the diagnosis of transsexualism in patients with psychosis should not be made hastily. It needs time, careful observation, examination and cooperation of psychiatrist and sexologist.",

However, no evidence exists that psychological symptoms are directly related to hormonal changes during the climacteric. Psychological and social factors not specifically related to the climacteric appear to be an important predictor of psychological complaints during this period. Menopause has for long been regarded as a deficiency disease, requiring medical attention and hormone replacement therapy. However, it may be concluded that oestrogen is only a specific treatment for hot flushes and dyspareunia, but has no clear role in the management of psychological symptoms in menopausal women. A multifactorial approach, paying attention simultaneously to biological, psychological and social factors supposed to influence complaints during the climacteric may be more appropriate. A description of an integration of medical and cognitive‐behavioural treatment procedures in case of climacteric symptoms is given.",

Estos pacientes suelen recibir un diagnóstico clínico de “trastorno de la personalidad”, pero probablemente sea más apropiado describirlos como pacientes “multiproblemáticos” debido a los déficits ampliamente extendidos en su funcionamiento cognitivo, emocional, conductual y social. Estos pacientes suelen experimentar estados emocionales negativos crónicos, como depresión, ansiedad, apatía, aburrimiento, soledad, culpa e ira. Este afectividad alterada es el principal impulsor de una plétora de respuestas de afrontamiento desadaptativas: las principales son la conducta suicida repetitiva y las conductas adictivas como el abuso de alcohol/drogas, los trastornos alimentarios y/o la automutilación crónica. Los pacientes multiproblemáticos también experimentan importantes déficits en el funcionamiento social e interpersonal. Tienen problemas para formar y mantener relaciones interpersonales y a menudo introducen en el proceso terapéutico un conjunto de cuestiones conflictivas en torno a la formación y el mantenimiento de relaciones adultas, tanto superficiales como íntimas.

      "title": "Ruminative Coping with Depression",
      "abstract": "Most people have periods in which they become at least moderately depressed: they feel sad, they lose their motivation and interest in their usual activities, they slow down and are chronically fatigued, and so on. For most people, these periods last only a few days and their symptoms never become debilitating. For others, these periods last weeks or months, and their symptoms become worse with time. I suggest that the ways people initially try to regulate or cope with their symptoms of depression can affect the severity and duration of these symptoms. Specifically, people who have a ruminative style of responding to their initial symptoms of depression will have longer and more severe episodes of depressed mood than people who have more active, less ruminative response styles. A ruminative response style for depression is defined as the tendency to focus passively and repetitively on one's symptoms of depression and on the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms without taking action to relieve them. Ruminative responses to depression exacerbate and prolong periods of depression through at least three mechanisms. First, rumination enhances the negative effects of depressed mood on thinking, making depressive interpretations of events and negative memories more accessible and more likely to be used in ongoing deliberations about one's life. Second, rumination interferes with complex interpersonal problem-solving, in part because it enhances pessimistic, distorted thinking. Third, rumination inhibits people from engaging in everyday instrumental behaviors that could enhance their sense of control and lift their moods.",

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

Both major clinical elements, the productive symptoms and the signs of deficit, seem in part to be reactive to the degree of stimulation in the psychosocial environment, though such factors by no means explain all their variability. The negative impairment tends to antedate florid onset and is a better predictor of social outcome than the florid symptoms. There is, however, no firm evidence that deterioration (deficit inevitably increasing with time) occurs. Manfred Bleuler's formulation summarises the overall outcome of a substantial part of what most clinicians who do not include a chronic course as part of the diagnosis call schizophrenia. About 20–25% recover, about 20–25% remain severely impaired throughout, the remainder run a fluctuating course.",

ClassificationLow back pain can be acute, sub-acute or long-term; acute-on-chronic, with recurrence rearing its head among a significant minority.Acute low back pain is usually defined as the duration of an episode of low back pain persisting for less than 6 weeks; sub-acute as LBP which lasts between 6 and 12 weeks and long-term LBP as persisting for 12 weeks or more; chronic LBP is defined as LBP persisting for 12 weeks or more.Recurrent low back pain is defined as a new episode after a symptom-free period of 6 months, but not an exacerbation of chronic low back pain (van Tulder et al, 2004).Walker, 2000 estimated that 70-95% of any adult population will suffer at least one episode of back pain in its lifetime, while Truchon, 2001 proposed 60-80%.Fifty per cent of such cases will recur within 3 months (Lawrence et al, 2006).Recurrent and chronic LBP accounts for more than 70% of cases reported at clinics.Acute LBP is a common presentation of back pain and it is usually self-limiting; lasting less than 3 months and may not need any medical intervention.About half of those individuals who experience acute LBP will have recurrences within the first year of the first episode, leading to a possible history of chronic low back pain (Moffroid, 1997).Waddell and Bry-Jones (1994) submitted that LBP not settled within 8-12 weeks is likely to result in chronic disabling pain.Acute LBP tends towards becoming a complex chronic pain disorder, involving anatomical, physiological, psychological and social aspects (Roach et al, 1997).Chronic/recurrent LBP is a chief source of incapacitation, suffering and expense frequently resulting in significant worry and interference with daily activities leading to significant level of disability.It is a tremendous burden on patients and health service providers.It usually results from acute pain of muscular or connective tissue origin, which persists in approximately 30% of cases in adults and 20% of cases in adolescents.

Directions in their life are absent or their set is very limited. Their behavior is frequently situation-dependent. Social and psychological dysadaptation results from that the individual inadequately appraises the life situation and hence inadequately responds to the latter. The socially unacceptable behavior becomes normal up to criminogenic (theft, violence). In the homeless with tuberculosis, a change occurs in the structural hierarchy of vital activity motives by the motive-for-objective type. In this connection, there is a paradoxical attitude towards the disease for the purpose of acquiring a social benefit. In the homeless, the factors that are frustrating and inducing stress in ordinarily persons cause no emotional responses. This was a result of the mental defense worked out under constant stress.",

      "abstract": "La miastenia grave es una enfermedad autoinmune que causa debilidad y fatiga musculoesqueletica mediada por anticuerpos que atacan directamente los receptores nicotinicos de acetilcolina en las uniones neuromusculares [1]. Cerca de la mitad de los pacientes con timoma tiene sintomas consistentes con miastenia grave [2,3]. Se recomienda una timomectomia en pacientes con miastenia grave, especialmente en aquellos con control inadecuado con inhibidores de la acetilcolinesterasa y en los menores de 55 anos. Cerca de un 75% se beneficia de la cirugia, y puede mejorar o estabilizar los sintomas incluso anos despues de esta [4-7]. La miastenia grave se clasifica clinicamente en cinco clases principales. La clase I corresponde a la miastenia grave ocular. Esta involucra cualquier grado de debilidad muscular ocular, y es la fuerza del resto de los musculos del cuerpo normal [8]. La disfuncion autonomica en asociacion con miastenia grave es rara; de hecho, hay pocos casos en la bibliografia [9-12]. Los sintomas de fallo autonomico descritos son variados y de diferente gravedad. Lo mas frecuente es la gastroparesia, seguida de afectacion cardiovascular y sindrome de Sicca, generalmente de curso subagudo en relacion con el inicio de los sintomas [9-15]. A continuacion se describe un nuevo caso de miastenia grave asociada a disautonomia grave despues de timomectomia.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Patients with cauda equina syndrome (CES) are frequently referred late when neurological damage cannot be reversed. National Guidelines for emergency referral, imaging and treatment of CES contain symptoms and/or signs that are those of late often, irreversible CES. Referral at this stage may be too late for that patient.Methods: Seven sources were reviewed. Advice re emergency referral/imaging/treatment were reviewed. Symptoms/signs were compared with a standard classification of CES.Results: 37 recommendations: 12 (32%) were symptoms/signs of bilateral radiculopathy (treatment usually leads to favourable outcomes). Thirteen recommendations (35%) were described in an imprecise way (could be interpreted as early or late CES). Twelve sets of symptoms/signs (32%) were those of late, often irreversible CES where an unfavourable outcome would be expected.Conclusions: Thirty-two percent of the so-called \"red flag\" symptoms and signs of CES in seven sources were definitely those of late, irreversible CES. These could be seen as \"white flags\" [flags of defeat and surrender]. Thirty-five percent of the recommendations if interpreted pessimistically (e.g. absent perineal sensation or urinary incontinence) would also be white flags; potentially therefore two-thirds of the so-called \"red flag\" symptoms/signs of CES could be those of late irreversible CES. Only 32% of the symptoms/signs were true \"red flags\" i.e. they warn of further, avoidable damage ahead. Guidelines should be redrawn to emphasise referral of patients who are at risk of developing CES or who have early CES. It is illogical for these guidelines to emphasise the clinical features of severe, often untreatable, CES. Demand for emergency MRI will increase; MRI is part of triage and should be performed at the DGH.",

In other words, in each case, the subject described him/herself as \"being depressed.\" The detailed examination of the case notes kept by the counselors who treated these individuals indicates a more specific symptomology associated with their depression. On a more specific level, each of the subjects expressed feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, despair, and self-destruction. In at least two of the cases, self-destructive feelings were translated into potentially suicidal actions. In addition, each of the three subjects experienced pronounced mood swings. Alternating between periods of deep depression (associated with stagnant or regressive behavior) and periods of relative optimism when at least temporary progress in therapy was evident. During these apparent periods of improvement, the subjects often related major plans of action intended to improve their lot, including new jobs, furthering their education, withdrawing entirely from drug use, patching up marital and family disorder, etc. In each case before these major improvements could be initiated, the subjects would relapse into depressed states and their plans would dissolve like so many fantasies. These cyclical mood swings and their accompanying polar manifestations would seem, superficially, indicative of a type of manic-depressive illness. It should be noted, however, that at no time did any of the subjects undergo thorough psychological testing. Such testing is planned for Subject B, who remains in treatment at this time. Each subject complained of experiencing acute anxiety attacks during his periods of depression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Equilibrium disorders in elderly: diagnostic classification and differential diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Background: Balance is primarily related to the proper functioning of three sensory input: vestibular, visual and proprioceptive. The integration of these different afferences contributes to the proper attitude of the body in static and dynamic conditions. Equilibrium disorders are common among elderly patients and are responsible for falls and fractures, leading sometimes to catastrophic outcomes, representing a serious health and social problem. Approximately one third of elderly patients at home and about 50% of institutionalized, over 75 year-old, suffer from this particular condition, with at least one fall a year and almost 50% of these with recurrent episodes. Females are more affected than males. Attempts to ascertain the underlying cause of unbalance should be done, leading then to specific treatment. Nevertheless, many elderly patients do not have a single disease but rather a multitude of medical conditions which may cause dizziness, imbalance and vertigo: effects of ageing, drugs, cardiovascular and neurological disorders, ocular and orthopaedic diseases. Aim of the study: A literature review was carried out with the intention to offer practical and useful notions for the management and treatment of equilibrium disorders. Discussion: In clinical practice, the main challenge is to distinguish between peripheral and central imbalance disorders. The data collected from history and clinical exams should be integrated with the intent to include the patient in one of the following clinical conditions: vertiginous syndrome, pre-syncope and/or syncope, neurological diseases, other conditions.Conclusions: Following the differential diagnosis, treatment mainly consists in drug administration (antiemetic and vestibular suppressor drugs) and vestibular rehabilitation (physiotherapy and vestibular exercises).",

Achalasia is seen in the gastroesophageal sphincter. Partial or complete failure of contraction occurs most commonly in the esophagus. In dyskinesia, the progressive sequence of the contraction is lost, and the entire organ or a part of it contracts simultaneously. Too much contraction for too long a period causes diffuse spasm. Refinements in technics of detection should result in better definition of esophageal motor disorders and better management of patients.",

      "title": "Chapter 7 EPILEPSY AND SEIZURES: EXCITOTOXICITY OR EXCITOTROPHICITY?",
      "abstract": "Excitotoxic neuronal death has been clearly documented in the adult brain following status epilepticus (SE), a state of uninterrupted seizure activity that may last for hours . The severity and duration of SE determine the extent of neuronal injury; in most animal models damage is observed with durations of one hour or longer. Severity , duration and rate of onset may also influence the extent to which the neuronal death is mediated by apoptotic or necrotic processes. In contrast to the adult brain, the immature brain is resistant to SE-induced damage ; nevertheless long-term deleter ious effects of SE have been observed in animals that experienced SE in infancy without exhibiting neuronal loss. Likewise , in adult animals , long-term abnormalities such as spontaneous seizur es have been documented follow ing SE even under conditions in which the brain was protected from damag e. This suggests that SE-induced excitotoxic injury is not required for the development of long-term disrupt ion of neuronal function in the aftermath of SE. In contrast to SE, recurrent intermittent brief seizures such as those typicall y associated with epilepsy, do not necessar ily cause neuronal inj ury. In patients with epilepsy it is often difficult to determine whether brain lesions are a cause or consequence of the seizure condition ; little or no injury has been observed with chronic brief seizures in several animal models . In fact, exposure to repeated brief non injurious seizures has been shown to exert a neuroprotective action, possibly as a consequence of induction of expression of neurotrophic factors . This e xcitotrophic effect of seizures extends beyond protect ion against SE-induced injury to include protection in models such as adrenalectomy-induced granule cell death . It is therefore possible that seizures may serve to protect against neurodegeneration and promote regrowth and remodeling in the face of insults to the nervous system. Thus , seizures can span a spectrum from trophic and adaptive to toxic and maladaptive, depending upon the conditions of their occurrence and the extent to which they are regulated. In this context, seizures may be analogous to fever: adaptive and protective in specific settings, with the capacity to become maladaptive and injurious in their own right if they develop into SE or a long lasting epileptic condition .",

Only the mildest forms can be left untreated without risking harm to either the patient's welfare, relationships, and job, or to the well-being of those who are close to them (relatives, care givers, or staff). Severe forms constitute a psychiatric emergency, demanding immediate control including rapid tranquillization with medication. Treatment lessens the severity and shortens the duration of manic episodes, which in the pretreatment era was usually 3 to 12 months with a mean of 26 weeks. In one modern series, remission from mania occurred in 50% of manic episodes by 12 weeks (1). After the first episode of mania, the mean latency to recovery was 13.7 weeks and the median 5.4 weeks in terms of the DSM-defined syndrome of mania; 97% had recovered within two years, but only 35% had recovered in terms of personal and occupational functioning (2). The mean duration of hospitalization was 28 days.",

Moreover, independent of the influence of mental illness, substance use disorders themselves increase the risk of suicide, possibly due to alterations in neurotransmitter levels.",

      "title": "Genetic Causes of Medication-Resistant Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "The pharmacotherapy of epilepsy is a complex process guided by evidence-based research and clinical experience. Some patients achieve seizure freedom upon treatment with the first anti-seizure medication (ASM) prescribed, whereas others may be treated with two or three medications before one (or a combination) is found that reduces seizure frequency and/or severity with minimal side effects. Many patients demonstrate a partial response to treatment, leading to reduced seizure frequency and/or severity, but do not become completely seizure free. It is often stated that ~30% of epilepsy patients have seizures that cannot be controlled pharmacologically, and these patients are defined as having medication-resistant epilepsy (MRE). The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) published the following definition of MRE: ‘drug resistant epilepsy may be defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used ASM schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom’[1]. Treatment success or sustained seizure freedom is defined as one year without seizures or three times the inter-seizure interval (whichever is longer). The ILAE definition provides a useful standard from which to work, and MRE can be clinically identified in patients that fail to achieve seizure freedom after multiple ASM trials. However, the ILAE definition of successful treatment does not account for partial response to pharmacotherapy. Indeed, many partial responders have improved quality of life, even if they are not seizure-free for one year or more.",

      "title": "[Psychological effects of abortion].",
      "abstract": "A significant number of patients suffer psychological complications as a consequence of abortion, and 10-20% experience severe depression. The risk factors for such psychological complications originate with abortions performed under pressure, eugenic abortions, or late abortions, and with cultural or religious hostility against abortion. The response to abortion consists of four phases: phase 1 is short and comprises the immediate reaction and alleviation that the pregnancy is over; phase 2 can last for several weeks or months, with anxiety and even guilt being experienced by 20% of women 2 years after the abortion; phase 3 corresponds to a pathological phase, that is, when anxiety is transformed into disease in 10-20% of women (symptoms of this depressive disease include insomnia, crying, inability to concentrate, anxiety, and panic attacks); phase 4 consists of reactivated mourning. Treatment depends on the phase: for anxiety, counseling is indicated; for depression, anti-depression drugs; however, these are contraindicated in the first trimester if the patient becomes pregnant. For breast-feeding mothers, tricyclic antidepressants are indicated and during such treatment counseling should be suspended. Although the effects of such treatment methods have not been adequately assessed, it could be concluded that they do not cause any harm. The efficacy of treatment choices needs to be studied.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Transient amnesia can be the principal manifestation of epilepsy. This diagnosis, however, is seldom suspected by clinicians and remains controversial. The amnestic attacks are often associated with persistent memory complaints. This study was designed to provide the first description of transient epileptic amnesia in a substantial series of patients. Methods Fifty patients were recruited over 18 months using the following diagnostic criteria: (1) recurrent, witnessed episodes of amnesia; (2) other cognitive functions intact during attacks; and (3) compelling evidence of epilepsy. We assessed clinical features and performed neuropsychological evaluation in cases and 24 matched control subjects. Results Transient epileptic amnesia develops in later life (mean onset, 62 years). Amnestic episodes are frequent (median, 12/year), brief (median duration, 30–60 minutes), and often occur on waking (37/50 cases). Epilepsy was the initial specialist diagnosis in only 12 of 50 cases. Attacks ceased on anticonvulsant medication in 44 of 47 treated patients. A total of 40 of 50 cases described persistent memory difficulties. Despite normal performance on standard memory tests, patients exhibited accelerated forgetting of verbal and visual material over 3 weeks by comparison with matched control subjects ( p &lt; 0.001). They also showed loss of autobiographical memories for events extending back over 40 years ( p &lt; 0.05). Interpretation We propose that transient epileptic amnesia is a distinctive epilepsy syndrome, typically misdiagnosed at presentation and associated with accelerated long‐term forgetting and autobiographical amnesia. The syndrome is of clinical and theoretic importance. Ann Neurol 2007",

      "title": "Determinants of depressive symptom trajectories among older adults in community and treatment settings",
      "abstract": "Sub-diagnostic depression, sleep, and circadian rest-activity rhythm (CAR) syndromes are common in late-life, but their characteristics, prevalence, and relations to future depression are unclear. We characterized commonly occurring sleep, CAR, and depressive sign/symptom patterns using a data-driven approach applied to a large population-based study of older men. We next examined relationships of these baseline syndromes with longitudinal change in depressive symptoms. Common (32.44%) probable depressive syndromes were characterized by somatic/apathy symptoms; a subset (5.74%) with only limited somatic/apathy symptoms also had emotional-related impairment. Subjective complaints without objectively (actigraph) assessed disturbances characterized two distinct classes of men (totaling 37.46%); a pattern of objective disturbance (including greater sleep fragmentation with probable prolonged sleep latency or short (<5 hour) sleep duration) occurred in both the presence (8.87%) and absence (8.51%) of subjective complaints. Only 32.18% appeared to be free of a non-normative CAR parameter; 8 classes were distinguished by activity timing, levels, and the active period length. Baseline sleep and depression latent classes were not meaningfully associated with rates of change in depression severity. The rate of increase in depressive symptoms was higher for classes with later activity and for a class with dampened, earlier, and compressed activity combined. Future work should assess the modifiability of the identified markers of depressive symptom increases through preventative interventions. Nevertheless, there remains a need to understand of mechanisms of variability in pharmacological treatment response among older adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). We therefore assessed prognostic factors associated with distinct trajectories of depressive symptom change over 12-weeks of open-label Venlafaxine XR treatment for MDD. Only about 42% of participants exhibited a clear response, and the clinical prognostic factors linked to unique patterns of non-response included: worse depressive severity, longer illness duration, prior adequate pharmacological treatment, and worse list recognition performance. Overall, this work has public health relevance by providing a novel description of common sleep-wake/depressive syndromes in the community and distinct symptom trajectories found when pharmacologically treating MDD in the clinic. There is a need to integrate the identified prognostic markers with neurobiological research towards a valid predictive science of depression pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Being most common mental health disorder, Major depressive disorder, have affected approximately 350 million people all throughout the world at any time. In ranking among the cause of disability it has been ranked as major leading cause for disability in worldwide. (1) Major depressive disorder is debilitating disease and has and at least one individual depressive episode for minimum of two weeks and involves changed mood, decreased interest in surrounding and decreased pleasure specifically in activities which were earlier pleasurable along with changes in cognitive function and changes in vegetative symptoms (2) . few of these patient might report guilt feelings and feelings of worthlessness or feeling of hopelessness, also patient reports of repetitive negative thoughts about individual self and their future (3) . Taking consideration prevalence and the suffering, morbidity, dysfunction, and economic burden depression is major public health concern disorder. Depression being more common in women than men, report on global burden of disease suggests the point prevalence of unipolar depressive episodes is 1.9% for men and 3.2% for women, while the estimated one year prevalence to be 5.8% for men and 9.5% for women. Study says that if current trends for demographic and epidemiologic transitions continue by the year 2020, the burden of disease might increase up to 5.7% of total burden of the disease making it second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), second to ischemic heart disease. (4) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the first-line therapy for treating MDD because of their superior tolerability and safety profiles relative to monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. (6) Therapeutic application of these inhibitors is based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. Unfortunately, over half of MDD patients do not achieve remission after a 12-week treatment with SSRIs. Studies have also shown that one-third of patients treated with successive antidepressant therapies do not achieve remission even after a 1-year intervention. (7) Thus in this study we attempt to examine the better treatment amongst two groups that can help to treat our patients and improve clinical outcome.",

      "title": "Management of Antidepressant-Induced Sexual Dysfunction: A Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the mainstay of treatment for various psychiatric conditions, including but not limited to major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bulimia nervosa, sexual side effects from these medications are common. These side effects include decreased libido, difficulty with arousal and erection, and delayed or absent orgasm, which can be troubling for many patients and impact adherence to treatment and quality of life. This is an important distinction from decreased libido that can be seen in the natural course of depression; the sexual dysfunction discussed in this paper is due to an adverse effect of SSRIs. The goal of this narrative review is to explore the effectiveness of switching antidepressant therapy or adding adjunctive medications or herbal supplements in alleviating antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AISD). An electronic literature search was performed on PubMed to identify full-text, English-language articles that discussed antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (AISD). Selected articles were published between 1996 and 2023. Replacing one antidepressant class for another with a more favorable side effect profile (e.g., mirtazapine, nefazodone, and vortioxetine) may be effective for some patients, especially if the initial antidepressive treatment was not sufficient in controlling the symptoms caused by the primary mental illness. Several adjunctive medications and supplements also show promise in the management of AISD, including bupropion and saffron (Crocus sativus). Findings surrounding other adjunctive treatments are promising, though more robust studies are needed. Evidence for switching to vilazodone to treat AISD is conflicting, as is data surrounding the effect of Ginkgo biloba on AISD. Data surrounding AISD management is increasing, but remains relatively scarce. Further studies are necessary to understand AISD's pathophysiology and current interventions. Development and use of other drugs, supplements, and nonpharmacological agents should be explored in this patient population to broaden effective management options for AISD.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that involves impairment in three broad areas as identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition [1]: socialization, communication, and repetitive or restricted behaviors and interests. With regard to socialization, individuals with autism may show limited use of nonverbal behaviors, such as eye contact or facial expressions directed to others. They may demonstrate limited social and emotional reciprocity, may not seek to share their enjoyment of activities and interests with others, and often fail to develop appropriate peer relationships. In the area of communication, individuals with autism may have a significant language delay and have difficulties with symbolic play. Those individuals with strong verbal skills still tend to have communication impairments, including difficulty with reciprocal conversation, and use of unusual or repetitive language. Finally, in the area of restricted and repetitive behaviors, individuals with autism may show a preoccupation with parts of objects (e.g. repeatedly spinning the wheel of a toy car), or an intense preoccupation with an unusual topic of interest (e.g. radiators, train schedules). In some individuals, these areas of interest become almost all-consuming, such that it is difficult for them to relate to others without bringing up their preoccupation. Individuals with autism often show a need for routine and predictability, and may exhibit ritualistic behavior or become upset by disruptions in their usual routine. Finally, some individuals with autism exhibit repetitive movements, such as hand-flapping or body-rocking.",

      "title": "Need for Medical Workup in Psychiatric Assessment",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—The geropsychiatrist must have access to a complete medical evaluation as part of any initial workup. Our experience indicates that the compounded effect of medical and psychiatric problems in the elderly is additive, increasing both morbidity and mortality. In many cases, the psychiatrist will insist on additional medical workup to help in diagnosis and treatment planning.1 The geriatricians are aware of the necessity of a careful medical evaluation, preanesthesia, or preelectroconvulsive therapy as well as perioperative follow-up in a group of patients in which multiple disease is the rule and cardiovascular problems are extremely frequent. Alexopoulos, in his study of medical complications in 293 patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (September 1984) fails to demonstrate the cause-effect relationship between ECT and the so-called complications. These could be the result of multiple factors including: l)exacerbations of the patient's current or preexisting medical condition; 2) recent psychiatric or chronic psychiatric illness, causing an exacerbation of medical illnesses; or 3) the altered effect of anesthetics in the elderly. Most importantly is the possibility that ECT had no effect on the development of medical complications. A comparison of a matched population of medically ill depressed patients who received antidepressant medication and/or psychotherapy v ECT would have been more significant. The different problems cited by Alexopoulos could have occurred spontaneously. His final stressing of the need of medical evaluation in these patients is commonplace in the geriatric literature, no matter what the particular situation is, and ECT is no exception. We believe it is premature to implicate ECT as a cause of significant medical problems in this population. Electroconvulsive therapy is an important part of the therapeutic armamentarium of the geropsychiatrist, and there is a consensus in affirming that age is not a contraindication.2",

They developed symptoms in middle ages after being affected psychologically or physically. The persistent abnormal cenesthesia full of agony was rather tinged with hallucination, and it was some experience of moving, tense or pulling sensations, or of utterly new strange foreign sensations. Despite the peculiar strange complaints, they did not make pathological interpretations and their insight into their morbid states was preserved to some extent. But, pathological obsessive attitudes (such as skin-rubbing) and temporary abulic states often appeared, so that in their course they wore temporarily psychotic feature. Despite the chronic course, schizophrenic tendency did not appear.The author discussed the psychopathology of cenesthopathy and concluded that the 5th group should be diagnosed as typical cenesthopathia.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is the period of time when a fetus develops inside a woman's uterus. When counting from the last menstrual cycle through delivery, a pregnancy typically lasts around 40 weeks, or slightly over 9 months. Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, as described by healthcare professionals. First trimester: from conception to 12 weeks; second trimester: from 13 to 28 weeks; third trimester: from 29 to 40 weeks. Seizures are a defining feature of the illness, however not all seizures are caused by epilepsy, such as febrile seizures or seizures brought on by drugs. The multilevel categorization of epilepsies was developed to facilitate categorizing epilepsy in varied clinical contexts. There are three types of seizures: those with undetermined onset, generalized onset, and focal onset. The second level is epilepsy type, which introduces the new categories of generalized epilepsy, focal epilepsies, and unknown. A variety of seizure forms, including absence, myoclonic, atonic, tonic, and tonic-clonic seizures, can occur in generalized epilepsies. An epilepsy syndrome diagnosis comes in third place. An epilepsy syndrome is a collection of symptoms that includes seizure types, EEG patterns, and imaging characteristics that frequently co-occur. This review underwent a narrative evaluation, for which papers from the Cochrane library, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were gathered. Epilepsy is treated with antiepileptic medications (AEDs). There is evidence that suggests some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increase the chance of congenital malformation and induce teratology. The risk of malformation is increased by medications including carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproate, but not by lamotrigine, gabapentin, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, primidone, or zonisamide. Lacosamide, Eslicarbazepine, Clonazepam, Clobazam, and Rivaracetam did not either.",

At discharge, hypochondriasis was present in 40% of the sample, with 0% delusional. Hypochondriasis was associated with anxiety (P less than .05) and somatic concerns (P less than .001), but not with complaints of depressed mood, suicidality, or short-term outcome. In dependent physical illness ratings did not correlate with hypochondriasis, however nonpsychotropic medication use did (P less than .01). Improvement in hypochondriacal complaints with treatment, yet persistence of less intense hypochondriacal concerns after remission suggests that these features may represent an admixture of state and trait phenomena in elderly depressives.",

      "title": "Preventing and treating delirium in clinical settings for older adults",
      "abstract": "Delirium is a serious consequence of many acute or worsening chronic medical conditions, a side effect of medications, and a precipitant of worsening functional and cognitive status in older adults. It is a syndrome characterized by fluctuations in cognition and impaired attention that develops over a short period of time in response to an underlying medical condition, a substance (prescribed, over the counter, or recreational), or substance withdrawal and can be multi-factorial. We present a narrative review of the literature on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to prevention and treatment of delirium with a focus on older adults as a vulnerable population. Older adult patients are most at risk due to decreasing physiologic reserves, with delirium rates of up to 80% in critical care settings. Presentation of delirium can be hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed, making identification and study challenging as patients with hypoactive delirium are less likely to come to attention in an inpatient or long-term care setting. Studies of delirium focus on prevention and treatment with nonpharmacological or medication interventions, with the preponderance of evidence favoring multi-component nonpharmacological approaches to prevention as the most effective. Though use of antipsychotic medication in delirium is common, existing evidence does not support routine use, showing no clear benefit in clinically significant outcome measures and with evidence of harm in some studies. We therefore suggest that antipsychotics be used to treat agitation, psychosis, and distress associated with delirium at the lowest effective doses and shortest possible duration and not be considered a treatment of delirium itself. Future studies may clarify the use of other agents, such as melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, alpha-2 receptor agonists, and anti-epileptics.",

It can occur in any workplace environment, but, in the past several years, its prevalence in the healthcare industry has gained more attention. Burnout has been defined as consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Up to 40% of physicians have reported burnout. Risk factors that contribute to physician burnout include female gender, young age, long working hours, low job satisfaction, and presence of a work–home conflict. Physical activity, mindfulness, and institutional wellness programs that include cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management may reduce the prevalence of burnout in healthcare workers.",

Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

      "title": "Relapsing–remitting and primary progressive MS have the same cause(s)- the neuropathologist’s view: 2",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to clinical symptoms, neuroradiological findings and treatment responses. The obvious differences in disease courses between patients led to the classification of MS as either relapsing–remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS). The majority of patients starts with a relapsing–remitting disease course characterized by acute exacerbation followed by partial or total recovery; whereas PPMS is associated with a continuous worsening of symptoms and is only observed in about 10–15% of the patients. However, even the clinical presentation does not always allow clear separation between RRMS or PPMS, since some MS patients start with a progressive disease course after a single or few relapses or suffer from a progressive disease from the beginning superimposed by few relapses. The subsequent rate of disease progression is comparable in SPMS and PPMS and is not affected by relapses as soon as a certain Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score is reached. 1 Only about 50% of siblings with MS show an identical disease course. The recently identified susceptibility genes, each of which each contributes less than 1% of disease risk, are comparably distributed in RRMS and PPMS. 2 These epidemiological findings suggest that the different disease courses represent different ends of a disease spectrum rather than different diseases or disease etiologies. This point of view is supported by histopathological and imaging studies that describe quantitative rather than qualitative differences between different clinical courses. Although no fundamental differences have been identified between patients with either RRMS/SPMS or PPMS, this does not mean that the same pathomechansims are responsible for clinical symptoms in all MS patients. The histopathological hallmarks of MS change with disease duration. Whereas the development of new focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions in grey and white matter dominate the pathology at the beginning of the disease, the progressive disease phase is characterized by diffuse white matter abnormalities, accumulation of axonal loss in demyelinated as well as normal-appearing white matter and limited remyelination. The relapses are believed to be the consequences of focal inflammatory lesions whereas recovery may be induced by resolution of inflammation and edema, increased plasticity and endogenous repair mechanisms such as remyelination. RRMS patients develop numerous contrastenhancing lesions which presumably represent actively demyelinating lesions and the number of newly developing lesions decrease with disease duration. 3 This point of view is supported by histological studies which demonstrate a higher number of actively demyelinating lesions in RRMS than in SPMS. Patients with PPMS also develop contrastenhancing lesions and this is associated with a more rapid progression of disease. 4 Not surprisingly, actively demyelinating lesions can also be found in patients with PPMS. 3 These highly inflammatory lesions, observed in the early disease stages, are heterogeneous with respect to composition of inflammation and extent of initial oligodendroglial cell death, suggesting that different pathomechanisms may lead to demyelination. However, these different histological patterns described by Lucchinetti et al. are not predictive for the clinical disease course. 5 Due to the accumulation of new lesions, the extent of demyelination increases with disease duration: histopathological and imaging studies show that patients with PPMS tend to have comparable lesion loads to RRMS or SPMS patients but that the lesions",

When violence is perpetuated, the woman presents cognitive distortions, low self-esteem and, at other times, feelings of guilt and helplessness. Lastly, the battered woman finds herself in a situation of social isolation and dependence on her attacker, which will again affect her self-esteem, deprive her of adequate social support, and increase her feeling of the attacker’s power and control. In accordance with the different theories, all of these phenomena may act, separately or together, as etiopathogenic sources of depression, increasing the probability of this disorder appearing in women who are victims of domestic violence.",

      "abstract": "Like for other side effects oral contraceptives are often blamed for inducing depressive illness. Psychiatric literature and own data permit the following statements: 1. OC's do not induce psychiatric symptoms like depression on a pharmacological basis. 2. There is no preponderance of psychiatric symptoms during pill use. 3. If there is any effect on mood, initiative or affection this is more likely to be mentioned in patients with psychiatric history. 4. The indication for oral contraception in neurotic-psychopathic personalities should be considered seriously. 5. There is a positive secondary psychotropic effect of OC's via improving acne, bleeding irregularities and dysmenorrhoea.Psychotropic effects have been imputed to oral contraceptives (OCs); however, studies with large populations found no depressive episodes caused by OCs. Affective disorders of women such as premenstrual syndrome and postpartum and menopausal depression are well-known. The estrogen and progesterone levels are high during pregnancy, when the risk of emotional disease declines. A study on Marvelon (containing .15 mg of desogestrel and .03 mg of ethinyl estradiol) involving 27,000 women found a history of depression in 3%, but in 90% the symptoms disappeared after OC use. Other studies corroborated the finding that OCs exerted a stabilizing effect on emotional disorders. The overwhelming majority of women without psychiatric anamnesis did not suffer any mood fluctuations under OC use. In a study, 4327 women were interviewed at 3 and 6 months of OC use, and in 45.7% their sense of well-being improved, 30.3% were in a good frame of mind, and 21.2% had a slight deterioration of their sense of well-being. Neurotic and introverted persons tended to attribute affective disorders, weakness of concentration, sleep disturbances, and the avoidance of sex to OCs. With such individuals, OC indication requires particularly strict adherence to rules. The ability of Ocs to improve acne was analyzed when 1785 questionnaires were examined from 1958 women who had used Marvelon. 60% reported improvement of their acne, and 50% of the more severe cases improved. Dysmenorrhea and menstrual cycle disorders improved similarly. Body weight increase in insignificant with modern OCs. OCs exert a positive psychotropic effect through their ability to influence these conditions.",

Repeat in‐hospital observation and laboratory electrophysiologic functional testing did not elucidate the origin of the symptoms. Prolonged Holler monitoring finally showed that the syncopal attacks were caused by a sick sinus syndrome (SSS). On electrophysiologic study, a concealed rate‐dependent unidirectional antegrade accessory A‐V pathway (AP) was found to be present. The AP was an incidental finding and was unrelated to the patient's symptoms. The symptomatic SSS may occur in the young as well as in the elderly. Sinoatrial dysfunction may be intermittent and difficult to detect, may cause severe symptoms, and may even be life‐threatening. Prior to definitive therapy (such as the permanent implantation of a pacemaker), the importance of relating symptoms to a rhythm disturbance has been stressed.

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects approximately 121 million people worldwide, including almost 15 million American adults.1,2 Among all medical conditions, MDD is the leading cause of morbidity worldwide as well as the leading cause of disability in the U.S. in individuals 15 to 44 years of age.2,3 Antidepressants were the fourth most commonly prescribed drug class in 2009, with prescription sales in the U.S. reaching $9.9 billion.4\r\n\r\nPatients with MDD present with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. The underlying pathophysiology of MDD has not been clearly defined, although clinical studies suggest that the disorder results from a disturbance in serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS).5–7\r\n\r\nSuccessful pharmacological treatment of depression depends on such factors as tolerability and treatment resistance along with drug efficacy. Up to 50% of depressive patients do not respond adequately to initial pharmacotherapy.8 However, patients who do not respond to one antidepressant might derive benefit from another one, even if it belongs to the same therapeutic class.\r\n\r\nResearch continues to be directed toward the development of antidepressant drugs with improvements in efficacy and side-effect profiles. The clinical need exists for new antidepressants with novel mechanisms of action. Vilazodone (Viibryd, Forest/Trovis) offers a novel combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition and serotonergic (5-HT1A) receptor partial agonist activity.9 Because of these characteristics, vilazodone has been termed a serotonin partial agonist–reuptake inhibitor (SPARI). Vilazodone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of MDD in January 2011.10",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are frequent in dementia and often precede cognitive dysfunction. Their prevalence is difficult to establish because of differences in definitions, methodology, scales or origin of information. They result from a dysfunction in fronto-subcortical, striato-limbic and paralimbic structures involved in neurodegenerative disorders. In elderly people, 40-70% of the population has a mood disorder, and among them 15-25% a major depression. Accompanied cognitive deficits constitute the debated entity of pseudodementia or dementia syndrome of depression. This is a fuzzy field and the reversibility of the cognitive deficits is far from having been proved, 60-89% of tardive depression evolve toward dementia and only 5% of depressive state are identified as the first symptom of dementia or interpreted as changes in personality; no test or brain imaging technique can help in the diagnosis. Depression is the second most symptom in Alzheimer's disease and a common presenting symptom with a continuum between dysthymia (20-50%) and major depression (10-30%) and has even been interpreted as a factor for Alzheimer's disease. Apathy (50-80%), verbal aggressivity, agitation (40-60% ), emotional lability or abrupt changes in mood, irritability and violence are commonly associated with mood disorders in Alzheimer's disease. Anxiety is frequent (4%), but manic states or euphoria are exceptional. With the evolution of the disease, the prevalence of depression decreases. In Lewy body disease the prevalence of depression is the same as in Alzheimer's disease, anxiety is less frequent, violence is reported in 20%, psychomotor agitation in 60%. In fronto-temporal dementia changes in personality and social or instinctual behaviour are accompanied by some degree of depression (80% ), apathy (50-70%), disinhibition, insouciant euphoria (10-30%), loss of empathy or concern about the consequence of one's acts, blunting of affectivity, irritability or disorders of impulse control and sometimes manic states. In vascular dementia depression is more frequent than in Alzheimer's disease, apathy and mood fluctuations also. AIDS dementia is mostly apathetic or manic. Parkinsonism and dementia associate apathy and depression, anxiety and dysphoric states. In Huntington's chorea, disorders of impulse control, anxiety and severe depression with a risk of suicide 8-10 times higher than in the normal population are frequent in the beginning of the disease. Apathy is generally found in terminal stages of the disease. Multiple sclerosis with cognitive deficits, dementia due to sarcoidosis, Behcet's, Whipple's and Sjogren's diseases and idiopathic calcification of the basal ganglia are associated with depression, aggressivity, irritability and manic states. Occasionally, B 1 2 deficiency can present with depression or mania, hydrocephaly is commonly associated with depression and apathy. Wilson's disease is known to present with disorders of impulse control, depression, anxiety, emotional lability, aggressivity, apathy or manic states. Treatment of mood disorders in dementia generally responds to tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs or adrenergic selective antidepressants. Agitation is best treated with clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine and risperidone, but the latter and classic neuroleptics may be harmful in Lewy body disease. Paradoxical reactions to sedatives are sometimes encountered, but diazepines and clomethiazole may be used.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, affective/emotional disorders and exposure to adverse life circumstances are the main sources of psychological impairment in school age children. They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

The findings suggest that burnout can take place among representatives of older age and more it is continued, provided professional activities. The cessation of the work activities leads to stress, often with the subsequent development post-traumatic stress disorder and stress-induced diseases. However in this case the clinical symptoms of the syndrome of emotional burnout, does not disappear, but only happens their clinical transformation attach various psychosomatic disorders. Thus, the elderly, suffering the syndrome of emotional burnout, are at high risk group with regard to the formation and development of diseases, associated with stress and require close monitoring in the framework of the compulsory program of medical examination.В статье представлены результаты сравнительного исследования клинических проявлений синдрома эмоционального выгорания у 84 работающих по специальности врачей-терапевтов женщин пожилого возраста и 48 официально прекративших работу по данной специальности. Полученные данные указывают на то, что синдром эмоционального выгорания может иметь место у лиц пожилого возраста, и он более всего связан с продолжающейся профессиональной деятельностью. Прекращение данной трудовой деятельности приводит к стрессу, нередко с последующим развитием посттравматического стрессового расстройства и стресс-индуцированных заболеваний. При этом клинические проявления самого синдрома эмоционального выгорания не исчезают, а лишь трансформируются с присоединением различных психосоматических нарушений. Таким образом, пожилые, страдающие синдромом эмоционального выгорания, являются группой риска в отношении формирования и развития заболеваний, связанных со стрессом, и нуждаются в пристальном наблюдении в рамках обязательной программы диспансеризации.",

Younger males are overrepresented in much of the data that shows causal relationships. A clear dose-response association can be seen in many accident cases concerning both accident risk and severity. The correlation is not as clear in cases of violence. However, the causal relationships between alcohol and accidents or violence may be difficult to evaluate. Factors such as the abuse of other drugs, unemployment, and other sociodemo-graphic factors must be taken into account.

It is a developmental disorder of psychomotor skills that is manifested by impaired attention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. This disorder is characterized by early onset, the association of hyperactive and poorly coordinated behavior with marked inattention and lack of perseverance in performing tasks; and this behavior occurs in all situations and persists over time. This disorder is inappropriate for the child’s developmental age and maladaptive. Disorders of neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain with discrete neurological changes can lead to behavioral difficulties and other psychological problems. Most children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder have comorbidities, often multiple comorbid conditions in the same person. Comorbidity was observed in both clinical and epidemiological samples. It is estimated that about two-thirds of children with this disorder have at least one other psychiatric disorder diagnosed. Symptoms persist and lead to significant difficulties in the daily functioning of the child, such as school success, social interactions, family and social functioning, etc. Recent studies indicate the presence of various neuroophthalmological disorders in children and adolescents with ADHD. The most common comorbidities in children and adolescents with ADHD that will be covered in this chapter are autism spectrum disorder, mood disorder, anxiety, learning disabilities, conduct disorders, tics disorder and epilepsy.",

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

Mostly, several symptoms together are forming a multiple somatoform syndrome. As well known from other psychogenic disorders, spontaneous long-term course of somatoform symptoms is variable due to the psychic co-morbidity (in particular anxiety and depression) and a strong tendency to symptomatic shift. The long-term course of total impairment by additional psychogenic symptoms is rather bad in somatoform disorders. Clinically significant personality traits and traumatic influences during early childhood development are correlated with somatoform disorders. Within the traditional role patterns of the relation between physician and patient, somatoform complaints often communicate or indicate a psychodynamic conflict.

      "title": "Editor’s Spotlight/Take 5: How Is the Probability of Reporting Various Levels of Pain 12 Months After Noncatastrophic Injuries Associated with the Level of Peritraumatic Distress?",
      "abstract": "As someone whose practice consists principally of elective orthopaedic surgery, I’ve become absolutely convinced that the most important thing people like me get wrong is when we offer discretionary procedures to patients who have, along with their musculoskeletal conditions, poorly controlled anxiety or depression. Patients with untreated psychological distress are at greater risk of developing persistent pain, clinical dissatisfaction, or a serious complication after arthroplasty than are patients who smoke or those who have morbid obesity [9, 12, 13]—two conditions that surgeons screen for aggressively [10]. The association between psychological distress before surgery with persistent pain and clinical dissatisfaction afterward has likewise been observed in procedures performed by spine [15], shoulder [16], and sports specialists [3, 5]. It shouldn’t surprise us that the human condition trumps conditions of the musculoskeletal system, and that these findings probably apply to most or all orthopaedic surgery. Yet few orthopaedic surgeons I know screen for depression, anxiety, and related conditions. Many have told me they feel it’s beyond their expertise, or that it just takes too long to use the available screening tools. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were an easy-to-use questionnaire that could identify which specific patients were at risk for persistent pain after the kinds of orthopaedic treatment that really ought to go well? In this month’s Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research®, a group from Western University in London, ON, Canada, share just such a tool. The Traumatic Injuries Distress Scale (TIDS) takes less than 3 minutes to complete, and in this study [7], it reliably anticipated which patients who presented with noncatastrophic orthopaedic injuries—defined as injuries not treated surgically or with hospitalization, events from which we expect patients to recovery fully and easily—were more likely still to have pain a year later. The TIDS (Fig. 1) focuses on patients’ self-perceived relationships to pain, as well as issues of affect, intrusive thoughts, and hyperarousal. Importantly, you don’t need any special expertise to be able to use it. Patients self-administer the simple, short questionnaire, and 3 minutes later, surgeons have a robust measure of risk; no psychology consult or on-site expert needed. In this study, patients with minor injuries who scored less than 5 of 24 on the scale had only a 1 in 10 chance of still having pain 12 months after injury, while the risk increased to 30% among those who scored 13 or more.Fig. 1: TIDS questionnaire.

Email [email protected] for inquiries. ©David M. Walton, Western University.Obviously, investigators can and should replicate these findings in patients undergoing other procedures, including major surgery, but I have a strong suspicion the findings will persist across a wide range of conditions and operations. Human knees, shoulders, and spines split the rent with human souls, and if those souls are distressed, it probably matters little what procedures we perform on the bones. As a worthy aside, the analytic approach (quantile regression) used by this research team, which was led by David M. Walton PhD (Fig. 2), is one I’ve not seen or used before, and it strikes me that this approach can help us answer a host of pressing problems in clinical research. But as with so many tools, it helps to know something about its strengths and soft spots.Fig. 2: David M. Walton PhDFor all those reasons and others, I hope you’ll join me as I go behind the discovery in the Take 5 interview that follows with Dr. Walton, senior author of “How Is the Probability of Reporting Various Levels of Pain 12 Months After Noncatastrophic Injuries Associated with the Level of Peritraumatic Distress?” [7]. I should add that this paper was published as part of the selected proceedings of the first meeting of the International Musculoskeletal Mental and Social Health (I-MESH) Consortium [11]; it’s accompanied by a number of other papers that I think are just as fun to read and informative. I hope you’ll enjoy them as much as I did. Because it was so successful, CORR® anticipates covering I-MESH-2 around this time next year. And as always, I hope you’ll send your thoughts and questions about this paper to CORR in the form of a letter to the editor, which you can email to [email protected]g. Take 5 Interview with David M. Walton PhD, senior author of “How Is the Probability of Reporting Various Levels of Pain 12 Months After Noncatastrophic Injuries Associated with the Level of Peritraumatic Distress?” Seth S. Leopold MD:Congratulations on this important and thought-provoking paper. This is one of those studies that sent my mind racing in many directions at once because it offers so many ways to change and improve patient care. How have providers at your participating study centers started to incorporate your discoveries vis-à-vis the TIDS tool into their practices? David M. Walton PhD: That’s a slightly more difficult question to answer than you might think. In the interest of equity to access, we made the decision some years ago to make the tool freely available to anyone interested—private, public, industry, or otherwise. While this is great for ensuring that useful work makes it into the clinical arena where it can be implemented to help patients, it has the disadvantage of meaning that we tend to lose track of just where it’s going and who is using it. I know, for example, that one of our team members, Dr. Modarresi, has recently completed a cross-cultural translation of the tool into a Persian version published online in the Journal of Advanced Medical Sciences and Applied Technologies [8], and I’ve just submitted a manuscript for review in which I worked with a clinician in Chile to create a Spanish version. The TIDS tool has also been programmed into the Focus on Therapeutic Outcomes (FOTO) online outcome measures platform [4], which is one of the largest platforms used by physical therapists in the United States. We’ve heard from clinicians in Canada, the United States, Ireland, Australia, and other regions who’ve indicated that they’re interested in using the TIDS. I should note that this is not the only such prognostic tool available, and I encourage your readers to seek out others such as the Keele STarT Back Tool [14] or the Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire [6] to determine the best tool for their context. I believe that prognostic screening tools are becoming increasingly used and that the best ones are those that provide clinicians with not only the magnitude of risk that a patient may not recover quickly, but perhaps even more importantly, the reasons for that risk, especially if those are potentially modifiable. That was the vision I had when initially developing the TIDS. Dr. Leopold:I recently heard a podcast in which David Ring MD, PhD was interviewed. Dr. Ring is a Deputy Editor at CORR, as well as a co–guest editor of the CORR proceedings in which the current paper appears, and so I consider his insights germane on this topic. In that interview, Dr. Ring said that orthopaedic surgeons have an ethical duty to get the diagnosis of all the mental, social, and physical health opportunities correct; to correctly prioritize them; and to address each of them in parallel rather than in series[2]. From where I sit, the fact that so much elective surgery is performed on patients with untreated or inelegantly managed anxiety and depression is evidence that we’re not living up to this ethical imperative in practice. How might discoveries like yours help surgeons—who are not experts in the diagnosis or treatment of conditions that cause psychological distress—to do better? Dr. Walton: There are a few different ways to consider this. First, it bears mentioning that not everyone with a mental health disorder will develop chronic pain, and not everyone with chronic pain has a mental health disorder. This is important because many of the current models of chronic pain development have centered on the mental health component, and as a result, some people have misinterpreted those models to blame patients who develop chronic pain for their own condition, as though they were somehow “thinking wrong”. This is partly where I hope the TIDS can nuance that conversation slightly. The subscales in particular, which were not a main focus of this paper, are intended to help clinicians better identify priority areas for intervention in those patients deemed higher risk of chronic pain. For context, those subscales are: Uncontrolled Pain (the best predictor of persistent pain at 12 months), Negative Affect (the best predictor of depression scores at 12 months), and Intrusion/Hyperarousal (the best predictor of PTSD-like symptoms at 12 months). Our hope is that even in the absence of a frank psychiatric diagnosis, clinicians can use a scale like the TIDS to facilitate early intervention; if the patient indicates that since the trauma or injury the patient feels less motivated to get up and start a new day or feels detached from the rest of the world, this should ideally cue a clinician to consider a consult to a mental health professional early so those feelings can be addressed before they become resistant to treatment. The other part of this answer is to remind all clinicians that the most recent estimates I’ve seen indicate that some 20% to 30% of the North American adult population lives with a mental health disorder [1], and at minimum, these should be acknowledged for their impact on the patient’s sense of health and wellness. Even better, we encourage clinicians to adopt more trauma-informed ways of practice when engaging with their patients to manage the experiences of distress from trauma, whether that be an injury or a surgical procedure. Dr. Leopold:It’s probably not reasonable for a spine surgeon, a shoulder surgeon, or a knee surgeon to use the actual numeric thresholds in your paper (the specific TIDS scores that you found were associated with increased risk of persistent pain), since those thresholds were derived from patients with relatively minor injuries and who did not have surgery. At the same time, it seems very reasonable for them to begin to get some experience using the tool in their practices. How might they do this in a way that is practical and informative? Related to this, in the absence of specific data in those yet-unstudied clinical settings, is there other research to suggest what TIDS score might be “high enough” to trigger at least a conversation about delaying elective surgery and pursuing treatment for emotional distress in advance of orthopaedic surgical interventions? Dr. Walton: I’ll be cautious in my reply as I wish to avoid editorializing here and would prefer to adhere to the data we have available. So, while I do believe there is value in administering the TIDS in the acute (within a few days to a few weeks) postoperative stage to identify those subscale areas that require greater attention as described above, as of right now, I am compelled to state that I cannot prove that position empirically, and that this represents a priority area of further investigation. However, for those who do wish to explore the relative value of different cut-off scores, I encourage readers to consider those reported in this paper, or seek out another recent paper we’ve published [17] for a description of other potentially useful cut-off scores. I would add that a colleague of mine is currently working on a project in which the TIDS is being used to predict recovery trajectories following distal radius fracture with or without surgical correction, and I’d expect those data to be available sometime in 2022. I’ve also been in contact with some local spine surgeons interested in using it in their practice, but so far it seems the majority of use has been in rehabilitation settings. If readers are interested in implementing the tool within their settings and turning that into a formal research project, I encourage them to reach out to me directly: [email protected]. Dr. Leopold:What’s the best way to use the TIDS in the flow of a busy clinic, and is the approach to all patients with high TIDS scores pretty similar—is it always a psychiatry consult and/or phone call back to the patient’s primary care physician—or does it matter which questions on the TIDS resulted in the high scores? How do you parse out TIDS scores that you find worrisome? I pray that it’s easy, as some surgeons seem to be looking for a way not to make this our business, and I think we need to. Dr. Walton: As with any such tool, the more you use it the quicker and easier it gets to interpret. However, I will say that our current analysis using quantile regression indicates that while full interpretation is somewhat more challenging than a simple sum, for the purposes of quick clinical use, a simple sum usually will do. Generally speaking, my recommendation is to score the items, and a total score of 11 or greater should spark a slightly deeper look. From there, I encourage clinicians to consider the subscale scores, which will answer part of the “why, and what should I do about it?” question. Fortunately, I’ve created a very simple Google Sheet for this purpose that anyone can access from here as long as they only enter scores in the gray box: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FG7S_hX1d1s59WcEbz9-50Isph7DGXJRGgw7qVceWEI/edit?usp=sharing. The question of what to do about it can be dictated by those subscales; if the patient’s distress seems to be driven largely by a sense that he or she is unable to control their pain, then looking at the strategies the patient is using now and working on a personalized pain management plan is a logical first step. If the patient describes considerable negative mood/affect, then a psych referral may be of value, though my suggestion would instead be to explore that with another simple screening tool, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as a depression screen, which as the name implies is only 9 items long. If that tool also indicates a major depressive disorder may be present, then I would think a clinician can partner with the patient to identify an appropriate path forward that may or may not include formal psychological counseling or psychiatric treatment. If Intrusion/Hyperarousal seems to be the dominant driver, then again, I would encourage the clinician to explore that further; perhaps administer something like the PTSD Diagnosis Scale or another such tool, which can be administered by a nurse or other support personnel. Importantly, however, I encourage surgeons to educate themselves on mental health issues and how to respond appropriately. They’re likely quite right that their training has not been adequate to prepare them to respond to disclosures of, for example, thoughts of self-harm or death. But recalling that somewhere between 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 patients they see daily will live with a mental health disorder, there are fewer and fewer reasons for them not to take the initiative to prepare themselves. Dr. Leopold:Let’s conclude with your analytic approach, quantile regression, which I’ll admit was unfamiliar to me, and I’ve been in this chair for nearly 10 years. Why is it so well hidden, what do you see as its advantages and liabilities, and where is the low-hanging fruit; where will readers see it used next? Dr. Walton: I’ll fully admit that this analysis was driven by my former PhD student Dr. Shirin Modarresi, and I too needed some time to fully understand it. We had already shown in prior work that the TIDS had prognostic value when predicting recovery trajectories after MSK trauma [17, 18]. Those prior analyses, however, assumed a fairly simple linear association, so Dr. Modarresi convinced me that quantile regression was a worthwhile secondary analysis. I’m glad she did, because I quite like what it has found. Interestingly, the technique has been around since the 1970s, but only recently has found increasing use in health research, having been introduced into common statistical packages like SPSS in 2019. Importantly for my answer to this question, I believe there is both value but also potential danger in labeling a patient as “at risk,” so the more accurate we can be in how we interpret such scales the better. It bears mentioning, however, that all such results are probabilistic—there are many variables, both internal and external to the patient, that will affect their recovery beyond their scores on a self-report scale. Quantile regression allows the relationship between variables to vary across the entire population rather than relying on the mean of the data that ordinary least squares (OLS) approaches require. In practice, this means we are less constrained by interpreting research results in relation to only the “average” patient, whoever those people are. I believe that the common assumption of linear associations between different health indicators in humans is problematic, so the quantile regression approach has allowed us to explore these associations with much greater granularity. Using our paper as an illustrative example [7], we found that if people report a low TIDS score within the first few weeks of an injury, and if they subsequently develop or report a chronic pain problem 12 months later, then the genesis of that chronic pain was probably not related to baseline distress; something else must have been at play. On the other hand, those who reported a high baseline TIDS score and reported persistent pain 12 months later showed a much stronger relationship, suggesting distress was a strong driving factor. If we were to put this in the context of orthopedic surgery, we know that joint arthroplasty outcomes tend to be good on average, but there remains a small subset of the population who experience problematic outcomes. This presents a problem in normal OLS-based linear regression due to the non-normal distribution of outcomes. Quantile regression relaxes these assumptions by modeling the entire conditional distribution of outcomes and predictors, offering protection against spurious findings due to non-normal data. As we continue to further explore these associations across different populations, a logical extension of this work will be to evaluate the effectiveness of addressing post-trauma distress in those with higher TIDS scores, while in those with lower distress, clinicians can probably take a more hands-off approach.",

In contrast to what have been previously described as “subaffective disorders,” the condition presented here develops later in life, after a premorbid history of high social function and after long-lasting stresses or multiple losses before onset. Long-term course is that of an affective disorder, sometimes ending in suicide if not treated. It is also suggested that these patients undergo a process of regression under the influence of a chronic exposure to stress. The condition was initially observed among Eastern European immigrant patients but may also occur among individuals in high-stress jobs.

      "title": "Uncomplicated depression is normal sadness, not depressive disorder: further evidence from the NESARC",
      "abstract": "We write to update the results of our recent paper 1 suggesting that uncomplicated depressive episodes are not in fact disorders and should be excluded from the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). We also address some concerns expressed about our claims. The concept of \"uncomplicated depression\" is essentially a generalization to all stressors of the \"bereavement exclusion\" that appeared in DSM-IV (and was eliminated in DSM-5). Uncomplicated depression is defined as a response to a stressor that satisfies current DSM-5 five-symptoms-for-two-weeks criteria for MDD but is better explainable as a normal distress response, as evidenced by the fact that it lasts no longer than six months and does not include any of the following pathosuggestive symptoms: marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, and psychomotor retardation. Uncomplicated episodes thus contain only depressive symptoms common in general distress reactions (e.g., sadness, moderate withdrawal or role impairment, decreased interest in usual activities, insomnia, decreased appetite, difficulty concentrating, fatigue). In our recent paper 1, using longitudinal data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study 2, we found that in those with lifetime uncomplicated MDD at baseline, the one-year recurrence rate (3.4%) was not significantly different from the background MDD incidence rate in those who never previously had MDD (1.7%), but both were dramatically lower than recurrence rates in other (\"complicated\") MDD (14.6%). Thus, in terms of recurrence risk, uncomplicated MDD is different from other MDD but indistinguishable from no-MDD-history. We concluded that \"consideration should be given to eliminating uncomplicated episodes as a class from MDD diagnosis\". However, that study had several limitations. We 3 therefore replicated and broadened the analysis using an entirely different, more recently collected longitudinal community data set – the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, 4) – that allowed a more clinically meaningful 3-year follow-up window and use of an expanded set of three clinically important validators (depression recurrence, suicide attempt, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), as well as other advantages in measuring impairment and clinical significance. Due to data-set limitations, only single-episode uncomplicated cases could be evaluated in this study. The results were that people with single-episode uncomplicated major depression had rates during follow-up of MDD recurrence (6.9%), GAD (4.3%), and suicide attempt (0.1%) that were not significantly different from background rates for those who never had MDD (6.1%, 2.7%, and 0.3%, respectively), but were dramatically and significantly lower than rates for both single-episode complicated cases (19.5%, 7.8%, and 0.8%, respectively) and multiple-episode cases (27.1%, 11.2%, and 1.7%, respectively) 3. The results were not explainable by group differences in severity or treatment rates. Given the replication's success, we concluded that uncomplicated MDD is a benign condition that is typologically distinct from the rest of MDD, thus supporting our earlier thesis that uncomplicated MDD is in fact a form of normal sadness. However, in a commentary on the replication, Maj 5 expressed some concerns about the evidence provided by our study. These previously unaddressed concerns are now considered. In MDD, the quality of remission, and especially the number of residual depressive symptoms, is important both because subthreshold depression is harmful in itself and such symptoms predict recurrence and may indicate a latent pathology. Yet, Maj notes, our studies did not report the residual symptom levels among those not experiencing MDD during the follow-up. To address this concern, we analyzed the average number of MDD symptom groups experienced during follow-up by individuals in each of our baseline MDD groups who did not have recurrences during the follow-up period. In each of the four baseline wave 1 lifetime MDD history groups, the mean number of residual symptom groups experienced by those who had no wave 2 recurrences during the 3-year follow-up period was: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.35-0.39) for the no lifetime MDD history group (N=25,514); 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=379); 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=1,756); and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91-1.10) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=1,876). Thus, there is not a significant difference in the number of symptoms during follow-up between the no-MDD-history group and the uncomplicated single episode MDD group. There is no \"residual symptom\" problem indicating implicit pathology or risk of recurrence among the uncomplicated group above the non-MDD baseline. In contrast, the complicated single episode and multiple episode groups both experienced significantly higher residual symptom levels than the no-history and uncomplicated single episode groups. In sum, recovery in uncomplicated depression generally returns to population baseline levels of depressive symptoms, which is unlike the recoveries of those with other MDD. Maj 5 also argued that the 3-year follow-up may have been too short to detect recurrences in uncomplicated cases because recurrence after recovery can occur after longer intervals. He noted, for instance, that in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study, the median time to first recurrence of MDD in people who had fully recovered from their index episode was over 4 years 6. However, the baseline NESARC data used in our study were lifetime MDD data at interview 1. Thus, the duration of the follow-up was not just three years. In fact, many of the individuals classified with lifetime MDD at wave 1 had not had their last MDD episode for some years prior to the wave 1 interview, so the average time interval since recovery was potentially much greater than three years. Thus, to address Maj's concern, we calculated for each of our MDD groups the average time from the end of the last episode to the wave 1 interview to obtain a more accurate approximation of the time intervals from the last episode to the outcome reported for wave 2. The mean years of remission prior to wave 1 assessment for each group were: 9.1 (95% CI: 7.9-10.3) for the lifetime uncomplicated single episode group (N=417); 9.1 (95% CI: 8.6-9.6) for the lifetime complicated single episode group (N=2128); and 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.2) for the lifetime multiple episodes group (N=2501). Thus, the average time from the end of the last episode to the beginning of the wave 2 follow-up period was lengthy, about nine years for both uncomplicated and complicated single-episode cases and about four years for multiple episode cases. This substantial time interval is more than enough for elevated recurrence rates to emerge during the examined 3-year window, and such elevated rates did occur for the single-episode complicated cases but not for the uncomplicated cases at the same 9-year average time since the baseline episode. Our recent replication and extension 3 of our earlier results 1 supports the predictive validity of the uncomplicated versus complicated depression distinction across stressors, supplementing a previous study supporting concurrent validity 7. A course with elevated recurrence relative to population baselines is generally considered the single most salient identifying feature of depressive disorder versus normal sadness 8 and a primary rationale for inferring underlying dysfunction 9, yet no such elevation occurs for uncomplicated depression. The evidence thus supports two conclusions. First, uncomplicated depression is not similar to, and is typologically distinct from, major depressive disorder. Second, given the lack of differences between uncomplicated depression and no history of MDD in crucial negative sequelae including recurrence, suicide attempt, and GAD, uncomplicated depression is best interpreted as an intense normal emotional episode. The additional analyses presented here in response to Maj's 5 concerns regarding quality of recovery and duration of follow-up substantially strengthen the support for these conclusions. Jerome C.

      "title": "Mental illness and cognition in relation to age at puberty: a hypothesis",
      "abstract": "Onset of puberty is usually considered to coincide with the last major step in brain development: the elimination of some 40% of neuronal synapses. Mean pubertal age has declined by some 4 years during the last 100 years. There is a relation between age at puberty and body build, and between body build and mental illness. The difference in body build between schizophrenia (S) and manic‐depressive psychosis (MDP) is similar to that between late and early maturers. It is suggested that S affects late‐maturing individuals and MDP very early maturers. The observed marked rise in MDP and decline in the most malignant forms of S (non‐paranoid) are in agreement with MDP and S as neurodevelopmental disorders occurring at the extremes of maturation. Maturational irregularities are most likely to occur at the extremes, and it is suggested that abbreviation of the regressive process may have led to persistent redundancy of neuronal synapses in MDP and that prolongation of the process past the optimal has yielded an inadequate synaptic density in S. The lack of cerebral abnormality in the majority of MDP and the presence of only subtle structural deficits in S, are in agreement with this. The two disorders are probably as old as mankind, and early puberty is the necessary factor for the development of MDP and late puberty is the necessary factor for that of S. There is an inverse relation between spatial ability and rate of maturation, whereas verbal ability is unaffected by maturational rate. From a previous predominance in both sexes, spatial ability (Performance IQ scores) has been reduced to below verbal ability (Verbal IQ scores) in the female sex and in early maturing males.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Idiopathic cervical dystonia (ICD) is the largest subgroup of dystonia. Psychological stress as a triggering factor has long been discussed, but detailed descriptions are lacking. We report on a group of 13 patients with ICD and preceding excessive psychological stress (age at ICD onset 39.0 ± 13.9 years, 7 females, 6 males). The observation period was 7.8 ± 5.0 years. Excessive psychological stress included partner conflicts (divorce and separation, domestic violence), special familial burdens, legal disputes and migration. It started 8.3 ± 3.9 months before ICD onset. In 85% of our patients (typical cases), ICD developed within 5.8 ± 4.4 weeks, then lasted 18.5 ± 8.3 months, before it started to remit 2.7 ± 0.8 years after its onset to 54.5 ± 35.3% of its maximal severity. Idiopathic dystonia is thought to be based upon a genetic predisposition triggered by epigenetic factors. Our study suggests that excessive psychological stress could be one of them. Pathophysiologic elements are only vaguely identified, but could include the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, cerebellar 5HT-2A receptors and the metabolism of heat shock proteins. Whilst the clinical presentation of ICD preceded by excessive psychological stress is typical, its course is atypical with rapid onset and fast and substantial remission.",

      "abstract": "Medication adherence is increasingly being recognized as a significant issue in treating geriatric patients. A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy. Health literacy has emerged as an important factor that affects older persons' capacity, for example, to make health care choices.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic factors pertinent to medication adherence include whether patients have insurance or other financial resources to pay for the medication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients' relationship with their physician as well as the physician's communication style can affect adherence.5\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the older adult with memory problems, we have found that whether patients depend on themselves or a caregiver can have a significant impact on adherence.6 Not all caregivers take responsibility for a patient's medication, and family members' beliefs about a medication can also affect the patient's adherence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation of elders' medication adherence as a factor in treatment success or failure is thus potentially complex, difficult, and time consuming.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality, including sexual functioning, is an important part of health and well-being. Sexual dysfunction is the persistent impairment in a domain of sexual function (desire, arousal, or orgasm) or sexual pain that is associated with significant personal distress. The relationship between infertility and sexual dysfunction is not well understood, though evidence suggests that this relationship is likely bidirectional and individuals with infertility have higher rates of disruptions in sexual functioning. The etiology of male and female sexual dysfunction is most commonly multifactorial and treatment for sexual dysfunction typically requires an interdisciplinary approach. Routine screening for sexual dysfunction is recommended. Infertility mental health professionals are well-suited to screen for sexual dysfunction, and therapeutic interventions for the management of sexual dysfunction exist. Commonly used existing approaches that are summarized here include cognitive–behavioral therapy, sensate focus sex therapy, mindfulness-based behavior therapy or mindfulness-based cognitive–behavioral therapy, and directed masturbation training.",

      "abstract": "Symptom Control at the End of Life Abstract. Patients with advanced disease suffer from multiple physical and psychological symptoms. These include pain, weakness, lack of energy, weight loss, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression. In the dying phase, death rattle, delirium and terminal agitation may be additional problems. Palliative care focusses on alleviating these symptoms, taking into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension. Main principles of symptom control in palliative care are 1) considering differential diagnoses of the causes of the symptom to be able to treat potentially reversible causes, 2) using preventive measures and 3) symptomatic treatment - on its own or in combination with causal therapy. The following should be noted regarding pharmacological treatment: In case of permanent symptoms, the drugs have to be given at fixed times, in accordance with their duration of action, to achieve a constant blood level. In addition to this regular drug administration, prn medication should be prescribed, e. g., for pain, breathlessness, and nausea. If oral administration is not possible, drugs can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or transdermally via patches. Non-pharmacological measures can be used additionally or primarily for symptom control. This paper presents important aspects of symptom control for pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression as well as for symptoms in the dying phase. It concludes by adding a few words on sedation in palliative care as a measure of last resort.Zusammenfassung. Patient_innen in fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadien leiden unter vielfältigen physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Dazu gehören Schmerzen, Schwäche, Energielosigkeit, Gewichtsverlust, Atemnot, Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Verstopfung und Depression. In der Sterbephase können Rasselatmung, Delir und / oder terminale Unruhe hinzukommen. Der Fokus palliativmedizinischer Behandlung liegt auf der Linderung dieser belastenden Symptome unter Berücksichtigung der körperlichen, psychischen, sozialen und spirituellen Dimension. Zu den Grundsätzen der palliativmedizinischen Symptomkontrolle gehören 1) eine angemessene differentialdiagnostische Ursachenklärung des Symptoms zur Behandlung potenziell reversibler Ursachen, 2) der Einsatz von präventiven Massnahmen und 3) die Durchführung einer symptomatischen Therapie – allein oder parallel zu einer ursächlichen Therapie. Bezüglich der medikamentösen Therapiemassnahmen ist Folgendes zu beachten: Bei dauerhaft vorhandenen Symptomen müssen die Medikamente entsprechend ihrer Wirkdauer nach einem festen Zeitschema gegeben werden, um einen möglichst konstanten Wirkspiegel zu erreichen. Zusätzlich zu einer solchen Dauermedikation ist zum Beispiel für Schmerzen, Atemnot und Übelkeit Bedarfsmedikation zu verschreiben. Wenn die orale Gabe nicht möglich ist, können Medikamente intravenös, subkutan oder transdermal mittels Pflaster verabreicht werden. Nichtmedikamentöse Massnahmen können ergänzend oder auch primär zur Symptomlinderung eingesetzt werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt wichtige Aspekte der Symptomkontrolle bei Schmerzen, Atemnot, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Obstipation, Depression sowie bei Symptomen in der Sterbephase vor und schliesst mit wenigen Worten zum Thema «Sedierung in der Palliativversorgung» als Ultima-Ratio-Massnahme.",

While a diagnosis of neurogenic stammering might be made in early childhood and adolescence, both neurogenic and psychogenic types are typically associated with an adult onset. DS is by far the most common form of stammering and usually develops in the pre-school years. The mean age at onset is 42, with 75% of cases beginning before the age of 6.1 However, occasionally, stammering onset may be seen as late as 12 or 13 years of age.\n\nA feature of DS is that complete recovery, either with or without therapy, is common before adolescence. Approximately 74% of all children diagnosed with stammering will cease to stammer by the time they reach their early teens, although the figure may be as high as 89% in young females.7 8 This latter statistic is consistent with the fact that while equal numbers of males and females are initially diagnosed with stammering, the sex ratio changes to around 4:1 (male:female) in the overall population. The poorest prognosis is for males who experience a later onset to their …",

The present factor analytic study examines 35 distinct depressive symptoms in three depressed samples and supports the conceptualization of D. F. Klein (Endomorphic depression. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 31: 447–454, 1974) that endogeneity and reactivity can be construed as orthogonal, independent dimensions. Symptoms consistently loading on an endogeneity factor are: 1) lacking in reactivity to environmental changes; 2) showing no interest in life; 3) retarded (slow, feeling tired, etc.); 4) feeling unable to act; 5) considering self lazy; 6) feeling helpless and powerless; and 7) perceiving depression as qualitatively different from ordinary sadness. Symptoms consistently loading on a reactivity factor are: 1) feeling that he or she is bearing troubles; 2) presence of precipitating stress; 3) crediting problems to excessive family and/or job responsibilities; 4) expressing concern for welfare of family and friends; 5) visceral symptoms; 6) feeling at \"end of rope\"; 7) having middle-of-the-night insomnia; and 8) showing self-pity. The results suggest a methodology for identifying depressives who are high-high, low-high, high-low, and low-low on the endogeneity and reactivity factors.",

We propose a seven-tiered model of service delivery based on severity and prevalence of BPSD, ranging from no dementia through tiers of increasingly severe behavioural disturbance to the propensity for extreme violence in a small number of individuals. Each tier is associated with a different model of intervention. People with dementia may move up or down between tiers depending on their condition, their care and the intervention provided. Lower-level interventions may prevent the need for the more intensive interventions needed when disturbance becomes more severe.",

A conceptual model for sexual problems in MS characterizes three levels. Primary SD includes impaired libido, lubrication, and orgasm. Secondary SD is composed of limiting sexual expressions due to physical manifestations. Tertiary SD results from psychological, emotional, social, and cultural aspects. Sexual problems cause distress and may affect the family bond. Practical suggestions on initiation of discussion of sexual issues for MS patients are included in this review. Assessment and treatment of sexual problems should combine medical and psychosexual approaches and begin early after MS diagnosis. Intervention can be done by recognizing sexual needs, educating and providing information, by letting patients express their difficulties and referring them to specialists and other information resources.",

      "abstract": "Sexual function and to a lesser extent reproduction are often disrupted in women with spinal cord injuries (SCI), who must be educated to better understand their sexual and reproductive health. Women with SCI are sexually active; they can use psychogenic or reflexogenic stimulation to obtain sexual pleasure and orgasm. Treatment should consider a holistic approach using autonomic standards to describe remaining sexual function and to assess both genital function and psychosocial factors. Assessment of genital function should include thoracolumbar dermatomes, vulvar sensitivity (touch, pressure, vibration), and sacral reflexes. Self-exploration should include not only clitoral stimulation, but also stimulation of the vagina (G spot), cervix, and nipples conveyed by different innervation sources. Treatments may consider PDE5 inhibitors and flibanserin on an individual basis, and secondary consequences of SCI should address concerns with spasticity, pain, incontinence, and side effects of medications. Psychosocial issues must be addressed as possible contributors to sexual dysfunctions (eg, lower self-esteem, past sexual history, depression, dating habits). Pregnancy is possible for women with SCI; younger age at the time of injury and at the time of pregnancy being significant predictors of successful pregnancy, along with marital status, motor score, mobility, and occupational scores. Pregnancy may decrease the level of functioning (eg, self-care, ambulation, upper-extremity tasks), may involve complications (eg, decubitus ulcers, weight gain, urological complications), and must be monitored for postural hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia. Taking into consideration the physical and psychosocial determinants of sexuality and childbearing allows women with SCI to achieve positive sexual and reproductive health.",

It is a specific form of personality disorder that comprises a broad range of symptoms. The general course is characterized by onset in childhood and persistence into late adulthood. It can be diagnosed according to criteria in standard nosologies, although specialized psychometric procedures are often preferred by forensic mental health professionals. Using broad diagnostic criteria, estimates of lifetime prevalence in the United States were found to range from ∼1.5 to 3.5% in the general population and 50–75% in forensic populations; estimates based on more stringent diagnostic criteria are about one‐third of these rates. Psychopathy appears to be more prevalent in males, in younger generations, and in individualistic cultures; this may be due to symptom expression being facilitated by norms that promote strong individualism or, alternatively, to bias in the existing diagnostic criteria. Psychopathy is frequently comorbid with substance use disorders and some other personality disorders. The etiology of psychopathy is unknown. No reliably effective treatment for psychopathy has been identified. Psychopathy is associated with serious crime, including violence, and is often considered in psycholegal evaluations related to risk assessment.",

Surface electromyography of the mentalis muscle demonstrated a tremor frequency of 8 Hz ([Video 2]). Quivering chin syndrome is a rare movement disorder. It may be sporadic or inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance with locus on chromosome 9(9q13-q21). These involuntary, paroxysmal, rhythmic, movements of the chin and/or lower lip may last from seconds to hours.[1] Episodes occur spontaneously or may be precipitated by stress and emotion. Usually no treatment is required.

The benefits of being fit touch every part of our lives—our overall energy level, sleep patterns, psychological and emotional well-being, and relationships. Except when you are experiencing severe or sharp joint pain and noticeable swelling, exercise should be a regular part of your day. The latest research shows that physical conditioning exercise can improve your fitness level without aggravating your RA or causing a flare of symptoms. So whether you have mild, moderate, or severe disease, exercise is an important part of your plan. However, it is important to understand that the type and intensity of exercise may need to be regulated, depending on your disease activity.",

The emergency department (ED) management of a patient with a seizure is commonly determined by the cause, type, severity, and frequency of the seizure. Status epilepticus (SE) can be nonconvulsive or convulsive. Convulsive SE is a medical emergency requiring prompt and focused treatment. A benzodiazepine is the first class of drug to be administered in treating SE. Alcohol withdrawal seizures are generalized tonic-clonic convulsions that usually occur within 48 hours after cessation of ethanol ingestion, with a peak incidence between 13 and 24 hours. It is important that the emergency physician knows the state's law regarding restriction of driving privileges for patients who have experienced a seizure.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that affects approximately 1 in 31 US children and 1 in 45 US adults; autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of neurologic diversity, symptoms, challenges, strengths, and abilities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., text revision criteria for autism spectrum disorder require deficits in three areas of communication and social interaction across multiple settings, with at least two restricted or repetitive behaviors, not explained by another condition, and causing functional impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for autism at ages 18 and 24 months in addition to routine developmental surveillance, whereas screening in adults is not recommended. Diagnosis should include a multidisciplinary team and a multidimensional assessment. Autistic individuals have a 20- to 30-year lower life expectancy than nonautistic people and experience higher rates of many chronic conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, gastrointestinal concerns, feeding disorders, and mental health disorders (eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia). Treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder focuses on minimizing core deficits, maximizing functional independence, and preventing problem behaviors. Pharmacologic therapy may be indicated for related conditions or symptoms, such as sleep disorders, seizures, mental health conditions, behavior problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Melatonin effectively reduces sleep symptoms and improves daytime behaviors with minimal adverse effects. The SPACE (sensory, predictability, acceptance, communication, empathy) framework provides specific interventions that make health care more accessible and affirming to autistic patients.",

An individual may suffer an accident such as a car crash or near-drowning while under the influence (consequences related to use in dangerous situations).

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

This article with focus on the latter, addressing in particular concerns related to adverse drug effects. Serious or life-threatening adverse reactions are very uncommon in people started on AEDs, although some (e.g., teratogenic effects) can be a major concern in specific patient groups. Nonserious adverse reactions leading to withdrawal of treatment are relatively common, although in most cases these are reversible following removal of the offending agent. Adverse effects associated with prolonged treatment and not leading to drug withdrawal are an important concern, because such effects are often under-recognized and may affect significantly quality of life. Additional risks relate to the occurrence of drug-drug interactions. In all cases, risks can be minimized by careful selection of the AED to be used (with particular consideration of individual characteristics which contraindicate a specific AED, or predispose to specific adverse effects), gradual dose titration, choice of an appropriate target dose and, most important of all, careful monitoring of clinical response.",

Unlike other types of schizophrenia (hebephrenic, paranoid, and catatonic), simple schizophrenia is difficult to determine the diagnosis. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V cleared the diagnosis for simple schizophrenia, but in the Mental Disorder Diagnostic Classification Guidelines (MDDCG) III and International and Classification Diseases (ICD) -10 are included. This case study discusses patients diagnosed with simple schizophrenia with a comparative diagnosis of severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms. A man named AY, aged 28 years, and did not finish primary school has no father figure. He has worked fairly and liked the woman. The decline of psychological function then occurs. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia in AY are very prominent, ie, little speech, flat affects, withdrawal from social intercourse, lack of interest and ambition, and low vitality drive. AY has ideas or thoughts that he is guilty, sinful, and looks at something so dirty that there is repetitive washing behavior. The integration result of psychological tests shows pathological signs, such as depression, anxiety, and affective disorders. The psychological dynamics of AY shows some traumatic experiences in childhood that are repressed. Conflict that develops with the mother so as to produce a complex between alien ego with ego.

The median time to full remission \nis 16.8 weeks for a manic episode but 40 weeks for a depressive \nepisode. In addition to being longer and more persistent, the \ndepressive phase of bipolar disorder is associated with higher \nrates of morbidity and mortality. The relative risk of suicide \namong patients with bipolar depression is 34.9 times greater than \nthat among patients with pure mania. Despite the clear clinical \nimplications of these findings, treatment of bipolar depression \nremains an understudied area, as clinicians and researchers have \nhistorically focused on treatment of mania. Although a wide \nrange of mood-stabilizing medications is available, treatment \noptions for bipolar depression remain more limited. The 2002 \ntreatment guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association \nrecommended either lithium or lamotrigine as first-line treatment. \nAlthough reviews of clinical trials have concluded that there is \nevidence of lithium’s acute efficacy for bipolar depression, \nanticonvulsants such as lamotrigine and valproate have also been \nused to treat bipolar depression. However, lamotrigine requires a \nslow upward titration to avoid the risk of rash. Other treatments \ninclude the adjunctive use of antidepressants with a mood \nstabilizer. However, antidepressants, may cause problems due to \ntheir potential to induce mania or hypomania or to accelerate \ncycling. \nThis paper reviews controlled studies of bipolar depression, \noutlines criteria for choosing treatment, and provides options for \ntreatment of refractory bipolar depression. The author conducted \na comprehensive review of English-language literature describing \npeer- reviewed and quality class A controlled trials in order to \nidentify agents used for bipolar disorder. Controlled studies to \nexamine the efficacy of treatments for acute bipolar depression \nwere located through electronic searches of several databases and \nby manual cross search of references and proceedings of \ninternational meetings. Lithium: There are no double-blind, \nparallel-design, placebo-controlled studies that have examined \nthe efficacy of lithium monotherapy in comparison with placebo \nin acute bipolar depression. However, the efficacy of lithium was \nexamined in three placebo-controlled cross-over studies and all \nof them showed lithium’s superiority over placebo. Available \ndata supports the efficacy of lithium in acute bipolar depression. \nValproate: A recent placebo-controlled, parallel-design study, \nexamined the efficacy of valproate monotherapy. Intent-to-treat \nanalysis indicated that 43 % of the subjects randomized to \nvalproate and 27 % randomized to placebo met criteria for \nrecovery (p= .04), but mean change from baseline in HAM-D \nscores were similar at the end-point to the placebo group. The \nnegative findings in this study could be due to a smaller sample \nsize, so this suggests the efficacy of valproate in acute bipolar \ndepression but this needs to be verified in further larger- scale \ndouble- blind trials. Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine has some \nefficacy, but further studies are needed before firm conclusions \ncan be drown. Lamotrigine: In the largest double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel study of bipolar depression to date, the \nlamotrigine 200 mg/day group showed a significantly greater \nimprovement compared with the placebo group on the \nMontgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the \nClinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. In another \n10-weekdouble-blind trial in bipolar I and bipolar II depressed \npatients, above all, no significant differences were noted using \nlast observation carried forward (LOCF). However, a subgroup \nanalysis revealed significant differences favoring lamotrigine in \nbipolar I but not in bipolar II depressed patients. The efficacy of \nlamotrigine in preventing depressive episodes in bipolar I disorder \nwas examined in two recent double-blind placebo-controlled \nstudies. In one of the studies, patients with bipolar I disorder \nwho were currently or recently in a manic or hypomanic phase \nwere treated with lamotrigine monotherapy or add on therapy to \nother psychotropic medications. Survival analysis showed that \nlamotrigine was significantly superior to placebo in time, for any \nmood episode or depressive episode. In the other study, bipolar I \ndepressed patients were treated in an open-label design with \nlamotrigine monotherapy or add on therapy and those meeting \nthe stabilization criteria were randomized to double-blind \ntreatment with one of three fixed doses of lamotrigine \nmonotherapy, lithium monotherapy or placebo for 18 months. \nResults using survival analysis indicated that lamotrigine was \nsignificantly superior to placebo in delaying time of intervention \nfor any mood episode or a depressive episode. The results of these \ntwo double-blind trials clearly indicate that lamotrigine is effective \nin delaying depressive relapses and recurrences in bipolar I patients. \nThere is no evidence to indicate that lamotrigine induces rapid \ncycling in bipolar patients. Gabapentine: The efficacy of gabapentine \nmonotherapy in comparison with lamotrigine or placebo was \nexamined over a 6-week period in patients with refractory mood \ndisorders. The results of this study indicate that lamotrigine is \neffective in 45 % of the patients, and gabapentine is no more \neffective than placebo in treating depressive symptoms. Topiramate: \nNo double-blind studies have been reported on the efficacy of \ntopiramate monotherapy in bipolar depression. Antidepressants: In \ndouble-blind active comparator studies, response rates to \nimipramina were comparable with the response rates to fluoxetine \nthrough significantly lower when compared with tranylcypromine. \nAtypical antipsychotics: Olanzapine is the only atypical antipsychotic \nthat has been tested for its efficacy in a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial in bipolar depression. Response rates were 48.2 % \nin the olanzapine group, 64.8 % in the olanzapine plus fluoxetine \ngroup, and 36.1 % in the placebo group. The results of this study \nindicate olanzapine’s monotherapy efficacy in treating acute bipolar \ndepression. \nConclusions: The literature reviewed above indicates that lithium \nis the only efficient medication in acute bipolar depression and in \npreventing depressive episodes, and that it has no propensity to \ninduce a manic switch or rapid cycling; also, it should be the firstline treatment for bipolar depression. Lamotrigine is also efficient \nin acute bipolar depression, and in preventing depressive episodes, \nbut its efficacy in preventing manic episodes has not been proven. \nThe magnitude of the antidepressant effect of olanzapine appears \nto be somewhat smaller than other established antidepressant \nmedications as well as lamotrigine. The other anticonvulsants, \nantidepressants, or atypical antipsychotics cannot be recommended \nas first-line treatments for bipolar depression.",

The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all. Nevertheless the scrupulous remain. It is in the West among Latins that scrupulosity is found in its endemic state, whereas it is unknown among Eastern Catholics and Orthodox . . .’",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

      "title": "Status epilepticus associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis in children",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen that leads to respiratory tract infections in children, often causing immune-related injuries in multiple other organs and tissues. The involvement of central nervous system has been reported in 5% to 7% of patients with M. pneumoniae infection.[1] The clinical manifestations of M. pneumoniae encephalitis are highly heterogeneous, and more than half of patients experience seizures during the acute phase, with status epilepticus occurring in severe cases.[2] Status epilepticus is a common yet critical illness of the nervous system in children. Although the frequency of M. pneumoniae encephalitis is well recognized, reports regarding this entity in children with status epilepticus are rare. Some scholars have proposed a three-level classification system in which M. pneumoniae encephalitis is diagnosed as follows[3]: (1) highly suspected – positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, with or without positive serological test results, or positive pharyngeal swab culture/PCR results with positive serological test results; (2) suspected – serology positive with negative pharyngeal swab, CSF, and PCR results, or positive pharyngeal swab/PCR results with negative serological test results, and no other infections pathogens; and (3) not excluded – positive serological test results with negative pharyngeal swab, CSF, and PCR results, with at least one confirmed infectious pathogen. This study directly tested M. pneumoniae in the CSF of children with M. pneumoniae encephalitis complicated by status epilepticus, to obtain direct evidence of this infectious agent in the central nervous system. In four cases, satisfactory results were observed following early identification and treatment of M. pneumoniae. All patients were diagnosed and treated early, thus, resulting in good prognosis. This study recruited children who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, from July 2017 to June 2018 and met the diagnostic criteria for acute encephalitis with status epilepticus. In all included patients, the RNA results for M. pneumoniae were positive, whereas the results for viruses, bacteria, and fungi were negative. We retrospectively analyzed clinical characteristics, examination results, treatment strategies, and prognosis of these four children with M. pneumoniae encephalitis complicated by status epilepticus. Clinical manifestation: It included four children, three boys and one girl, aged 3, 4, 5, and 8 years, respectively. Acute onset was observed in all the four cases. The duration of hospitalization at our institution was 14, 4, 7, and 6 days for each patient, respectively. Initial symptoms included fever with a peak temperature of 39°C to 40°C (two to four times per day, irregular). Respiratory symptoms (eg, cough) were noted in two patients, whereas disturbance of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 11–12) was noted in three patients. The remaining patient was unconscious. The type of status epilepticus differed among the four cases. One patient presented with myoclonus secondary to tonic-clonic seizures, one with generalized tonic clonus, one with complex partial seizures, and one with generalized tonic clonus combined with subclinical electronic discharges. Neck rigidity was observed in one patient, whereas the remaining three exhibited no pathogenic neurological signs. Examination results: Lumbar puncture was performed on the 4th, 6th, 7th, and 14th days after disease onset in each patient. The results of routine and biochemical CSF examinations were within the normal range, and no viral antibodies were detected in the CSF. Bacterial culture, acid fast staining, and ink staining results were negative. However, the CSF was positive for M. pneumoniae RNA. Video electroencephalography (EEG) revealed a slow-wave background rhythm of 1.5 to 3.0 Hz in each patient. Slow waves were observed in each hemisphere, and the left and right hemispheres were basically symmetrical. The interictal interval contained multifocal epileptiform discharges. Electrical status was observed in one patient. Three patients exhibited abnormal cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Among these three patients, two exhibited long T1 and T2 signals in the hippocampus, whereas one exhibited demyelination of the paraventricular white matter. No definite abnormalities were observed in the remaining case. Therapeutic response and prognosis: All four patients were treated with azithromycin for 2 weeks (5 days per week). In addition, three of the four patients were treated with dexamethasone, two with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and one with combined IVIG and glucocorticoids. Following treatment, body temperature returned to normal in all the four children. Three children experienced recovery of consciousness. Two children were free of epileptic seizures after treatment, whereas the remaining two took oral levetiracetam and topiramate to reduce seizure frequency. Although slow-wave background activity was observed on follow-up EEGs in all the four children, background activity had improved overall and epileptiform discharge had decreased significantly. In all the four cases, cranial MRI revealed varying degrees of brain atrophy. Treatment and recovery data are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Treatment strategies and prognosis of four patients with status epilepticus associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis.M. pneumoniae encephalitis is accompanied by epileptic seizures in 41% to 48% of cases, with status epilepticus accounting for approximately 50% of all epileptic seizures.[4,5] In this study, three children exhibited status epilepticus, whereas electrical status was observed in the remaining patient. It has been reported that the rate of abnormal EEG findings is relatively high in patients with M. pneumoniae encephalitis,[6] mainly manifesting as diffuse slow waves and epileptic discharge. In this study, all the four children with status epilepticus exhibited abnormal EEG findings (ie, diffuse slow waves). Three of these children exhibited epileptiform discharges in multiple brain regions, whereas one exhibited sustained spikes and slow waves in the bilateral frontal regions. EEG abnormalities were severe in all the four cases, indicating that brain damage may be more severe in the acute phase of M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus. However, due to a disease in progression and timely treatment, EEG findings improved to varying degrees in our patients. Although the slow-wave background activity remained, epileptiform discharge decreased significantly and status epilepticus did not recur. The prognosis of M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus is relatively good, and it is fairly easy to control status epilepticus. The common pathological changes associated with M. pneumoniae encephalitis include demyelination of white matter, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular edema, and glial cell proliferation. Imaging findings in patients with M. pneumoniae encephalitis can be normal, but may also reveal focal changes, diffuse edema, or abnormal intensity in the gray/white matter.[7] Some studies have indicated that high signal intensity in the striatum and midbrain can be observed on magnetic resonance images obtained from patients with M. pneumoniae encephalitis, and that images obtained from patients with myelitis show abnormal signals in the spinal cord.[8] In our study, three patients with M. pneumoniae encephalitis complicated by status epilepticus exhibited abnormal cranial MRI findings. One patient exhibited demyelinating changes in the paraventricular white matter, one patient exhibited abnormal signals in the bilateral hippocampus, and one patient exhibited abnormal signals in the left hippocampus. These findings indicated that the rate of MRI abnormalities was high in children with M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus, but that lesion location was nonspecific in such cases, which was similar to findings observed in patients with severe encephalitis.[9] Varying degrees of brain atrophy on cranial magnetic resonance images during convalescence might indicate that M. pneumoniae severely damaged the brain parenchyma, thereby damaging nerve cells and affecting their function. M. pneumoniae infection could lead to immune damage. Increases in M. pneumoniae antibody levels could be detected in the blood, and immunotherapy could improve the symptoms of M. pneumoniae infection.[10] In this study, IVIG was used in two cases, whereas dexamethasone was used in three cases, yielding good results in all cases. These findings suggested that although M. pneumoniae infection was the main mechanism in the early stage of the disease, immune responses might also play a role. Thus, early treatment strategies should utilize macrolides in conjunction with immunotherapy. The prognosis of M. pneumoniae encephalitis is poor and that the mortality rate is high. It has been indicated that surviving children experienced neurological sequelae and were highly unlikely to recover to baseline levels.[11] A previous study collected follow-up data for 2011 children with epileptic seizures after M. pneumoniae encephalitis for 6 to 131 months.[11] Among the 99 enrolled patients with M. pneumoniae-related encephalitis, 47 (47.5%) developed post-encephalitic epilepsy. Nineteen of these children (40.4%) with post-encephalitic epilepsy experienced intractable seizures. In this study, our four patients were treated with azithromycin and immunotherapy immediately after the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae encephalitis. Symptoms were controlled after 1 to 2 weeks of treatment, and no status epilepticus or refractory status epilepticus occurred. Furthermore, the rate of epileptic seizures decreased significantly after treatment with oral antiepileptic drugs and no children exhibited cognitive impairment. Although our findings suggested that early diagnosis and treatment of M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus resulted in relatively good prognosis, further studies that include more thorough neuropsychological testing at follow-up are required to verify this hypothesis. In conclusion, M. pneumoniae encephalitis with status epilepticus occurs in relatively younger patients (ie, mainly in children with preschool age), who tend to exhibit abnormal MRI findings. Children with severe neurological diseases, such as status epilepticus, should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible to control symptoms and improve prognosis.

      "abstract": "This article provides a brief overview of Early Onset Schizophrenia (EOS). Schizophrenia is a severe, devastating and common psychiatric disorder (around 1% of general population). EOS is defined as onset before 18 years with a Childhood Onset Schizophrenia (COS) sub-category beginning before 13. COS is rare representing 1% of all schizophrenia, with a prevalence of 1 in 10000 births. Prevalence increases remarkably during adolescence with 4% of all schizophrenic disorders before 10 and 12-34% before 18. DSM-IV criteria for EOS are the same as for adult onset schizophrenia. Interestingly, compared to cases with adult onset, EOS shows the following characteristics: 1) it is more frequent in males; 2) onset is more often insidious; 3) minor neurological signs, negative symptoms and catatonia are more frequent; 3) a history of developmental problems (ranging from minor motor coordination disorder to autism spectrum disorders) occurs in up to 50% of the cases; 4) the disease process has a greater impact on cognition and brain anatomic markers; 5) comorbid organic and genetic risk factors, including mental retardation, are more prevalent. Gold standard treatments are antipsychotic medications, which are approved by administration until 13 years old in France. It is of particular importance to search for side effects which may have different profile in pediatric populations.",

For conceptual clarity, it is helpful to consider that there are different ways in which emotional factors can exert an influence on the course of any illness. Several of these factors are briefly described as follows: 1. Occasionally the emotional state or set of attitudes of the patient may be reflected in his inability or unwillingness to cooperate with the therapeutic regimen prescribed for him. This difficulty may be encountered, of course, in every degree of severity ranging from mildly annoying uncooperativeness to defiance of medical advice with tragic consequences.

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders, and affects about 50 million people around the world. It is a heterogeneous condition characterized by recurrent spontaneous epileptic seizures. There are no age, sex or race discriminations, although incidence of the first epileptic seizure has a bimodal distribution, with peaks in childhood and after 60 years of age (Engel & Pedley, 2008). According to their localization, epilepsies and epileptic seizures should be classified as focal (or partial) and generalized. Partial seizures begin in a restricted portion of cerebral cortex. Partial seizures are associated with a restricted area of the of the cerebral cortex and are clasified as either simple or complex, depending on the level of conscious awareness. Simple partial seizures are characterized by brief specific neurologic dysfunction, contingent upon the localization of the epileptogenic focus. By definition, they do not compromise consciousness during the event, and might manifest as motor signs (with a focus involving the primary motor area), sensitive symptoms (focus in the primary somatosensory area), autonomic or psychic signs (mesiobasal areas). Complex partial seizures affect the patient’s consciousness from the onset of the event. Both simple and complex partial seizures can propagate to the whole brain and become secondarily generalized seizures. Examples of primary generalized seizures are absence seizures, tonic-clonic generalized seizures, and myoclonic seizures. All those three seizure types are generated by epileptic discharges involving both cerebral hemispheres from their onset. By extension, focal epilepsies are characterized by recurrent spontaneous partial seizures, and generalized epilepsies have generalized seizures as their main seizure type. Epilepsies can be idiopathic (without an identifiable structural cause), symptomatic (due to a structural lesion), or cryptogenic (with a presumed lesion, not detectable by current available neuroimaging methods). Broadly, idiopathic epilepsies (partial or generalized) begin in the childhood years, have a good prognosis, and go into remission during adolescence. The symptomatic generalized epilepsies encompass a group of epileptic syndromes with very poor prognosis, characterized by extremely refractory seizures and accompanied by neurodevelopmental delay. The symptomatic partial epilepsies depict a large spectrum of epileptic disorders caused by several types of brain lesions. A significant percentage of patients who have seizures not responsive to antiepileptic drugs is affected by this type of epilepsy. Surgical treatment becomes a good therapeutic option for these patients, and the identification of the structural cortical lesion causing their epilepsies is primordial for a good postsurgical prognosis (Panaiyotopoulos, 2010).",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "abstract": "Psychological traumas may occur during childhood in the form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional neglect. Trauma may be experienced when a person experiences serious loss or his/her life is under grave threat. If such traumatic event is neither dealt effectively nor resolved completely, it may predispose such a person to development of mental health issues such as drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS). Persons who experience or suffer from childhood psychological trauma tend to consume alcohol in order to cope with their trauma related experiences. Hence, generally, onset of alcohol dependence is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Childhood psychological trauma especially emotional abuse acts as a risk factor for the development of alexithymia in later life among persons with alcohol dependence. Alexithymia is a state of emotional dysregulation, which is characterized by the triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in distinguishing between the physical sensation and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others, which is known as externally oriented style of thinking. Alexithymia is itself a risk factor for the development of ADS. Thus, both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia play a significant role in the development of ADS. Findings of the present study showed that childhood psychological trauma(s), alexithymia, and ADS are interconnected. The present study findings conclude that significant relationship exists between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "abstract": "Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder (16.6%) and is frequently associated with impairments in several areas. Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a prevalent problem with rates ranging from 40-45% in adult women and 20- 30% in adult men. A relationship between depression and sexual dysfunction has been shown in the literature although the mechanisms of this association are not yet clear. Many antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), list sexual dysfunction as a side effect. New drug alternatives with fewer side effects have been proposed, and bupropion is one of them. This study aims to review the literature on bupropion and its impact in sexual function on depressed subjects. Most of the studies have noted that bupropion is not only as effective as other antidepressants but has the advantage of a lower impact on sexual functioning. Some other studies have found that bupropion can even enhance sexual function in certain individuals. Bupropion is also effective, when combined with other antidepressants, in treating emergent sexual dysfunction. Bupropion may be an alternative treatment for depression that does not include the sexual side effects associated with most of the prescribed antidepressants available; however, additional research is required.",

The patient experienced visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations during which time his consciousness, attention, orientation and higher cognitive functions remained intact. Somatic and neuroimaging investigations showed no abnormalities. The patient partially recovered on treatment with haloperidol.If hallucinations are experienced during or after a period of alcohol abuse, the diagnosis of alcohol hallucinosis should be considered.

They can be all named posttraumatic neuropathies: painless sensations in phantom limb ,painful phantom limb and painful posttraumatic stump. Painless sensations in phantom limb can be seen in 90% of cases in resected body parts as soon as first postoperative day, less often during the first week, and its clinical characteristics are usually stabilized during the first year. Painful posttraumatic stump appears because of pain neuroma existing, that forms at the proximal end of amputational stump as a consequence of physiological nerve regeneration attempt. Frequency of pain significantly varies considering authors from 5 - 90%, depending on definition of this phenomena and criteria used. It is considered that 5- 10% mast be under permanent medicament treatment. Phantom pain appears more often in elderly and people with specific affective personality construction. It can bee permanent, burning, nettling, tearing (25%), or intermittent, lancerating, in the shape of electrical discharging (32%), but it can also have bizarre attributes. Phantom pain appearance usually announces its duration in the longer period. After two years it is present at 59% of patients, with decreasing intensity, and only 5- 10% suffer severe pain. In our Institute in the period from 1980-2003, 48 patients have been treated, 36 patients with medicamentous treatment, local blockades and chronic stimulations, and 12 patients, who did not react at conservative treatment were operated.

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

The duration of each cycle varies from 2 days to 18 months but is usually constant in a given subject and bears no relationship to external factors. Presumably they have their origin within the body, and a disturbance of endocrine function has been suggested in many cases. Some women show cycles corresponding to the menstrual rhythm, the abnormal phase preceding or accompanying the menstrual flow.",

Erectile dsfunction and coronary hear t disease (CHD) share the same risk factors. They may develop independently but often develop together. The ability to have an erection is integral to a man's perception of his wel -being. Evidence suggests that only a small proportion of people will ask for help. This highlights the importance of feeling comfortable enough to raise and discuss sexual matters. Erectile dysfunction in patients with CHD may have psychological origins owing to a fear of serious cardiac incident, but may also have physiological causes owing to a disease process/arterial damage, or it may be a combination of both. In most cases there will be a variety of treatment options which are available.",

Delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech that have a sudden onset and return to normal within a month are indicative of a brief psychotic disorder. Schizophreniform disorder is an intermediate diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and schizophrenia. Another important distinction separates schizophreniform disorder from a diagnosis of schizophrenia—level of impairment. Symptoms of schizophrenia are the same as for schizophreniform disorder, except for the duration criteria, which must last at least 6 months. Schizoaffective disorder is one of the least understood disorders in DSM-5 . It includes symptoms of a mood disorder along with symptoms of a cognitive disorder, with the duration and severity of each being crucial for diagnosis.",

MS will usually present with either a history of acute relapse(s) or with progressive neurological impairment#### Key points\n\nThe most common presentation of MS is following a relapse. The peak age of the first episode is in the third decade; however, patients often present to the neurologist later with their second or third relapse or less commonly in the secondary progressive phase of illness.

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "Alcohol use, Abuse, Depression and Anxiety : The Clinical Links",
      "abstract": "Alcohol dependence, anxiety disorders and major depression commonly occur together; however, few stud- ies have assessed prospectively the magnitude of the risk that one disorder imparts on the subsequent oc- currence of the other. The following articles looks at certain important clinical factors in this association while trying to point out the reasons for the linkage between these disorders and how their treatments and management are interdependent. It also looks at comorbidity studies and outcome factors based on management. INTRODUCTION The recent large-scale epidemiologic study of psychopathol- ogy in the United States indicates that, while nearly half of the population will experience a major psychiatric illness at some point over their lifetime, the majority of these individu- als will also meet diagnostic criteria for at least one addi- tional disorder. In addition to its high frequency, psychiatric comorbidity has been shown to have important implications for patient functioning and prognosis. Comorbid conditions typically follow a more chronic and severe course than single disorders, and they are less amenable to treatment. Individu- als with two or more diagnoses are also significantly more likely to experience severe impairment in important life do- mains such as social and occupational functioning. For these reasons, it is not surprising that comorbidity has been re- ferred to as one of the most important challenges in the field of mental health. Understanding the nature of these relation- ships may have important implications for improving nosol- ogy, as well as for developing better models of prevention and treatment. Although many psychiatric disorders co-occur with great frequency, few conditions have been more widely or consistently implicated in comorbid relationships than alcoholism. Alcoholism is perhaps most strongly associated with antisocial personality disorder and drug abuse, but its relationship to other forms of psychopathology has become increasingly evident. In particular, investigations of patient samples indicate a strong co-occurrence of alcoholism with diverse forms of anxiety and depressive disorders. Results from community surveys and epidemiologic samples indicate that substantial comorbidity also exists for these disorders in the general population. These latter findings are particu- larly meaningful considering that alcoholism, anxiety, and depressive disorders are also the most common psychiatric syndromes in community surveys. The high co-occurrence of these syndromes, therefore, represents a significant clinical and public health issue that is likely to affect a substantial proportion of the general population.",

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen.

The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

      "abstract": "Epileptic seizure is symptom of acute diseases (provoked seizure with known cause) or epilepsy (unprovoked epileptic seizure with no irritated factor). For establishment of seizure type a precise anamnesis is necessary and an EEG (video-polygraphy when awake, during sleep, after deprivation, with photostimulation, hyperventilation). Normal EEG, as well as an abnormal EEG with a positive family history of epilepsy does not confirm epileptic seizure. With clinical evaluation of the first unprovoked or repeated epileptic seizure, the exact classification of seizure, epilepsy or syndrome will be established. A non-provoked epileptic seizure will be repeated in 14-65% children in one year. In children with idiopathic/cryptogenic seizures the risk for repetition is 30-50% and in children with symptomatic cause the risk is higher than 50% in a 2 year period from the unprovoked seizure. About 46% of children followed-up over 10yrs had one or more epileptic seizures after the first unprovoked seizure. According to the literature data, even prolonged seizures rarely cause brain damage in children, except in connection with acute neurological disturbances. One of the reasons for starting antiepileptic therapy (AET) is the fear of injury or death during the next seizure. To lessen the cause of injury, it is necessary to reduce all possible risks during the daytime. Sudden death in children with epilepsy is a rarity and is connected to some kind of neurological damage. There is no study with a description of a lesser risk of injury or sudden death in children with AET introduced after the first unprovoked seizure. According to two studies of class II and four studies of class III according to EB criteria, there is no difference in terms of the chance of repeated seizure in children with AET and those without AET. The decision about introducing AET or not, in children or adolescents after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure should be based on the possibility of repeated epileptic seizures and the danger of permanent AET that can influence the child’s cognitive development, behaviour, physical and psychosocial development. The decision should be evaluated individually for each child taking into account the medical reasons together with the decisions of the patients and family. Recommendations after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure: AET is not indicated for prevention of development of epilepsy (level B); 2. Treatment with AET should be considered as a possibility of preventing the next seizure and the risk of pharmacological and psychosocial side-effects (level B). At first, in a child with the first epileptic seizure, all gathered data, clinical features and findings should be considered together with a detailed clinical evaluation, instead of immediate initiation of AET treatment.",

A diagnosis of PMS requires that the symptoms be severe enough to affect a woman's ability to function at home or in the workplace or in her relationships with others. Diagnostic assessment entails a thorough medical and psychiatric history and prospective daily ratings. Disorders such as major depression, anxiety, hypothyroidism, and diabetes must be excluded before a diagnosis of PMS can be considered. Treatment strategies include either eliminating the hormonal cycle associated with ovulation or treating the symptom(s) causing the most distress to the patient. Medical therapies are available for both treatment approaches but should be initiated only after behavioral measures have failed; the physician must also carefully weigh the severity of symptoms against the potential for adverse effects of treatment.",

Der Artikel fasst den Wissensstand zu den mit Sexualität verbundenen Verhaltensstörungen zusammen. Generell erschweren das Fehlen klarer Definitionen, ätiologischer Einteilungen und diagnostischer Instrumente die Untersuchung dieser Störungen. Bedingt durch die Heterogenität der Studienpopulationen, Definitionen und Erhebungsmethoden variieren die Prävalenzraten stark (1,8 – 18 %). Ätiologisch werden Dysfunktionen in verschiedenen Hirnbereichen diskutiert. Die Störungen sind bei Männern häufiger als bei Frauen und scheinen bei vaskulären, frontotemporalen und parkinsonassoziierten Demenzen häufiger vorzukommen als bei Alzheimer Demenzen. Die publizierten medikamentösen und nicht medikamentösen Therapiestrategien sind bezüglich der Wirksamkeit unbefriedigend untersucht.",

      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia, first described as a distinct entity in 1949 (Riley et al. , 1949), is considered to be a comparatively rare disease, only some 48 cases being so far recorded (Riley et al. , 1954). But as its features become more widely known it is likely to be increasingly recognized. It occurs in children of Jewish parentage, the majority of cases being reported from the U.S.A., with one from South America (Tyndel, 1955), and some from Montreal (Riley, 1955). The constant symptoms comprise: defective lachrymation (“crying without tears”); symmetrical, blotchy erythema following emotional disturbances or eating; excessive sweating; sialorrhoea; emotional lability; poor motor coordination; relative indifference to pain; and hypo- or areflexia. Inconstant symptoms are: intermittent hypertension; periodic vomiting which may threaten life; liability to respiratory diseases; frequent unexplained bouts of pyrexia; attacks of apnoea during the first year of life; corneal ulceration; orthopaedic changes (scoliosis, pes cavus); and epileptiform convulsions (Riley, 1952). The condition is familial, apparently being inherited as a simple recessive trait (Riley et al. , 1954), though an irregular dominant is a possibility (St. Martin, 1953).",

      "title": "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Hypothalamic Amenorrhea",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

This was found to be significantly higher in women who experienced a high-risk pregnancy or birth. PTSD presents with intrusive flashbacks, avoidance of triggering circumstances, fear, irritability, guilt and shame. There is also a significant group of women who do not meet the full PTSD criteria but who still experienced the birth as traumatic. When the experience of that traumatic birth causes ongoing distress, this is referred to as 'birth trauma.' Women with birth trauma do not meet all the criteria to be diagnosed with PTSD but do display symptoms of traumatic stress similar to those found in PTSD. Both medical interventions during childbirth and women's subjective feelings of poor-quality care have been identified as contributing factors to Birth Trauma and postnatal PTSD. Birth trauma has been found to be often co-morbid with other mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and fear of birth. Sometimes, that has led to PTSD being missed as the underlying issue, and the diagnosis of PTSD has been missed or delayed.",

In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

En este estudio se describe el comportamiento de los factores farmacológicos y no farmacológicos que alteran la adherencia al tratamiento, de 85 pacientes con esquizofrenia, dados de alta de la Unidad de Salud Mental (USM), del Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo de Neiva (HUHMP), mediante revisión de la historia clínica y la entrevista telefónica del acudiente, familiar o del mismo paciente. La mayoría de los pacientes encuestados son adultos jóvenes, de género masculino, solteros, procedentes del departamento del Huila, con baja escolaridad, sin vinculo laboral en el momento del estudio. Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas. El conocer estos comportamientos, es un precedente para futuras investigaciones y además es punto de partida para crear estrategias que permitan mejorar la tasa de adherencia al tratamiento por parte de los pacientes esquizofrénicos, desde un punto de vista integral e individualizado a la vez.",

There are, however, certain interesting variations from the average law referable to involvement of the various cranial nerves other than the eighth. For example, involvement of the seventh cranial nerve usually brings about simple weakness of the muscles of expression on the side affected. In the majority of cases it is slight and indicated only by asymmetry in the lower facial muscles that is not at all conspicuous or remarkable. A rare sign of involvement of the seventh nerve is facial spasm or twitching that may appear early and dominate the whole clinical picture.",

      "title": "POST–SPINAL CORD INJURY PAIN STATES",
      "abstract": "Pain, in contrast to motor deficit, is rarely the main cause of functional disability in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). It frequently occurs, however, in conjunction with disabling motor, autonomic, and urinary tract problems. It is estimated that there are more than 200,000 patients in the United States with SCI. 38 It is probable that more than a half of all SCI patients suffer from pain. 6 These numbers reflect the overall magnitude of this problem. The severity and persistence of pain associated with SCI are, however, of greater significance than its prevalence. It is not unusual for these patients to experience pain for decades because their longevity approaches normal life expectancy owing to early interventions and rehabilitative measures. 40 The lack of effective treatment for SCI pain causes these patients great frustration because in addition to long-term motor disability, they must endure intractable pain. This article first discusses acute pains resulting from spinal injury (Table 1). The remainder of the article concentrates on chronic pains that either appear immediately or sometime after SCI and continue for more than 6 months. It is important to recognize that after 3 to 6 months, the condition of the patient's spinal cord stabilizes, and neurologic dysfunction is no longer considered chronic but rather is referred to as a permanent post-SCI neurologic condition. Pain can appear at any time after SCI (i.e., in the acute stage, during recovery, or in the stable phase). In addition, some pain syndromes are found to be related to complications of SCI. The term pain is used generically throughout the article, although it sometimes may denote more than one type of pain. Referrals to pain generally include dysesthesia because it is difficult to distinguish between these conditions before considering a detailed description of the patient's complaint, including its distribution as well as neurologic findings. 7 Nociceptive versus neurogenic pain (see the articles by Sorkin, and Yaksh and Chaplan) is presented followed by a discussion regarding central pain syndrome, which is treated separately for the purpose of this article. Cauda equina injury is a pure root/nerve injury and does not include primary spinal cord lesion. It is, however, common to include cauda equina injury in discussion of SCI pain. 15, 22, 54 This article also includes discussion about cauda equina injury for several reasons: It is caused by spinal column injury, it may occur concomitantly with conus medullaris injury, and its associated pain is similar to so-called transitional zone SCI pain.",

The frequency of antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction is greatly underestimated in clinical trials that rely on patient self-report of these adverse events. Direct inquiry reveals that delayed orgasm/ejaculation occurs in ≥50% and anorgasmia in at least one third of patients given selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction can be successfully managed. A different antidepressant without significant sexual effects, such as bupropion or mirtazapine, can often be substituted. Other strategies involve drug holidays or adjunctive therapy with drugs such as sildenafil. Dopamine antagonist antipsychotic drugs are most commonly associated with decreased libido. The newer atypical antipsychotics, with less effect on dopamine, are less commonly associated with sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction is commonly reported with seizure disorders, and many anticonvulsant drugs affect levels of sex hormones. Because sexual dysfunction can be related to many factors, care must be taken to establish the patient's baseline sexual functioning before the initiation of psychotropic drug therapy and to rule out other etiologies before drugs are implicated as causative.",

      "title": "Frailty and dependence in elderly dialysis patients",
      "abstract": "Patients older than 75 years of age currently represent more than 35% of the population that begins dialysis each year in most European registries; in our centre, at least 30 patients in this age bracket begin dialysis, which represent 45% of the total incident patients. The absence of systematic studies makes this patient category almost indistinguishable from other categories, even though its peculiarity is now becoming evident. At least 30–40% of elderly individuals are expected to be frail and/or dependent, but the incidence of frailty is likely to be higher in those undergoing haemodialysis. Due to severe physical and/or mental impairment and often because of social hardship, these patients rarely experience clinical stability and are dependent on third parties for their survival. Early symptoms of frailty consist of weakness, anorexia, weight loss, muscular atrophy, reactive depression and cognitive deficits. Commonly, early signs and symptoms are underestimated until patients become dependent as defined by the presence of several pathological conditions, such as instability, immobility, iatrogenic drug reactions, intellectual impairment, and incontinence. The last phase of the condition is that of acute complications – pathological fractures, pressure ulcers, delirium, infectious complications with multiple hospital admissions, which cause a significant reduction in patient survival. The care of these patients presents complex problems for welfare services, and has led to the re-organisation of in-patient and out-patient dialysis units. Repeated patient admissions to the hospital require a much greater use of facilities and staff compared to younger dialysis patients. Of 112 elderly patients consecutively admitted to our dialysis programme over a period of 10 years, we identified 35 dependent (defined here as the need for continual assistance) patients (31.2%). Dependence proved to be the only clinical parameter associated with survival, while co-morbidity (in particular cardiovascular disease that usually affects survival rates in younger age groups) did not seem to be discriminating risk factors in the elderly. Emerging data from larger studies will likely demonstrate that the elderly should be systematically monitored for frailty and dependence during dialysis, as is the case in exclusively geriatric fields. Many of the clinical problems of the dialysed elderly, such as sensory, mental, and functional impairment, are more the result of advanced age, pre-existent diseases, and social deprivation, rather than of uraemia and dialysis per se. Prevention, as well as a therapeutic approach specifically modelled on these conditions, could help to improve the prognosis of this patient category, which is becoming numerically predominant in dialysis units.",

      "abstract": "Overtraining is an imbalance between training and recovery, exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance. Stress is the sum of training and nontraining stress factors. Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable, LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

Diagnostic criteria require recurrent panic attacks in 1 month or one panic attack with continuous fear of other attacks. Symptoms associated with the panic attack include palpitations; sweating; feeling short of breath or a choking sensation; nausea or abdominal discomfort; feeling dizzy; having a sense of unreality; numbness or tingling; chills or hot flushes; and a fear of dying or losing control.",

      "title": "Non-essential symptoms of depression and cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) in community-dwelling elders without dysphoria or anhedonia",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Several neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in elders with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) can be part of a major depressive episode (MDE) or a “subthreshold” depressive episode. Certain neuropsychiatric symptoms of CIND are essential symptoms of MDE (e.g. dysphoria, anhedonia), while other are non-essential symptoms (NESD; e.g. fatigue, insomnia, cognitive complaint). Contrary to essential symptoms, NESD are not specific to MDE and are present in other disorders. It is unknown whether NESD are linked to CIND in absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. The present study examined the association between NESD and probable CIND in elders without essential MDE symptoms. Methods: Participants were 2028 community-dwelling individuals aged 65–96 years who had not experienced dysphoria/anhedonia during the year preceding the interview. Semi-structured in-home interviews evaluated the following NESD: alteration of appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor alteration, fatigue/loss of energy, worthlessness/guilt, and cognitive complaints. Probable CIND cases were defined based on the Mini-mental State Examination cut-offs (15th percentile) stratified for age, education and sex. Results: Symptoms of fatigue/loss of energy (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.42–4.09), sleep disturbance (OR: 3.04 CI: 1.69–5.46) and cognitive complaints (OR: 2.86 CI: 1.71–4.77) were significantly associated with CIND. These associations were not modified after adjustments for potential confounders (age, education level, sex, benzodiazepine use, chronic diseases, and brain disorders). Conclusion: A psychiatric symptomatology occurs in older adults with CIND in the absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. NESD encountered in the absence of dysphoria/anhedonia should receive particular attention by clinicians since they can be linked to cognitive difficulties.",

Depression, the most common mental disorder in later life, is a major precipitating factor in suicide. Alcoholism is another major precipitating factor in late-life suicide. Approximately one-third of all suicides are alcoholics. Many of the same factors which contribute to depression also increase the risk of alcoholism and/or suicide. Loss, stress, loneliness, low self-esteem, and feelings of anxiety, rejection, helplessness, and hopelessness characterize late life alcoholism and depression. Alcoholism, depression, and suicide form a deadly triangle. Family, caregivers, and practitioners need to be aware of the deadly relationship between alcoholism, depression, and suicide in older adults.",

      "abstract": "Conclusion:Alcohol abuse is prone to several types of crime but the most evaluated in psychiatry consultation are cases of drunk driving and domestic violence.We can conclude that alcohol offenses are mostly men alone (single or divorced), with little insight into alcohol-related problems (ARL), making psychiatric / psychological intervention difficult to reduce drinking, making ineffective / useless use of motivational interviewing.Most respondents do not cease consumption, which entails risks for themselves and others as well as recidivism in crime.There is an unequivocal association between alcohol abuse and criminality/violence. Alcohol-related problems are an important public health problem, with negative consequences on the consumer's life, since they affect various aspects of our lives, from individual and family health problems to the labor and social level.The increased tendency to aggressive behavior of these patients causes legal problems such as public order violence, domestic violence, child abuse or even homicide, as well as driving crimes.It is imperative to articulate the judicial services with the psychiatric services, in order to better evaluate patients and treat existing comorbidities that may tend to doing crimes in order to minimize them TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL ABUSE AS A PENALITY METHOD -PATIENT PROFILES AND COMMITED CRIMESObjectives: Know and explore criminal behavior and profile of individuals with addictive alcohol pathology. Material/methods:Retrospective study of the processes of the users sent by the court to the Psychiatry department of the CHMT for treatment of addictive alcohol pathology.Collection of sociodemographic data (gender, age, marital status, employment status), psychiatric comorbidities, type of crime committed, attendance at consultations and therapeutic adherence.The behavioral pattern was compared before and after follow-up, taking into account possible recidivism of crime cases. Background/aims:Alcohol consumption may lead to increased levels of anxiety, impulsivity and consequent aggression in individuals.Because of these cognitive and behavioral changes, an individual with addictive alcohol pathology may be more vulnerable to adopting thoughts and behaviors that may risk their lives or those around them, increasing the probability of committing a crime.This study socio-demographically describes the patients refereed by court to the Psychiatry dept. of C.H.M.T for treatment of alcohol addictive pathology, also investigating the relationship between alcohol abuse and crime, pathology prevalence, therapeutic adherence and abstinence.",

      "abstract": "Musical hallucinations are a kind of auditory hallucination that are prevalent among the non-psychiatric population, but which have rarely been reported in the neurological literature. They occur most frequently in the elderly, in females and when there is a loss of hearing, but their pathophysiology has still to be unravelled.We report here six cases (five females and one male) of musical hallucinations diagnosed in a general neurology clinic over a time-span of five years. In five cases there was also concurrent hypoacusis, to a greater or lesser extent, and one had been triggered by pentoxifylline. In most instances, the musical content of the hallucinations had its origins in music experienced in childhood and early youth. In the cases submitted to pharmacological treatment, the response was poor. Yet, after explaining to the patients that the condition was benign and had no connection with a psychotic pathology, the degree of acceptance of the symptoms was good.Musical hallucinations are a little-known pathology lying on the borderline between neurology, otorhinolaryngology and psychiatry which are often wrongly linked to mental disease. It is essential to explain to patients and relatives that these symptoms are not necessarily of a psychiatric nature, and to be aware of the potential capacity of some commonly used drugs to generate them.Alucinaciones musicales: la musica perpetua.Introduccion. Las alucinaciones musicales son un tipo de alucinacion auditiva prevalente en la poblacion no psiquiatrica, pero escasamente comunicada en la bibliografia neurologica. Ocurren con mayor frecuencia en la poblacion anciana, del sexo femenino y con perdida de audicion, pero su fisiopatologia esta por desentrañar. Casos clinicos. Se presentan seis casos (cinco mujeres y un hombre) de alucinaciones musicales diagnosticados en una consulta de neurologia general en un lapso de tiempo de cinco años. En cinco de ellos concurria la hipoacusia en mayor o menor grado y uno estaba desencadenado por la pentoxifilina. En su mayoria, el contenido musical de las alucinaciones provenia de experiencias musicales vividas en la infancia y juventud. En los casos sometidos a tratamiento farmacologico la respuesta fue pobre; sin embargo, una vez explicada a los pacientes la benignidad del cuadro y su desvinculacion con patologia psicotica, el grado de aceptacion del sintoma fue bueno. Conclusiones. Las alucinaciones musicales son una patologia fronteriza entre la neurologia, la otorrinolaringologia y la psiquiatria poco conocida, que, con frecuencia, se vincula erroneamente a la enfermedad mental. Es fundamental explicar a pacientes y familiares el caracter no necesariamente psiquiatrico de este sintoma, asi como conocer la potencialidad que tienen algunos farmacos de uso comun para generarlo.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features; cardiovascular disease (dilation of the ascending aorta in 46%); neurologic abnormalities (hypotonia, adventitious movements, and abnormal gait and station); speech sound disorders including motor speech disorders (childhood apraxia of speech and/or dysarthria) and phonologic disorders; behavior problems including anxiety disorders (especially social anxiety disorder [social phobia]), selective mutism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional disorders, physical aggression, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD); delayed motor, speech, and social skills in early childhood; and intellectual ability ranging from intellectual disability (~18%) to borderline intellectual ability (~20%) to low average to high average (the remainder). Approximately 30% of individuals with the 7q11.23 duplication have one or more congenital anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is established by detection of a recurrent 1.5- to 1.8-Mb heterozygous duplication of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR). Management Treatment of manifestations: Aortic dilation is treated with beta blocker therapy and/or surgery as needed. Constipation should be aggressively managed at all ages to prevent encopresis and impaction. Address developmental disabilities, including ASD, through early intervention programs (including speech/language therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy), special education programs, and vocational training. Address ASD with applied behavior analytic interventions and other empirically supported psychosocial approaches. Address childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or manifestations of this disorder with intensive speech/language therapy to maximize effective oral communication and prevent or limit later language impairment and/or reading disorder. Address emotional and behavioral disorders (aggression, social anxiety, selective mutism) with cognitive-behavioral therapy, applied behavior analysis behavior modification intervention, and psychotropic medications as needed. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of head circumference in infancy. Annual monitoring of aortic diameter (including Z scores in children) and behavior. Annual assessment by occupational and physical therapists and speech and language pathologists until age six years. Genetic counseling The 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. About 27% of probands have an affected parent. When a parent has the 7q11.23 duplication, the risk to each sib of inheriting the duplication is 50%. If the 7q11.23 duplication identified in the proband is not identified in the parents, the risk to sibs is low (",

      "title": "Premenstrual symptoms.",
      "abstract": "Data is reviewed on premenstrual symptoms which have been related to high suicide and accident rates, employment absentee rates, poor academic performance and acute psychiatric problems. A recent study of healthy young women indicated that 39% had troublesome premenstrual symptoms, 54% passed clots in their menses, 70% had cyclical localized acneiform eruptions and only 17% failed to experience menstrual pain. Common menstrual disorders are classified as either dysmenorrhea or the premenstrual syndrome. Symptoms for the latter usually begin 2-12 days prior to menstruation and include nervous tension, irritability, anxiety, depression, bloated breasts and abdomen, swollen fingers and legs, headaches, dizziness, occasional hypersomia, excessive thirst and appetite. Some women may display an increased susceptibility to migraine, vasomotor rhinitis, asthma, urticaria and epilepsy. Symptoms are usually relieved with the onset of menses. While a definitive etiological theory remains to be substantiated, symptomatic relief has been reported with salt and water restriction and simple diuretics used 7 to 10 days premenstrually. Diazapam or chlordiazepoxide treatment is recommended before oral contraceptive therapy. The premenstrual syndrome may persist after menopause, is unaffected by parity, and sufferers score highly on neuroticism tests. Primary or spasmodic dysmenorrhea occurs in young women, tends to decline with age and parity and has no correlation with premenstrual symptoms or neuroticism. Spasmodic or colicky pain begins and is most severe on the first day of menstruation and may continue for 2-3 days. Treatment of dysmenorrhea with psychotropic drugs or narcotics is discouraged due to the risk of dependence and abuse. Temporary relief for disabling pain may be obtained with oral contraceptives containing synthetic estrogen and progestogen but the inherent risks should be acknowledged. Both disorders have been correlated to menstrual irregularity. Amenorrhea in many women may be precipitated by simple psychological events such as leaving home, while severely stressful events produce a higher incidence. Unless a physiological factor such as malnutrition is operating, menses usually recur spontaneously within a few months. Amenorrhea is a constant feature of anorexia nervosa and may precede related attitudes toward eating and body weight. This syndrome is best regarded as a chronic and often severe neurotic disorder requiring combined physiological and psychological treatment, although some evidence exists to indicate an endocrine disorder. Extensive basic research is needed on the complex relationship between the neuroendocrine system and emotion.",

      "title": "Ectopic Motor Unit Activity in Motor Neuron Disease : Clinical application of surface EMG methods",
      "abstract": "markdownabstract__Abstract__\r\n\r\nMotor neuron disease (MND) is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons that control\r\nvoluntary muscles. Due to its progressive nature, the muscles gradually lose their function leading\r\nto paralysis and, ultimately, death. The most common variant of MND is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\r\n(ALS). Of all the people diagnosed with ALS, 50% die within approximately two to three years after\r\ntheir first symptoms arise and only about 20% live longer than 5 years [1]. Onset is typically around\r\n50 - 70 years of age, but in some patients the onset may be much earlier, around the age of\r\n20 - 30 years. Incidence is higher among men than women, estimated at 2:1 [2-4]. The first symptoms\r\nusually occur in the limbs, but muscle weakness may also begin in the bulbar region. Progressive\r\nweakness of the respiratory muscles leading to respiratory failure is the most common cause of death.\r\nBefore the first clinical signs of muscle weakness become apparent, more than 50% of the motor\r\nneurons innervating a muscle may already be lost [5]. In the Netherlands, approximately 1,700 people\r\n(prevalence 10.3 per 100,000) suffer from ALS [2]. Every year, approximately 500 people (incidence 2.8\r\nper 100,000) in the Netherlands are diagnosed with ALS [2], and about the same number of persons\r\ndies every year. In comparison, approximately 570 people in the Netherlands died in traffic accidents in\r\n2013 [6]. The term ALS was first described in 1874 by Jean-Martin Charcot [7]. Despite the tremendous\r\ntechnological progress that has been made in the last 140 years and despite numerous studies that\r\nhave been conducted to unravel the mechanisms that may cause this deadly disease, relatively little\r\nis known about the mechanisms that cause ALS and the progressive degeneration of motor neurons\r\nis often unpredictable. The great majority of patients is classified as having sporadic ALS, and only\r\n5 - 10% of the patients have a familial history of this disease. A complex interaction between genetic\r\nand environmental factors is believed to contribute to the development of the disease. Several genes\r\nhave been identified and their discovery gave new insights into the underlying pathophysiological\r\nmechanisms. At present, no cure is available, and the only approved and widely used medication\r\n(Riluzole) can only marginally slow down the progression of the disease by approximately 3 months [8].\r\nIn this section, first the concept of a motor unit as a crucial component being affected by MND\r\nwill be introduced, together with some basics on how motor units are affected in this condition.\r\nNext, one of the most obvious clinical signs, fasciculations, will be discussed, followed by the varying\r\nclinical phenotypes. Subsequently, the difficulties in the diagnostic process and the prognosis will be\r\ndescribed. Currently, both can be very difficult, especially in the early stages of the disease, even with\r\na thorough clinical and electrodiagnostic examination.",

Both obsessional thoughts and compulsion behaviours make an individual dysfunctional and significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. The nature of intensity of these obsessions and compulsions may vary among those presenting with OCD and some individual may present with multiple obsessions of aggressive, sexual and religious obsessions.",

Los sintomas suelen comenzar alrededor de 60-70 anos y a medida que avanza la enfermedad el dano neuronal progresivo debido a los depositos de PrP conduce a un deterioro mental mas pronunciado, a la aparicion de trastornos del movimiento, ceguera y coma, alcanzando una tasa de mortalidad alta (90%) dentro del primer ano.\n\nSe presenta un caso de una mujer de 65 anos de edad, que acude a urgencias por alteracion del lenguaje progresivo y postura anormal en su brazo derecho, que habia comenzado un mes antes.

Being bedfast with poor caretaker relationships and being socially isolated are risk factors for psychosis among elderly persons. A thorough history is essential to differential diagnosis. Psychiatric causes to be ruled out include schizophrenia; depression, including mania; dementia and delirium; paranoid state; and late-life delusional disorder. Perhaps the most common etiology is cognitive impairment, generally attributable to Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia. Organic or toxic etiologies need to be ruled out, especially in persons with visual hallucinations. Drug toxicity, a structural brain lesion, or a subtle seizure disorder should be considered. If symptoms are not alleviated when psychosocial triggers or underlying toxic, organic, or medical causes are addressed, patients may respond to supportive therapy and low doses of high-potency neuroleptics. The clinician should keep in mind that older adults are highly sensitive to the side effects of these agents.",

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a variation of PMS, with predominantly psychological symptoms. The aetiology of PMD and PMDD is not known.

Diagnosing PMS and PMDD requires prospective daily monitoring of symptoms over at least two menstrual cycles. No effective medication for the treatment of PMS has been registered in the Netherlands.

ASD can be diagnosed if a person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which the person experiences feelings of dissociation, reexperiences symptoms, shows marked avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event, and experiences hyperarousal. For the diagnosis of ASD to be given, the distress must be present for a minimum of two days and a maximum of four weeks and must occur within four weeks of the traumatic event.

      "abstract": "The first part of this paper deals with the psychological background to the most common difficulties in the relation between doctors and patients, particularly when the two parties disagree about the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to a psychosomatic affection. The following causes for discord are discussed:Alexithymia—a mental deficiency that obstructs the insight into the connection between emotional and physical reactions to all types of life experiences;Anal object relationships—a disturbance of the psychosexual development in early childhood, involving in particular the risk of a destructive struggle for power between the patient and the doctor;Regression—the return to a more infantile stage of behaviour in a person who had once passed that stage, involving the risk of mistrust and hatred from the patient towards a doctor whom he conceives as coldhearted and repudiating;Gain of illness—unconscious psychic defence mechanisms that are often misunderstood and may lead the unwise and unsuspecting doctor to fateful errors of treatment and management.The second part describes the tactics for a fruitful cooperation between doctor and patient in regard to the investigation and management of gastrointestinal complaints, possibly originating from psychosomatic reactions to stress and other psychological and social strains.Before the diagnosis is made, it is essential to pursue in parallel two lines of investigation—the somatic and the psychosocial—to avoid one line impeding advances along the other.When a thorough somatic examination has made it clear that the patient's complaints are not caused by an organic disease and the patient's search for a psychosomatic connection has not yet been successful, the so-called redirectional work remains. An account of this work and plain rules for its accomplishment are given.",

The existence of brief, nonconfusional psychotic episodes in epilepsy has received some formal support; these may be a function of temporal lobe subictal activity. Persistent psychosis is found in about 7% of patients with epilepsy; independent evidence indicates this to be a significant association. Temporal lobe seizure activity, again probably acting subictally, may be involved in the pathogenesis of these states, perhaps in interaction with other factors. Occurrence of psychotic syndromes in epilepsy may be relevant to kindling, atypical psychoses unrelated to epilepsy, and the psychotropic effect of carbamazepine.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

In 30 patients with ischalgia pain intensity was studied over 24-hour periods during 7 successive days. The patients noted graphically the intensity of pain on a specially prepared scale. In the light of the data obtained from the patients three types of circadian pain rhythm curves were isolated. In 83,3% of cases the co urse of pain had an evident circadian rhythm returning during successive days. In 19 cases (63.3%) pain was particularly increased in the evening and night hours. In 6 cases (20%) the peak intensity of pain was in the morning hours (5-10 a.m.). In the remaining 5 cases (16%) its intensity was unchanged, without any circadian fluctuations. No relationship was demonstrated between pain rhythm and the age, sex, disease duration, spinal radiological changes, sensory or motor deficit. Pain rhythm is individual feature connected, probably, with other rhythmic processes in the organism, particularly with the rhythm of corticosteroid or endorphin release. Increased intensity of pain may be connected with falling level of these substances in the organism. In 35 patients with a significant nocturnal rhythm of ischalgic pain a trial was undertaken of treating the pain with dexomethasone administered in the evening hours in the painless period. The doses were 1-2 mg. In nearly 70% of cases (24 patients) a good effect of this treatment was obtained. This work based exclusively on clinical observations requires further studies and it is regarded by the authors as a preliminary communication.",

      "abstract": "Aim Clinical staging in psychiatry aims to classify patients according to the severity of their symptoms, from stage 0 (increased risk, asymptomatic) to stage 4 (severe illness), enabling adapted treatment at each stage of the illness. The staging model would gain specificity if one or more quantifiable biological markers could be identified. Several biomarkers reflecting possible causal mechanisms and/or consequences of the pathophysiology are candidates for integration into the clinical staging model of psychiatric illnesses. Methods This review covers the evolution (from stage 0 to stage 4) of the most important brain functioning impairments as measured with electroencephalography (EEG), in psychosis spectrum and in severe mood disorders. Results The present review of the literature demonstrates that it is currently not possible to draw any conclusion with regard to the state or trait character of any of the EEG impairments in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. As for schizophrenia, the most promising markers of the stage of the illness are the pitch mismatch negativity as well as the p300 event‐related potentials, as these components seem to deteriorate with increasing severity of the illness. Conclusions Given the complexity of major psychiatric disorders, and that not a single impairment can be observed in all patients, future research should most likely consider combinations of markers in the quest for a better identification of the stages of the psychiatric illnesses.",

Clinical and health-economic studies allowed the identification of the main factors involved in these adverse outcomes. Some factors are illness-dependent or related to personal characteristics, while others are linked to a wide range of psychosocial stresses. Guidelines have been developed to improve the pharmacological treatment of resistant depression, but they are not easy to implement and therapeutic failures are frequent. The knowledge of the factors influencing the evolution of depressive syndromes gives an empirical basis to assess their consequences on work capacity. It should also guide public health policies.",

Al dia de hoy no existe una cura. Sin embargo, los niveles de calidad de vida y de bienestar psicologico no resultan siempre correlativos a la enfermedad. Aun cuando trabajos precedentes han estudiado la calidad de vida en la ELA, pocos han explorado la capacidad de resiliencia. Veinticinco sujetos afectados por ELA completaron el McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire, la Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale y la Resilience Scale for Adults. Los resultados indican niveles de resiliencia ligeramente por debajo de la media normativa. La capacidad de resiliencia tiene diversas correlaciones con elementos del bienestar psicologico y esta negativamente asociada con la ansiedad y la depresion. Frente a la gravedad de la enfermedad, es posible recurrir a factores protectores, ya sean individuales o sociales, para reducir el impacto y mantener un elevado nivel de bienestar psicologico.",

The difficulty of diagnosing such conditions, the inconsistency of their severity with the diagnostic criteria of depressive or anxiety disorders requiring specialized psychiatric care, affect the quality of qualified medical care, increase health care costs, contribute to the chronicization of diseases, deterioration of quality of life and social functioning. An important problem is the safety and effectiveness of therapy of such conditions, preservation of trust in the doctor and the therapeutic process as a whole. The conducted study confirmed the clinical indications for Selank regulatory peptide and its efficacy in the therapy of not only anxiety states, unmotivated anxiety, mood instability, but also somatic manifestations of anxiety and depression, including asthenic, algic (back pain, stomach pain, headache, chest pain) symptom complexes, palpitations, nausea, feeling of weakness, fatigue, sleep disorders and recovery from psychoemotional stress",

Trois groupes de patients ont pu eCtre distingueAes dont le plus important comporte 90% des sujets examineAs. Dans le groupe le plus important, les crises, de type grand mal, apparaissent aG l'aCge adulte et surviennent de facLon isoleAe ou reApeAteAes en breGves seAries lors du sevrage alcoolique apreGs une peAriode d'intoxication chronique. L'E.E.G. est normal sauf dans la peAriode immeAdiatement post‐critique. Des eApisodes de delirium tremens surviennent dans 1/3 des cas, toujours apreGs la fin des crises. La moitieA environ des sujets de ce premier groupe montre une sensibiliteA anormale aG la stimulation lumineuse qui est en relation chronologique preAcise avec les crises par rapport au sevrage alcoolique et aux eApisodes de delirium. Deux groupes plus reAduits ont eAteA isoleAs. L'un comprend 7 patients souffrant d'une eApilepsie idiopathique, qui sont devenus alcooliques apreGs le deAbut de leurs crises. L'autre comprend 21 patients alcooliques ayant preAalablement subi un traumatisme cranien; il est caracteAriseA par une grande proportion de crises focales et d'anomalies E.E.G. Dans ces deux derniers groupes les crises surviennent sous l'effet ou en dehors de l'effet de l'alcool, mais plus particulieGrement dans la premieGre condition. En ce qui concerne l'E.E.G. aux diffeArentes eAtapes de l'intoxication alcoolique, il est normal chez les alcooliques qui preAsentent des crises eApileptiques, sauf de facLon treGs transitoire, dans les peAriodes de sevrage apreGs un abus, il est au contraire anormal chez les eApileptiques aG crises renforceAes par l'alcool.

      "abstract": "Etwa 95 % der Auffahrunfälle sind als leicht bis mittelschwer einzustufen, über die biomechanischen Abläufe und die möglichen medizinischen Folgen dieser Unfälle werden in der Literatur und in der ärztlichen und gutachterlichen Praxis kontroverse Meinungen vertreten. Diese konnten sich bisher nur auf nicht überprüfte Vermutungen stützen. Inzwischen liegen aus mehreren Instituten unfallmechanische Untersuchungen von naturgetreuen Auffahrunfällen mit Zusammenprall von rückwärts, von vorne und von der Seite vor. Dabei wurden die Bewegungsabläufe mit einer Hochgeschwindigkeitsvideokamera unter gleichzeitiger elektronischer Erfassung anderer, wichtiger Parameter erfasst. Übereinstimmend hat sich gezeigt, dass die gesamte Crashphase etwa 3/10 s dauert und dass ein Schleudermechanismus tatsächlich nicht stattfindet. Das sog. Syndrom der Spätfolgen nach Schleudertrauma ist uncharakteristisch. Eine gleichartige Symptomatik wird bei verschiedenen Befindlichkeitsstörungen beobachtet, deren nosologische Stellung zweifelhaft ist. In vielen Fällen sind die somatischen, emotionalen und kognitiven Beschwerden Ausdruck von Depressivität. Der „zervikale Schwindel” ist nach Ansicht von Experten eine zweifelhafte Entität. „Zervikaler Nystagmus” ist auch bei Gesunden auslösbar. Viele der von einigen Autoren lebhaft propagierten neurootologischen Untersuchungsmethoden sind in ihrer Ausführung nicht standardisiert. Die Auswertung der Ergebnisse ist nicht statistisch belegt. Neuropsychologische Testuntersuchungen können dazu dienen, erhaltene und beeinträchtigte kognitive Leistungen zu beschreiben, nicht aber, Hirngeschädigte in einer unausgelesenen Population zu identifizieren. Manualmedizinische Befunde sind stark subjektiv gefärbt. Die beschriebenen nuklearmedizinischen Veränderungen werden auch bei Depression ohne vorangegangenes Trauma erhoben. Die Veränderungen in der MRT, mit denen traumatische Einrisse der Ligamenta alaria belegt werden sollten, sind in gleicher Art auch bei Gesunden festzustellen. Für die Begutachtung sind national und international klare Regeln erarbeitet worden.",

Depression usually lasts for about 3–12 months, and is associated with more severe physical and cognitive impairments, poor quality of life, and relatively higher mortality. Depression after stroke is readily treated with selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricylcic antidepressants (TCAs). Pharmacological treatment may not only improve mood, but may also result in a relatively greater recovery from physical and cognitive deficits, and reduced mortality.",

      "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of as a response to chronic sexual victimisation and considers what this means for services and service configurations, as well as the implications of acknowledging for policy responses in health and human service fields. Abstract: Traumatic events are those that overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life. However, one particular type of is increasingly being recognised as a driver of many social and mental health problems in those affected by it. The repeated caused by ongoing sexual abuse that is prolonged, occurs in the developmental stages of a person's life, and is often perpetrated by an authority figure is now being more readily perceived as a causal feature of multiple social and mental health issues and the consequent need for human services. Although not officially recognised in diagnostic classification, the term complex trauma or complex post-traumatic stress describes a broad-ranging set of disorders, symptoms and social problems that are not captured by a limited diagnostic category of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People suffering need treatments that are multifaceted and varied to accommodate their particular range of symptoms. Isolated treatment of particular symptoms may only impact on one aspect of their needs and will not resolve the underlying issues that have created the problem. Key points: The mental health impacts of sexual victimisation are frequently acknowledged but there are specific and additional impacts where victims have suffered a particular type of abuse that is: interpersonal, commences at an age where emotional development is affected, is ongoing, chronic or features multiple types of abuse. Many researchers and practitioners in the fields of psychiatry, psychology and social work do not see the mental health diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as sufficient to capture these specific effects of multiple types of abuse and chronic victimisation. There have been calls for an additional category called complex PTSD or complex trauma. The impacts of symptomatology on victim/survivors can be a driver of need for many human services, including mental health, medical and substance abuse services as well as social services like housing and relationship services. Acknowledging an underlying basis of could enhance service delivery to the victim/survivor that may have multiple needs across services. It is important to acknowledge the link between ongoing sexual victimisation and in order to facilitate a cultural shift towards the connectedness of services and a person-centred approach to service use.",
