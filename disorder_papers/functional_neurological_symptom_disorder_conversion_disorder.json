While conversion disorder can present clinically in multiple ways, from nonepileptic seizures to psychogenic blindness to upper‐ and/or lower‐extremity weakness with or without significant gait disturbance, these clinical manifestations all share in common the presence of functionally impairing motor and/or sensory symptoms that exist in the absence of a specific identifiable structural cause, and are assessed to be either caused by or propagated by emotional (and therefore neurochemical) factors.",

      "title": "Syndromes of Brain Dysfunction Presenting with Cognitive Impairment or Behavioral Disturbance: Delirium, Dementia, and Mental Disorders Caused by a General Medical Condition",
      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Therapists commonly hear about vegetative symptoms: sleep, energy level, appetite and weight, libido. These may be evidence of a psychological or a medical illness. Physical signs are clues to the presence of an organic diagnosis and require a medical workup. It is problematic to assume that physical signs represent a conversion disorder or that they are unrelated to the patient's mental status changes. Physical signs with far-reaching significance include neurological soft signs, asymmetry of structure and/or function, abnormal eye movements, disturbance in body movement.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal).

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. The prognosis without treatment is poor once the disability is established.",

It refers to a change in cognitive function that is severe enough to compromise an individual's daily function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia. Dementia can further be defined by a possible, probable, or definite etiologic diagnosis. A degenerative dementia implies disease progression over time.",

      "abstract": "This chapter deals mainly with common acute and chronic neurological problems, particularly as they affect employees and job applicants. The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

This chapter discusses key neurological symptoms, including headache, altered mental status, seizures, weakness, sensory symptoms, tremor, visual disturbance, gait abnormality, and speech abnormality. Primary headaches have no identifiable underlying cause whilst secondary headaches have an underlying pathology. Delirium is a more specific term for an acute episode of fluctuating altered mental status. Altered mental status may herald the onset of a life-threatening or of a reversible condition. Symptoms of weakness include difficulty with activity of daily livings or problems with gait and loss of balance. Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic and oscillatory movement involving one or more body parts. Abnormal gait is when a person is unable to walk in their usual way.",

Dentre as capacidades afetadas, a memória é a principal vítima desta condição. Outras capacidades também podem ser acometidas, tais como a linguagem, habilidade visuespacial, o cálculo, o discernimento e a resolução de problemas. Uma das causas da síndrome demêncial é a hidrocefalia normobárica (HNB), a qual afeta principalmente pessoas idosas, sendo possivelmente resultado de algum trauma ou doença, ainda que as causas exatas não estejam totalmentes claras. Esta pode ser apresentada com a clássica tríade: distúrbio de marcha (atáxica ou apráxica), demência e incontinência urinária e, é definida pelo acúmulo do líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR ou líquor) nas cavidades ventriculares cranianas. O LCR banha o cérebro e a medula espinhal tendo como uma de suas finalidades a de evitar que possíveis traumas atinjam e comprometam o funcionamento adequado do sistema nervoso central (SNC). O diagnóstico dessa doença pode ser difícil e, muitas vezes ser confundido com outras patologias como o mal de Parkinson e o Alzheimer, além disso, o quadro clínico destas doenças podem estar sobrepostos e, muitas vezes, pacientes tratados para HNB podem estar sofrendo também de outra condição. O presente trabalho visa discutir o caso clínico de uma paciente de 73 anos diagnosticada e tratada cirurgicamente para hidrocefalia, abordando os sinais e sintomas, diagnósticos diferenciais e as melhorias na qualidade de vida após realização do adequado tratamento cirúrgico.",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

Each is a definite syndrome with specific diagnostic criteria and a well-documented natural history.

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

These symptoms may or may not be explained by a medical condition. The two major changes to the DSM-IV criteria included eliminating the requirement that somatic symptoms be organically unexplained and adding the requirement that certain psychobehavioral features have to be present to justify the diagnosis. The new criteria also eliminated somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder from the previous definitions. These revisions were intended to increase the relevance of SSD and its use in the primary care setting.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

It produces severe detrimental effects on patients’ daily functioning and social and occupational life like other mental illnesses. Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness. Dissociative conversion disorder is associated with many other mental health conditions like anxiety disorder and depression. Cognitive behavior therapy and psychoanalysis therapy are helpful in the treatment of this disorder.",

Las vias del dolor transmiten la informacion nociceptiva a traves del sistema nervioso periferico y central y estan plenamente integradas con el sistema motor y simpatico a nivel medular y de los centros nerviosos superiores y dan lugar a actividad motora refleja, hiperactividad simpatica y respuestas afectivas y conductuales. Objetivo : Definir los mecanismos fisiopatologicos que se desencadenan en presencia de dolor agudo y las alteraciones que consecuentemente generan en diferentes organos y sistemas. Desarrollo : Las respuestas generadas a nivel segmentario, suprasegmentario y cortical dan lugar a alteraciones fisiopatologicas en el sistema cardiovascular, respiratorio y en otros organos y sistemas. Estas alteraciones pueden modificar negativamente el curso de la lesion o enfermedad que origino el dolor y provocar graves trastornos hemodinamicos que pueden llevar a la muerte del paciente. Conclusiones : Aunque el dolor agudo tiene una funcion biologica protectora, cuando es persistente o no mitigado provoca alteraciones fisiopatologicas en los diferentes organos y sistemas que son nocivas para el paciente. Pese al rapido progreso alcanzado en el conocimiento de su fisiopatologia y el desarrollo de novedosas y efectivas tecnicas para su tratamiento, la conducta terapeutica del paciente con dolor agudo es inadecuada.",

Clinical data reveal that it is not conclusive to extrapolate findings related to grief to a particular drowning event. Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist. Neuropsychological evaluations document patterns of strengths and weakness among cognitive and behavioral functions, behavioral alterations, and cognitive changes resulting from a central nervous system (CNS) disease or injury.",

      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

Pain is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological, and social factors. Pain cannot be inferred solely from activity in sensory neurons. Verbal description is only one of several behaviors to express pain; inability to communicate does not negate the possibility that a human or a non-human animal experiences pain. Many disease processes give rise to both nociceptive and neuropathic pain at the same time. Chronic primary pain is chronic pain in one or more anatomical regions, and is characterised by significant emotional distress or functional disability and can include forms of chronic pelvic pain.",

Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

Here we relate experimental findings of fibromyalgia symptoms to anatomical and functional brain changes. Neuroimaging studies show augmented sensory processing in pain-related areas, which, together with gray matter decreases and neurochemical abnormalities in areas related to pain modulation, supports the psychophysical evidence of altered pain perception and inhibition. Gray matter decreases in areas related to emotional decision making and working memory suggest that cognitive disturbances could be related to brain alterations. Altered levels of neurotransmitters involved in sleep regulation link disordered sleep to neurochemical abnormalities. Thus, current evidence supports the view that at least some fibromyalgia symptoms are associated with brain dysfunctions or alterations, giving the long-held \"it is all in your head\" view of the disorder a new meaning.",

Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "abstract": "Executive functioning is a high-level cognitive ability, regulating other abilities and behaviors to achieve desired goals. A typical executive task can be defined as the capacity to maintain one’s attention on the current task, that is, responding only to the correct but not to distractive stimuli. Impairments of executive functions, or executive dysfunctions, have a growing impact on everyday life and academic achievement and are usually an early feature, and one of the core features, in brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that memory therapeutics cannot achieve their clinical benefits in cognition if executive dysfunction is not effectively and simultaneously treated. Improvement of executive functions might be achieved through targeting some signaling pathways in the brain, including the brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. These agents may be useful either as stand-alone interventions for patients with executive dysfunction and/or psychiatric and memory disorders or as essential adjuncts to drugs that target the underlying pathology in various brain injury and memory and behavioral disorders.",

The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues. Considering the major anxiety disorders, the somatic symptoms in Panic Disorder tend to appear initially in discrete episodes. The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s). Pain disorder associated with a general medical condition was not considered to be a mental disorder, because the requirement was not met that psychological factors play an important role.",

O diagnóstico de CCL é baseado em critérios clínicos, e os exames subsidiários tem por objetivo identificar causas tratáveis e tentar identificar os indivíduos com maior risco de conversão para demência.

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

The phenomenon of medically unexplained symptoms cannot simply be classified into one or a few diagnostic categories, but must be regarded as an expression of a basic mechanism by which people may respond to stressors as in the cases of depression and anxiety. Somatization disorder and related disorders must thus be considered to possess a spectrum of severity. In this chapter, the focus will be on the chronic and multisymptomatic forms.",

Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes.

FNS are involuntary and unwanted and are clinically significant because of associated disability. Functional seizures are one of the most common functional neurological presentations. There are, however, several aspects of the condition that are pertinent to neuropsychiatry.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

The pathological manifestations of cerebral damage are usually believed to be of two general types—first, those symptoms which result directly from the loss of or damage to cerebral tissue, and, second, symptoms not directly associated with tissue loss, but, rather, symptoms of indirect or \"superimposed\" psychological disturbances, e.g., the patient's reactions to or attitudes toward disability occasioned by brain damage.

Cognitive disorders are common in late life and present unique challenges in clinical settings, such as co‐occurring behavioral and psychological symptoms. Psychological conditions arise less commonly in older than younger individuals. Identifying the cognitive and biomarker features of mental disorders represents a major zeitgeist in psychiatry with potential to improve detection of these disorders, particularly among older individuals, who most often have subsyndromal rather than diagnostic levels of symptoms using current classification systems.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome.

Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions.

These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

Brain processes related to mental illness, emotion, memory, and cognition are distributed throughout the brain and modulate pain processing in both the acute and chronic states. These processes can be targeted both behaviorally and neurophysiologically through noninvasive and nonpharmacological psychological therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness-based stress reduction.

Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments.

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained visual loss, or functional visual loss, or nonorganic visual loss (NOVL) denotes diminished visual acuity or field without discernible ocular or neurological pathology. Variously termed in the literature, it eludes organic diagnosis following a thorough examination. Symptoms range from mild blurriness to total blindness, sometimes presenting as tunnel vision or hemianopias. Diagnosis entails comprehensive eye evaluation to exclude organic causes like refractive error or cataracts. NOVL frequently correlates with psychological conditions like depression or anxiety, implicating psychological influence in its etiology. Thus, NOVL underscores the complex interplay between physical and psychological factors in visual impairment, necessitating holistic diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This chapter elucidates the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms pertaining to functional visual disorder (FVD) or nonorganic vision loss (NOVL), prevalent presentations posing diagnostic challenges across diverse medical disciplines. It delineates the historical evolution of terminology denoting patients manifesting vision loss incongruous with established neurological or ophthalmic pathologies, necessitating a collaborative, interprofessional approach. Diagnostic modalities, ranging from meticulous ocular assessments to comprehensive psychological evaluations, reflect the intricate etiological spectrum underlying NOVL. This exposition serves as a pivotal reference for healthcare professionals navigating the diagnostic intricacies and therapeutic imperatives intrinsic to NOVL, advocating for a holistic, patient-centric approach underscored by scientific rigor, and compassionate care.",

      "title": "An Evaluation of Psychobiologic Factors in the Re-Education Phase of the Kenny Treatment for Infantile Paralysis*",
      "abstract": "In addition to being studied as a function of the neuromuscular system, muscular activity should be studied also as a function of the total organism as embodied in the concept of the personality and its functions. “Mental alienation” is composed of a sensory factor (“loss of mental awareness”) and a motor factor (“mental alienation” in its narrower sense) and is therefore not one but two distinct though related symptoms. From the definitions and descriptions of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” given by Miss Kenny and her associates, it cannot be stated with certainty what roles structural, physiologic and psychobiologic changes play in their production. There are certain aspects of these symptoms which bear a resemblance to well recognized psychobiologic and psychopathologic reactions. “Loss of mental awareness” seems to correspond to psychosensory (proprioceptive) dissociation and “mental alienation” to psychomotor dissociation. Therefore it appears that these symptoms may be explained more satisfactorily on the basis of psychobiologic dissociation than on the basis of “physiologic block” as has been attempted by the group of physicians associated with Miss Kenny. “Muscular incoordination” also described by this group is a natural consequence of “loss of mental awareness” and “mental alienation” as well as of pain, spasm and actual paralysis and as such is one of several factors in the production of a series of personality adjustments which may stretch throughout the patient's active life. In the treatment of these symptoms Miss Kenny employs a number of well established psychotherapeutic principles. By means of the Kenny treatment it is to be expected that not only will the chronic physical crippling of infantile paralysis be curbed but that chronic changes in personality functioning also will be interrupted. Careful psychiatric study of case material will prove whether the above concept is essentially near the truth, and to what extent personality factors influence the elaboration and persistence of the symptoms “loss of mental awareness,” “mental alienation” and “muscular incoordination.” Once developed, these symptoms may in turn influence the personality functions of individuals to varying degrees. Finally, this syndrome comprising disturbances in the proprioceptive and motor functions of the personality is not peculiar to infantile paralysis. Rather, it appears to be the psychobiologic reaction to muscular immobilization due to any cause and has as its background not cellular pathology alone but the entire psychobiologic organization of the individual.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An important characteristic of modern mental health practice is the variety of ways in which mental distress and disorder are understood (Colombo 1997). These ‘models of disorder’ range along a spectrum from medical (or biological) conceptions of mental illness (according to which mental disorders are caused by distinct pathological lesions in the brain and hence are no different in prin ciple from bodily illnesses), through various psychological models (for exam ple, behavioural, psychoanalytic, family dynamic), to overtly moral models. According to the latter, mental disorders are, in one way or another, either problems of living for which those concerned are responsible, or labels imposed by society to justify the control of deviance.",

      "title": "Migraine: A Chronic Sympathetic Nervous System Disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective.—To determine the degree of diagnostic and clinical similarity between chronic sympathetic nervous system disorders and migraine. Background.—Migraine is an episodic syndrome consisting of a variety of clinical features that result from dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system. During headache‐free periods, migraineurs have a reduction in sympathetic function compared to nonmigraineurs. Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is also the major feature of rare neurological disorders such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. There are no known reports in the medical literature, however, comparing sympathetic nervous system function in individuals with migraine, pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy. Methods.—A detailed review of the literature was performed to compare the results of a wide variety of diagnostic tests and clinical signs that have been described in these 3 heretofore unrelated disorders. Results.—The data indicate that migraine shares significant diagnostic and clinical features with both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy, yet represents a distinct subtype of chronic sympathetic dysfunction. Migraine is most similar to pure autonomic failure in terms of reduced supine plasma norepinephrine levels, peripheral adrenergic receptor supersensitivity, and clinical symptomatology directly related to sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. The peripheral sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is much more severe in pure autonomic failure than in migraine. Migraine differs from both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy in that migraineurs retain the ability, although suboptimal, to increase plasma norepinephrine levels following physiological stressors. Conclusions.—The major finding of the present study is that migraine is a disorder of chronic sympathetic dysfunction, sharing many diagnostic and clinical characteristics with pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. However, the sympathetic nervous system dysfunction in migraine differs from pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy in that occurs in an anatomically intact system. It is proposed that the sympathetic dysfunction in migraine relates to an imbalance of sympathetic co‐transmitters. Specifically, it is suggested that a migraine attack is characterized by a relative depletion of sympathetic norepinephrine stores in conjunction with an increase in the release of other sympathetic cotransmitters such as dopamine, prostaglandins, adenosine triphosphate, and adenosine. An enhanced understanding of the sympathetic dysfunction in migraine may help to more effectively diagnose, prevent, and/or treat migraine and other types of headache.",

Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

In the sensorimotor examination, typical motor changes include distal muscle wasting and weakness, with diminution or loss of distal reflexes and loss of distal vibratory sensibility and sometimes other modalities such as pain and proprioception.

This can also be the case for general medical conditions for both aetiology and differences in structure or process and sometimes lack of useful biomarkers but this occurs to a lesser extent. There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly. For this reason doctors will always be involved in mental health to some degree and will use diagnostic constructs to describe these conditions as they are familiar with diagnosis in their medical practice. There are examples of clear biological abnormalities that are often detected accidentally that do not require treatment. Medically unexplained or functional symptoms/syndromes are commonly seen in general medicine, although the term ‘medically unexplained’ is contentious.

      "title": "Aspectos psicológicos y neuropsicológicos de la esclerosis múltiple",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders",
      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation. This paper presents a brief review of our current understanding of each diagnosis and gives suggestions for management. Curr Open Pediatr 1999, 11375–378 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",

These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled.

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

This narrative review focuses on the main clinical presentations of cognitive and psychological problems ('mind injuries') that occur postoperatively in absence of ascertainable focal neurologic deficits, exploring their pathophysiological mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention and treatment. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a potentially devastating complication that can involve several mechanisms and several predisposing, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors, which can result in or be associated to cerebral microvascular damage. Postoperative depression is influenced by genetic or psychosocial predisposing factors, by neuroendocrine activation, and by the release of several pro-inflammatory factors. The net effect of these changes is neuroinflammation. These complex biochemical alterations, along with an aspecific response to stressful life events, might target the function of several brain areas, which are thought to represent a trigger factor for the onset of depression.",

      "abstract": "Orthopaedics is typically concerned with the treatment of arthritis, fractures, sprains/strains, infection, cancer/metastasis, spinal care/surgery, nerve injury, and osteoporosis/vertebral compression fractures, all of which are likely to result in a manifestation of pain. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage (Mersky & Trimble, 1979). Pain is not a primary sensation such as smell, taste, touch, or vision, but rather it is an emotional state like sorrow or love. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines neuropathic pain as \"pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system\" (Mersky & Trimble, 1994). Neuropathic pain is characterized by lesions or dysfunction of the systems that under normal conditions, transmit noxious information to the central nervous system. This definition has been called vague, and the inclusion of \"dysfunction\" allows it to be assigned to disorders such as chronic regional pain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Neurological outcome after preterm birth refers to neurologically defined conditions due to disorders of the motor system – e.g. spasticity, dyskinesia or ataxia – which are commonly summarized under the term “cerebral palsy” (CP). Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

Many underlying conditions-including neurodegenerative diseases, CNS inflammation, vascular lesions and traumatic brain injury-can be associated with disinhibition of emotional reflex control. This suggests a disruption of anatomical and functional networks, rather than any specific unifying pathological process. There is a wide differential diagnosis, including depression, dementia and other forms of behavioural disturbance. Diagnostic criteria and rating scales can help with clinical assessments and facilitate clinical trials. There is now good-quality evidence for a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine, with weaker evidence for tricyclic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Pathological laughter and crying is disabling and underdiagnosed but potentially treatable, and its wider recognition is important.",

The majority of these associations remained significant after covariance for Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Executive dysfunction is associated with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional impairment in Alzheimer's disease. These associations may be independent of other cognitive deficits such as memory, language, and visuospatial skills, and may not be appreciated on routine clinical evaluations.

Each subsystem or dissociative agent brings forth his or her own, however rudimentary, experience and idea of self, world, and self as a part of this world. The disorders manifest in dissociative symptoms. Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is often consulted in the general hospital to assess for underlying psychiatric contributions to a patient's physical symptoms. Such questions are typically prompted after a medical or neurological evaluation has not identified the etiology of the physical symptoms, if the symptoms are incompatible with or disproportionate to existing medical or neurological pathology, or if the patient is engaging in maladaptive health-related or interpersonal behaviors in the hospital. Provider countertransference in response to patients presenting with psychiatric disorders that feature somatic symptoms—as well as the maladaptive behaviors that may accompany these symptoms—can lead to provider distress or impact patient care and is a critical area for liaison interventions from the consulting psychiatrist. This chapter demonstrates the approach to the hospitalized patient whose physical symptoms may arise secondary to psychological processes or whose psychological response to medical symptoms gives rise to pathological distress, behaviors, and impairment. It highlights some of the psychological factors that may contribute to the experience of and response to somatic symptoms, as well as some of the challenging interpersonal dynamics that occur in the hospital setting. Clinical cases involving somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder present strategies for making complex diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and effectively engaging these patients in psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",

      "title": "Relationship of the Penn Shoulder Score with Measures of Range of Motion and Strength in Patients with Shoulder Disorders: A Preliminary Report",
      "abstract": "Several authors have advocated the use of a disablement model in clinical practice and research [1,2]. Evaluation of clinical outcome should include measures in each domain of disability[3]. The model described by Nagi includes active pathology, impairment, functional limitation, and disability [4]. Active pathology refers to an “interruption of or interference with normal processes and the simultaneous efforts of the organism to regain a normal state” [4]. Clinical measures of active pathology in orthopaedics include information defining the extent of the injury, disease, or healing as determined from the interview with the patient, the medical history, the physical examination, the laboratory and imaging studies, and the operation [3]. According to Nagi, impairment is defined as any loss or abnormality of anatomic, physiologic, mental, or emotional structure or function [4]. Clinical measures of impairment of the musculoskeletal system can include pain, range of motion, muscle force, and joint stability. Nagi defines a functional limitation as a limitation in performance at the level of the whole organism or person [4]. A disability is a limitation in performance of scially defined roles and tasks within a sociocultural and physical environment [4]. Measures of functional limitations and disability include performance-based clinical assessments and patient self-report measures. Self-report measures of outcome are becoming increasingly popular with clinicians, patients, administrators, researchers, and third party payers. Several tools have been developed and used to document outcome of treatment of shoulder pathologies. These include generic quality-of-life or health status measures, condition specific tools, and tools that are applicable to all conditions of the shoulder [5]. Gerber has stated that shoulder assessment measures should include components of pain, patient satisfaction, function, range of motion, and strength [6]. There are a number of these tools available [7–13]. However, no one tool has been widely used and accepted. In order for a measure to be utilized and accepted, it must first demonstrate acceptable levels of reliability, validity, and responsiveness [5]. This information is lacking in many of the shoulder assessment tools currently available. In addition, little is known about the relationship of self-report measures of pain, satisfaction, and function with measures of range of motion and muscle force in patients with various shoulder disorders. This information could help clinicians be more efficient with their examination of patients, provide the patient with a more accurate prognosis, and evaluate progress based on valid measures [14]. The authors have developed a self-report shoulder outcome measure which evaluates the patients report of pain, satisfaction, and function [15]. This tool has demonstrated evidence of test-retest reliability, validity, and responsiveness [15]. Validity, however is an ongoing process and should be reported in a series of investigations that build on previous knowledge [16]. The primary purpose of this report, therefore, is to further validate the Penn Shoulder Score by demonstrating its relationship to impairment measures of range of motion and muscle force. We also sought to evaluate the relationship of selected items of function with measures of range of motion and muscle force, as well as the overall Penn Shoulder Score. We hypothesized that a linear relationship would exist among measures of range of motion, strength and Penn Shoulder Score corresponding to the level of difficulty reported with selected functional measures. A secondary purpose of this paper was to establish estimates of reliability, error, and minimal detectable change of clinical measures of active range of motion and strength.",

It occurs as a consequence of brain damage localized in various cortical and/or subcortical structures, but mainly in parietotemporal areas of the right hemisphere. Neglect syndrome is a heterogeneous cluster of modally specific deficiency signs and often coexists with changes in emotional status and poor self-awareness. According to different criteria of classification, neglect may be perceptual (visual, tactile, auditory) or motor and it may manifest itself in one or in several modalities, and concern personal, peripersonal, extrapersonal, and even imaginal space. Since neglect belongs to cognitive disorders, it cannot be attributed to basic sensory or motor deficits and it should be clearly differentiated from them. Dynamic changes over time are typical of this syndrome, which is commonly seen in the early stages of the disease and in many neglect patients remits completely over a few months. However, in chronic forms, less or more intensive neglect features may disrupt patients’ functioning for a long time and limit efficacy of rehabilitation. There are many different standardised and clinical assessment procedures of hemineglect. Clinical and functional tasks should be analysed along with behavioural observation in natural situations as well as interview data. Differential diagnostics is critical for planning an effective rehabilitation programme.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development.

Psychiatrists see such patients in liaison settings and clinics for those with psychotic and affective disorders. The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival). Psychiatric syndromes that have an impact on bodily awareness signal dysfunction within systems representing that body and its performance in time and space.",

      "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten. Die Daten lassen insofern den Schluss zu, dass \r\na) bei Patienten offensichtlich antinozizeptive Bahnen nur eingeschrankt funktionstuchtig sind; \r\nb) b) dies auf eine Storung opioiderg vermittelter antinozizeptiver Effekte zuruckzufuhren ist, was die verminderte Antwort auf intravenos appliziertes Naloxon bei Patienten nahe legt.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

Clinical/neurological examination does not confirm any organic basis for the symptoms. Conversion disorders are more frequent in girls than in boys. They are rarely seen below the age of seven. A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered.

      "title": "Dysfunction in Serotonergic and Noradrenergic Systems and Somatic Symptoms in Psychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptoms include a range of physical experiences, such as pain, muscle tension, body shaking, difficulty in breathing, heart palpitation, blushing, fatigue, and sweating. Somatic symptoms are common in major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and some other psychiatric disorders. However, the etiology of somatic symptoms remains unclear. Somatic symptoms could be a response to emotional distress in patients with those psychiatric conditions. Increasing evidence supports the role of aberrant serotoninergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission in somatic symptoms. The physiological alterations underlying diminished serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) signaling may contribute to impaired signal transduction, reduced 5-HT, or NE release from terminals of presynaptic neurons, and result in alternations in function and/or number of receptors and changes in intracellular signal processing. Multiple resources of data support each of these mechanisms. Animal models have shown physiological responses, similar as somatic symptoms seen in psychiatric patients, after manipulations of 5-HT and NE neurotransmission. Human genetic studies have identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms risk loci associated with somatic symptoms. Several neuroimaging findings support that somatic symptoms are possibly associated with a state of reduced receptor binding. This narrative literature review was to discuss the involvement of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the pathophysiology of somatic symptoms. Future research combining neuroimaging techniques and genetic analysis to further elucidate the biological mechanisms of somatic symptoms and to develop novel treatment strategies is needed.",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

Apathy is a state characterized by a simultaneous decrease in the behavioral, cognitive and emotional concomitants of goal-directed behavior due to loss of motivation [15]. Behavioral changes lie in a declining everyday problem-solving effectiveness at home or work. Cognitive changes result in reduced cognitive functioning and a lack of plans and life strategies. Emotional changes manifest in a decrease in affective response to events that previously elicited either a positive or negative emotional response. Diagnostic criteria, or the 'gold standard' for apathy, identify behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social symptoms of apathy that cause clinically significant disorders in personal, social, professional, or other important areas of life. The differential diagnosis of apathy involves its clinical distinction from syndromes such as delirium, dementia, depression, abulia, akinesia, and demoralization. The review can be useful for psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and all practitioners who interact with people at risk of developing apathetic states.",

      "title": "Developmental coordination disorder continues to evolve",
      "abstract": "Motor coordination has classically been understood in terms of harnessing degrees of freedom and performance variables in the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. In clinical examination, however, coordination is often seen as resulting from a selective contribution to sensorimotor processing by proprioceptive, vestibular input and cerebellar modulation. Therefore, impaired coordination (often described as ataxia) typically rules out other causes such as muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, disrupted motor planning, or the occurrence of involuntary movements. This is both a great strength and a difficulty in clinical neurology: many descriptors are based on phenomenological observation, but also have a localizing connotation. For example, dystonia is not any one type of muscle tone impairment, as implied by etymology, but reflects basal ganglia dysfunction. It is distinct from spasticity, which indicates abnormal corticospinal tract function.1 Similarly, aphasia (literally absence of speech) does not overlap with anarthria (absence of articulated speech) but refers to language difficulties that can be traced to other brain regions. Yet, the clinico-anatomical approach is less accurate or is inappropriate when clinical signs relate to brain development.2 In this context, replacing the privative prefix ‘a’ by ‘dys’ sometimes serves to denote the developmental character and signal differences in presentation, clinico-anatomical correlation, outcome, and management needs, as in (developmental) ‘dysphasia’ versus (acquired) ‘aphasia’, or ‘dyspraxia’ versus ‘apraxia’. Growing interest in neurodevelopmental conditions has led many clinicians and researchers to move beyond these semantic considerations. They have adopted a more pragmatic approach to define more useful frameworks for understanding the complexity at stake and assessing intervention approaches. The developmental coordination disorder (DCD) construct has thus emerged to describe a comprehensive developmental condition in which impairments in a child's capacity to develop and execute coordinated motor skills cannot be explained by cognitive or sensory dysfunction or other neurological conditions. In DCD, the hallmark ‘coordination disorder’ is inclusive and not specifically clinico-anatomically localizing. The construct has superseded the restrictive characterization of dyspraxia. Therefore, dyspraxia could potentially be used to address an overlooked aspect of the complex motor phenotype in other defined neurodevelopmental disorders, whether generic (e.g. autism spectrum disorder or cerebral palsy) or specific (e.g. neurogenetic syndromes), which has not been common practice. In many clinical situations, DCD has also proved more relevant than previous concepts based on supposed minimal brain lesions or dysfunction. In 2012, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology (DMCN) published the outcome of a several-year-long effort by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD) to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of DCD. These recommendations were based on sound appraisal of the body of studies available then and endeavoured to translate results into good clinical practice. The recommendations have been very influential in clinical practice worldwide. They have also further shaped and clarified the DCD concept for the provision of service and for clinical research. A wealth of new studies published since then have brought valuable insights into motor performance, executive functions, cognition, visual functioning, mental health, other aspects of ‘comorbidity’, quality of life, assessment, as well as clues to pathophysiology and the potential for improving outcomes.3, 4 The way we approach DCD has also changed. To cite but one example relating to nosology, the fifth and latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now lists DCD as a main disorder under a new ‘Neurodevelopmental Disorders’ cluster. In this issue of DMCN, we present the fully updated EACD recommendations,5 which marks an important, historic step in the understanding and treatment of DCD. We expect these recommendations to improve identification, evaluation, and management of this condition. Hopefully, they will continue to enhance the current practical relevance of the DCD construct and contribute to our evolving understanding of DCD in the wider context of developmental disorders.",

La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico. La herramienta fue desarrollada en Matlab, utilizando herramientas de estudio del EEG.",

The first case describes a young woman who developed a motor and sensory hemisyndrome after surgical removal of a postrolandic cavernoma. The second describes a 16-year-old girl who presented with a mixed component tremor after ventricular derivation and endovascular embolization for rupture of a brainstem arteriovenous malformation.Motor symptoms and signs attributed to an underlying lesion may trigger \"pure\" functional motor disorders. In such cases, the differential diagnosis may be even more challenging.

It is a multidetermined biopsychosocial disorder in which physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical expression of the disorder. These can include: (1) early life (e.g., genetic or environmental) factors; (2) physiological factors including increased motor reactivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which may be enabled by postinfectious events, and dysregulation of brain–gut communication (e.g., altered central pain control mechanisms). In addition, psychosocial factors including psychiatric co-morbidity, major trauma (e.g., abuse history), and maladaptive coping may amplify the clinical expression of the disorder and its outcome. Currently, clinical outcome has become understood in terms of global symptom relief and health-related quality of life.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

When these signaling pathways are deficient or interrupted (e.g., by a hypoxic-ischemic event), the neurons do not migrate to the proper areas of the brain.

      "title": "Estrés diario y calidad de vida en las personas con lesión medular espinal",
      "abstract": "La Lesion Medular Espinal (LME) refiere a un suceso vital mayor que provoca importantes y permanentes cambios. Consiste en un cese de la senal neuronal que oca-siona una restriccion de las funciones motoras, sensitivas y vegetativas por debajo de la lesion. Una LME afecta gravemente a las funciones y capacidades de la persona. El estres diario puede entenderse como de¬mandas coti¬dianas y frus¬trantes que condicionan la interac¬cion del sujeto con el medio. Se ha encontrado que un aumento en la percepcion de contrariedades predice un empeoramiento de la sintomatologia psicologica y somatica. Las personas con una LME se en¬frentan a un amplio conjunto de situa¬ciones estresantes novedo¬sas. La calidad de vida (CV) es un constructo complejo y aun no se ha alcanzado un acuerdo general en su definicion. Puede interpretarse como un estilo personal cuyas caracteristicas serian encontrar un equilibrio entre expectativas, esperanzas y realida-des conseguidas o asequibles. Los objetivos principales de esta tesis fueron el desarrollo y validacion de una es-cala de me¬dida del estres diario en la LME, por un lado, y la medida y valoracion de la CV en la poblacion de lesionados medulares, asi como por que variables resulta mas influenciada, por otro. Para cubrir el primer objetivo, desarrollamos la Escala de Estres Diario para la Lesion Medular Espinal (EED–LME–26). Resulta importante puesto que en la actuali-dad no existe ninguna herra¬mienta para este proposito en esta poblacion. Para su crea-cion se utilizo una muestra de 105 sujetos. Se realizo un analisis factorial exploratorio obteniendose 9 dimensiones del estres. Posteriormente, aplicando analisis factorial confirmatorio validamos 8 de las 9 dimensiones anteriores. La validez concurrente de la escala se com¬probo a traves de correla¬ciones con otras medidas del estres psicoso-cial, mostrando que nuestra escala es adecuada para la evaluacion del estres diario en la LME. Para estimar la CV en la LME, se valoro el impacto de diversos indicadores obje-tivos, variables sociodemograficas, y psicosociales asi como la relacion de CV con la salud subjetiva. A tal fin, se llevo a cabo un analisis de regresion multiple hacia ade-lante. Su resultado mostro que la CV en los participantes de nuestra muestra se asocia negativamente con la gravedad de la LME, con una peor salud fisica, y con un incre-mento en la variable “consumo de analgesicos”. Y hubo una correlacion positiva con un nivel alto de hardiness, apoyo social, y vivienda adaptada. Consideramos que la EED–LME–26 sera un instru¬mento que pueda utilizarse en investigacio¬nes sobre la influencia del estres diario en lesionados medulares. Tambien podra servir al personal sani¬tario, psicolo¬gico y psiquia¬trico de cara a obtener infor-macion util y rele¬vante para la terapia con la LME y tratar trastornos psicologicos colaterales a la LME. En relacion con nuestro estudio de la CV en personas con una LME, se han proporcionado datos de interes tanto desde una perspectiva orientada a la salud, como, tambien, para colaborar con las distintas asociaciones de lesionados medulares y dis-capacitados, de manera que estas puedan emplearlos como un instrumento de sensibi-lizacion de los organismos oficiales. Adicionalmente, tanto la EED–LME–26 como las conclusiones derivadas de nuestra evaluacion de la CV en personas con una LME, podran resultar utiles de cara a actuar en lesionados medulares que no logran adaptarse a su nuevo entorno, que han perdido su trabajo y el panorama laboral no es propicio. Asimismo, resulta importante para establecer una optima relacion social y/o familiar. Logicamente tambien es im-portante que la sociedad asimile a los lesionados medulares como personas validas y capacitadas.",

Concussion—sometimes called mild traumatic brain injury—is different from other forms of head injury. Concussions usually involve some temporary disruption of thinking skills or brief alteration of awareness, among other symptoms. Concussion has many different acute symptoms, and these same symptoms occur in a variety of health conditions and situations, which can sometimes make concussions difficult to detect.

      "title": "What is the place for placebo in the management of psychogenic disease?",
      "abstract": "‘Placebo’ was used to describe fake substances or rituals used by medieval physicians to ‘please’, or assuage discomfort, in patients for whom no cure was available. This placatory perception of placebos led many to regard them as obsolete, permissible only as a comparator agent in clinical trials. Yet, placebo use by healthcare workers is relatively common,1 mainly to distinguish between organic and functional disease, identify malingerers, establish the psychological origin of a condition (to both physician and patient alike) and placate patients who insist on potentially harmful measures when the physician believes that no treatment is indicated.2\r\n\r\nPsychogenic disorders are somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause.3 Features consistent with psychogenic conditions include: (1) presence of associated psychiatric disorders; (2) lack of concern (la belle indifference) or an exaggerated emotional response; (3) disease manifesting only when observed, and not when alone or thought to be unobserved; (4) bizarre or inconsistent signs; (5) presence of emotional or situational triggers; (6) multiple inexplicable physical symptoms; (7) failure to respond to therapy; (8) presence of a medical background; and (9) disease is triggered or ameliorated by placebo.4,5\r\n\r\nManagement of psychogenic disorders is difficult, as these patients often have an underlying organic disease.4 Prognosis for functional recovery is generally poor, and successful management requires a multi-disciplinary approach featuring the psychiatrist in a pivotal role. Empathy and a nonjudgemental manner should be used, and it is often helpful to invoke a neurobiological explanation of the symptoms in order to foster trust, acceptance, understanding and recovery.6\r\n\r\nShould placebos be used in managing psychogenic disease? In its favour are the potential salutary effects and absence of side effects, coupled with the low success rate of psychotherapy and potential adverse effects of psychopharmacotherapy. On the other hand, many are uncomfortable with the ethics of administering an inert substance purporting to be ‘active’, on the basis that it smacks of deception.\r\n\r\nPlacebos have opposing roles in clinical and research settings. A meta-analysis concluded that giving placebo equals ‘no treatment’;7 but there is physiologic evidence demonstrating the power of the placebo effect, which refers to perceived health benefits from prescription of medically inert substances.7 Studies in depressed patients have demonstrated similar metabolic responses to placebo and fluoxetine,7 just as positron emission tomographic (PET) studies in parkinsonian patients have shown robust dopamine release in response to placebo.7 It can be seen how the placebo effect can confound in clinical trials. In fact, the perceived benefits from sham surgery in surgical trials in osteoarthritis8 and surgery for Parkinson's disease,9 have resulted in the move to include a sham surgery control arm in surgical trials.9\r\n\r\nThus, in clinical practice, the physician prescribes a placebo in the hope that it will produce a therapeutic effect: such an effect is anathema to research. Ethicists have coined the term, ‘knowledge framing’, to describe desirable treatment effects arising from proper presentation of information to patients during the clinical encounter, distinct from the placebo (unwanted) effect in clinical trials.10\r\n\r\nWhilst debate rages about whether it is permissible to harness the placebo effect to treat psychogenic disease, few would condone placebo use to treat organic diseases for which appropriate therapy is available. Purists maintain that any practice involving deceit of patients is inappropriate, and that they must be informed of the inert nature of the placebo when it is administered.7 Unfortunately, complete disclosure is liable to decrease the utility of the placebo as treatment or diagnostic test (in which placebo is administered to trigger or halt psychogenic disease). Disallowing use of placebo because it is considered to be unethical would remove from the physician's armamentarium an important tool to diagnose and potentially treat psychogenic disease. As a result, such patients would be susceptible to the adverse effects of medications which would otherwise prove unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne of the criticisms levied against placebo therapy is that it reflects a paternalistic attitude—that of an omniscient doctor who is the best judge of what is right for the patient, making decisions for the patient without need for patient consultation or agreement. It is feared that an erroneous judgement on the part of the physician would lead to his withholding appropriate treatment for the patient who is adjudged psychogenic or less serious.7 This scenario is, unfortunately, not as far fetched as one would hope. Disorders such as cervical dystonia and writer's cramp, now accepted as organic diseases, were once thought to be hysterical in origin.4\r\n\r\nWith the development of the field of medical ethics, we have evolved from the principles of paternalism and beneficence to embracing respect for patient autonomy, i.e. the right or freedom of individuals to make decisions on their own behalf.11 As doctors, we must be mindful of the dictum, primum non nocere, and strive to do right for our patients. Several questions remain: is the patient afflicted with psychogenic disease compos mentis? If not, can a relative or guardian make the decision to proceed with the placebo test or placebo therapy? It is likely that, however beneficent the intent, it can be argued that knowingly deceiving a patient by declaring placebo to be an active drug is an unethical act. It would be far better, perhaps, to practise knowledge framing and provide a neurobiological explanation, describing the placebo as a harmless agent, whose administration is meant to bring about improvement in the disorder.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, there is a place for placebo therapy, as long as: its use is transparent and the patient's autonomy and right-to-know is respected; it builds on and respects the patient-doctor relationship; it tolerates and even encourages the patient's right-to-choice, whilst developing an appropriate therapeutic concept for the patient; and it is engendered by care and concern for the patient.7 Thus, we would submit that the placebo is useful as a diagnostic test to distinguish between psychogenic and organic disease. Upon exclusion of organic pathology and confirmation of diagnosis, a trial of placebo therapy may avoid the need for harmful psychopharmacotherapy, though it may instead be used as an adjunct to psychiatric counselling and drug treatment. Of course, we would not recommend the placebo as standard therapy for all psychogenic disease, but would argue for acceptance of its place in the physician's pharmacopoeia.",

Sympathetically maintained pain is a frequent but variable component of these syndromes, as the sympathetic and somatosensory pathways are no longer functionally distinct. Pain is the cardinal feature of CRPS, but the constellation of symptoms and signs may also include sensory changes, autonomic dysfunction, trophic changes, motor impairment and psychological changes. Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture, with additional information regarding the presence of sympathetically maintained pain or autonomic dysfunction being provided by carefully performed and interpreted supplemental tests. Clinical experience supports early intervention with sympatholytic procedures (pharmacological or nerve block techniques), but further scientific data is required to confirm the appropriate timing and relative efficacy of different procedures. Patients with recurrent or refractory symptoms are best managed in a multi-disciplinary pain clinic as more invasive and intensive treatment will be required to minimize ongoing pain and disability.",

O espasmo hemifacial e uma doenca neurologica com caracteristicas fenomenologicas semelhantes a distonia, porem o espasmo hemifacial e uma forma de mioclonia de origem periferica com contracoesmusculares involuntarias e unilateriais clonicas e tonicas dos musculos inervados pelo nervo facial ipsilateral. Objetivo: verificar a frequencia e a caracterizacao clinica dos truques sensoriais em diferentes tipos de distonia e no espasmo hemifacial, bem como determinar mudancas na sensibilidade espacial durante a realizacao do Grating Orientation Task e correlaciona-las com os truques sensoriais. Amostra e metodos: Osvoluntarios foram recrutados da Clinica Disturbios do Movimento - Ambulatorio Bias Fortes UFMG. Participaram da pesquisa individuos de ambos os sexos, diagnosticados com distonia (exceto a distonia heredo-degenerativa) do tipo blefaroespasmo (n=20), distonia cervical (21) e caibra do escrivao (10) ou espasmo hemifacial (26). Osvoluntarios foram avaliados por uma estudante de mestrado que aplicou um questionario e o Mini Exame do Estado Mental, bem como avaliou a sensibilidade espacial atraves do Grating Orientation Task. Resultados: A presenca do truque sensorial foi maior na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) p= 0,004 e ao grupo câimbra do escrivao (20%), p= 0,001. A sensibilidade espacial da mao dominante dos sujeitos que apresentam o truque sensorial foi significativamente maior que daqueles sujeitos que nao apresentam otruque sensorial (p=0,019;p<0,050). Conclusoes: Mais de 1/3 dos pacientes com espasmo hemifacial apresentaram truque sensorial. Truques sao mais comuns na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) e aogrupo caibra do escrivao (20%). Truques sensoriais sao mais comuns em pacientes com deficits de sensibilidade espacial.",

Pada bidang kedokteran olahraga muncul terminologi seperti overreaching functional atau non-functional overreaching merupakan istilah yang berkaitan dengan kinerja atau performa olahragawan atau atlet. Kondisi ini mempengaruhi proses penyembuhan serta beban latihan pada atlet tersebut. Adapula sindroma overtraining secara klinis terbagi menjadi dua jenis yaitu bentuk simpatetik dan parasimpatetik. Rata-rata cedera olahraga lebih tinggi secara bermakna pada cedera yang terjadi saat pertandingan dibandingkan cedera saat latihan dan lebih dari 50% cedera yang dialami atlet mengenai ekstremitas bawah. Cedera ACL serta re-injury nyadi Amerika Serikat merupakan cedera lutut yang paling sering, dan diperkirakan di AS saja mencapai angka 350.000 operasi rekonstruksi per tahunnya, dan perkiraan kasar rata-rata operasi untuk ACL di seluruh dunia sekitar satu juta kali. Tingginya cedera berulang (re-injury) dipengaruhi oleh keputusan kapan seorang atlet boleh kembali pada aktivitas olahraga sebelum cedera. Aspek kesehatan dan kerentanan atlet terhadap penyakit-penyakit infeksi tertentu juga perlu diperhatikan karena adanya pengaruh latihan terhadap imunitas.",

      "title": "Een nieuwe rol voor stressfysiologie bij functionele lichamelijke klachten",
      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

      "title": "LESI MEDULA SPINALIS",
      "abstract": "Spinal cord lesion is one of major causes of neurological disability due to trauma and non trauma. This disability can cause damage and loss of function below the level of lesion and also has adversed effects on several body systems. Traumatic spinal cord lesion is the most widely reported incidence compared to non traumatic spinal cord lesion. The most leading cause of traumatic spinal cord lesion is motor vehicle crash in children, whereas in old age, falls become the main cause. The mechanism of injury influences the type of spinal cord lesion and the degree of neurological deficit. Spinal cord lesions can be classified into complete and incomplete based on the presence or absence of a function that is maintained below the level of lesion. Complete spinal cord lesion shows absence of voluntary movement or sensation below the level of the lesion on both sides, whereas incomplete lesion shows the persistence of the variation of some functions below the level of lesion. Knowledge on the anatomy of the spinal cord plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis. The level of lesion at the different segments of the spinal cord determines different signs and symptoms, caused by destruction of segmental tissue and disconnection of ascending and descending tracts above and below the level of lesion. The level of lesion is helpful in predicting deficits of body functions that may occur, in determining the next treatment and in predicting the prognosis of the disease. Incomplete spinal cord lesion tends to have a better prognosis. Death usually occurs in lesion with multiple trauma. The leading cause of death is complications due to neurological disability, i.e. pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, septicemia, and renal failure.",

When these symptoms are associated with exercise, a biochemical defect in glycolytic or lipid metabolism, a mitochondrial myopathy, or defect in muscle contraction is frequently suspected. Diagnosis is usually established when such defect is demonstrated histochemically or by NMR. In some neuromuscular disorders, these symptoms may not necessarily be induced by exercise and they are usually part of a wide constellation of symptoms. Some of them are distinct enough to be recognized clinically or electrophysiologically, as in peripheral neuropathies, myotonias, or syndromes of continuous muscle activity. However, despite modern histochemical techniques, a number of muscle disorders remain, characterized primarily by muscle pain and cramps, where light microscopy or electrophysiologic studies show either normal or nonspecific findings.",

Of course, this usage eliminates neither illnesses nor the subjective experience of being ill, but it has implications for forensic psychiatry and for the assessment of a person’s legal responsibility. Having schizophrenic delusions constitutes a categorically different state from having only wishful illusions or a vivid imagination. In the context of medicine and psychiatry, we certainly encounter stages that signal fundamental differences. These differences are easily detected when assessing psychotic disorders or similar states, but a lot of differences also arise when assessing perpetrators with personality disorders or simply antisocial behavior.

Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

      "title": "Myofascial Pain, Fibromyalgia or Fibrositis?",
      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

For the diagnosis and treatment assessment of the ratio of psychogenic and non-psychogenic influences is decisive. The basis is a detailed case-history, somatic examination, result of testing the effect exerted by local negative pressure on erection, intracavernous administration of vasoactive substances and possibly other examinations. From this ensues the range of provisions: regime, relations, psychological, psychotherapeutic (with emphasis on behavioural aspects), medicamentous (non-invasive and invasive), physical and surgical. The limited information of health workers and other people on this problem calls for intensive educational activities.",

      "abstract": "For the clinician, insomnia is a symptom which is difficult to understand as it is a predominantly subjective variable: in clinical practice, it is the patient's complaint which guides the doctor in his diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

Neurotransmission changes may show up in several ways on the clinical level. They also have endocrinological correlations, since the neurotransmission systems implicated in the nociception disorders share transmitters with the regulation system operating at the pituitary level. In this sense, nocipathies exhibit analogies and may be compared to disorders of motricity and behaviour that also show endocrine changes that may be likewise explained. Though specifically different in each instance, the neurotransmission alteration that is a common denominator of these disorders allows comparisons, especially in those situations, such as the nocipathic and behavioural ones, where correlations are relevant on clinical and interpretative grounds.",

Die motorische und sensible Elektroneurographie zeigen eine Minderung der Amplituden von Muskel- und Nervensummenaktionspotentialen (MSAP/NSAP). Veränderungen im EMG finden sich in der Frühphase der Erkrankung nicht. Mit einer aufwändigen elektrophysiologischen Technik wurden Veränderungen der Nerven- und Muskelfaser-Erregbarkeit beschrieben, die als Zeichen einer Fehlfunktion von Na-Kanälen interpretiert wurden. Eine neue, auf jedem EMG-Gerät durchführbare 0,2–0,5 Hz Serienreizung der motorischen Nerven oder direkt des Muskels führt bei CIPNM zu einer starken Fazilitierung der MSAP und eignet sich als diagnostisches Kriterium. Die hochgradige Variabilität der Fazilitierung spricht für eine fluktuierende, dysfunktionelle Neuromyopathie. Sensible Nerven zeigten nur selten eine geringe Fazilitierung. Als pathogene Faktoren wurden fokale Ischämie mit Hypoxie und toxische Entzündungs-Botenstoffe vermutet, die ein Energiedefizit erzeugen und neben anderem Na-Kanäle funktionell beeinträchtigen könnten.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

In order to assess function adequately, the clinician must understand the functional demands of the individual patient relative to their particular lifestyle. The myopathic patient may have a functional disability as a result of decrease in strength and endurance, orthopedic deformity, cardiopulmonary dysfunction and/or cognitive impairment.

Functional (psychogenic) neurological diseases, also called conversion disorders, are involuntary. There are two voluntary mimics of functional disorders: factitious disease, where patients have a psychiatric illness, and malingering, where persons have no illness and are just lying. The term “functional” is beginning to replace “psychogenic” in many circumstances. This chapter discusses clinical features of functional neurological disorders in detail. Negative neurological symptoms like loss of consciousness, blindness, constriction of visual field, motor paralysis, and loss of pain sense are commonly seen in functional diseases, but positive symptoms like convulsion and involuntary movements are more common. Among others, functional movement disorders are not infrequent and have drawn particular attention in the recent years. Within the movement disorders, functional tic-like movements might be difficult to distinguish from real tics, and in fact these two may overlap within the patient.",

However, the sexual problems affecting women with neurological disease are not well described. The etiology of female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions is multifactorial. There are both psychological and physiological etiologies that can be difficult to separate. The more common psychological problems arise from difficulty adapting to a chronic, and sometimes progressive, illness. Physiological causes of sexual dysfunction in neurological disease include disruption of regions of the cerebral cortex mediating sexual behavior and response; neuroendocrine or neurochemical dysfunction; and motor, sensory, or autonomic neuropathy Sexual dysfunction may be a consequence of the neurological disease or the pharmacologic therapy. Female sexual dysfunction in neurological conditions affecting primarily the autonomic nervous system has not been well studied. It is important for physicians to recognize symptoms of sexual dysfunction since there are treatments available that can improve the patient's quality of life.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime.

SSDs present a unique challenge for the emergency physician, whose responsibility is to evaluate for, exclude, and rapidly treat immediate threats to life, limb, and vision, because these disorders are associated with disproportionate and persistent thoughts related to symptoms that may or may not be accompanied by objective medical causes. Emergency department evaluation should include only the diagnostic testing that is necessary to exclude an emergency medical condition because unnecessary testing can be detrimental. Treatment requires an ongoing, multidisciplinary approach with behavioral and mindfulness therapies, and in some cases pharmacologic treatments.",

      "title": "Cognitive Complaints in Motor Functional Neurological (Conversion) Disorders: A Focused Review and Clinical Perspective",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological (conversion) disorder (FND) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by sensorimotor symptoms exhibiting features incompatible with other neurologic diseases. Individuals with motor FND (mFND) typically present with limb weakness, nonepileptic seizures, and/or abnormal movements. However, this population also frequently reports clouded thinking, inattention, and memory difficulties. Cognitive complaints in individuals with mFND are important to evaluate as they may negatively impact quality of life and impede treatment engagement. We provide a narrative review of the neuropsychological testing literature detailing neurocognitive profiles of individuals with mFND. We also present three illustrative clinical cases at the intersection of mFND and cognitive concerns. Several studies and our case examples highlight that generally normal cognitive performance can be observed concurrently with subjective cognitive complaints in some individuals with mFND; this mismatch may be a possible “rule-in” sign of functional cognitive symptoms. Other studies have reported impairments in attention, memory, language, visuospatial, and executive functioning in individuals with mFND. These impairments could be related to medical-psychiatric comorbidities, psychotropic medication side effects, and intrinsic disease mechanisms. When evaluating individuals with mFND and their cognitive complaints, clinicians can use performance validity test and psychopathology findings to help them interpret the neuropsychological test results. Perceptual mismatches between intact objective cognitive performance and subjective cognitive complaints may reflect a negative attentional bias for cognitive abilities that can be targeted with cognitive retraining and cognitive behavioral therapy. Neuropsychological evaluations may provide a useful adjunctive tool clinicians can use to help assess individuals with mFND and cognitive concerns.",

As noted in Chapter 1, dysfunction of the human mind results in symptoms in three primary spheres: thinking (cognition), emotion (meaning), and motivation (ability to set and achieve goals). These disorders can also produce a variety of physical (or “neurovegetative”) symptoms that include changes in appetite, sleep, sexual function, and energy level, among others. Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances. Additionally, patients with serious medical and neurological disorders can develop psychiatric disorders (e.g., people with diabetes are prone to develop depression), with adverse effects likely affecting the outcome of both conditions.",

      "title": "Cognitive functions and social cognition in multiple sclerosis: An overview.",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline has been widely reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) despite its clinical heterogeneity, at all stages and in all subtypes of the disease. Deficits are most commonly present in attention, processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency and executive function. However, MS patients also show decreased performance in tasks related to social cognition, i.e. mental operations thatdrive interpersonal skills such as social perception, empathy and theory of mind. Social cognitive deficits are an underestimated but important aspect of impairment in MS, reflecting how people process, store, and apply information in social interactions. Deficits in these domains have been associated with reduced social and psychological quality of life, even after controlling for severity and duration of the disease, age, and neurocognitive performance. Social cognition impairment is not entirely dependent on and parallel to general cognitive dysfunction, given that some patients experience disorganization of their social life before a significant or detectable cognitive impairment. The decrease in performance of social cognition tasks may reflect changes in brain activity and brain structure, either general or regional. Both subtle diffuse pathology and acute local lesions have at least partially independent effects on aspects of social cognition. The observed white matter damage contributes to a mechanism of disruption in the network of brain connections involved in social cognition. Undoubtedly, there is a wide variability in the relationship of social cognitionand neuroanatomical findings, not only due to the brain's complex connectivity, but also to the lack of a unique operative definition of these cognitive domains. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare study results, given the variability of clinical presentations in all stages of the disease.More research would contribute in understanding social cognition deficits better and in determining whether and what kind of training could be beneficial.",

These disorders reflect pathological processes in the central nervous system and are an important predictor of the social functioning recovery of patients. The question of the deficit structure remains open. In some cases, cognitive impairments are detected in early school age, in others, they appear only in adolescence. At the disease onset, there is a sharp deterioration in cognitive functioning. Further change is also heterogeneous: the same cognitive functions can either remain stable, or deteriorate or improve. To further study the cognitive deficit, it is necessary to distinguish more homogeneous groups based on both clinical parameters, and on the results of performing cognitive tests. It is important for the future of the concept of cognitive deficit to correlate it with the usual conceptualizations, including pathopsychological symptom groups.",

This happens even where clear disease processes are involved, such as the dementias. They may represent different areas of a spectrum of illness/condition and/or be part of a spectrum of illnesses/conditions. However, they share both these characteristics with many general medical diagnostic constructs. For spectrums of illness/condition this may be because there are no natural boundaries but that it is important or seems obvious to recognize different areas of the spectrum for reasons of clinical utility (such as different prognostic implications or treatments) or different clinical pictures. For spectrums of illnesses/conditions the reason for co-occurrence may be because different diagnostic constructs have similar causes/mechanisms. On the other hand, these problems of lack of boundaries are not present as commonly in general medical diagnostic constructs. Alternative mental health classifications do not have the same issues with co-occurrence. They may be more useful in research to discover reasons why co-occurrence of symptoms may occur but have pragmatic drawbacks for other classification functions.",

      "abstract": "SIR–In their recent article1 Kim and Park fail to deal with the entirety of Dr Lance’s classical definition of spasticity.2 His carefully drafted statement documented the consensus of the 1979 symposium of 44 actively engaged neurological investigators (including me): ‘Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (‘muscle tone’) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. This did not preclude discussion of other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from release of flexor reflexes, such as flexor spasms, or the negative symptoms such as the pattern of weakness and loss of dexterity caused by withdrawal of the influence of descending motor pathways.’2 Thus spasticity is not a subjective symptom like headache or diplopia. It is rather an objective observation of the professional examination, like a cardiac murmur or a dilated pupil. There is abundant evidence that the truly disabling negative symptoms, often more impaired dexterity than strength, are directly correlated with the degree of disconnection of the target motor neuron population from the complexly integrated control of forebrain and hindbrain nerve structures. This loss of fine control and force is neither augmented by antagonist muscle stretch reflexes3 or improved by systemic medication, fusimotor blockade,4 or dorsal rhizotomy.5 Nor is the degree of clumsiness directly correlated with the prevalence of spasticity.6 The Ashworth Scale has never been more than an amateur parascientific game, with personal impressions of stiffness and absent replicable physical parameters. Recently, Fleuren et al. 7 have gone to the trouble of proving that the Ashworth Scale is worthless. Occam’s razor requires cessation of the senseless and useless demonization of the spasticity epiphenomenon. Absent evidence-based potions, patients should be assisted to practice toward maximal autonomous function.",

However, both clinical experience and published evidence show that patients with such disorders also report a series of other symptoms of physical distress, such as fibromyalgia and irritable bladder and alterations in vital functions, such as sleep, libido, appetite and energy level. Some of these extraintestinal symptoms can be explained in the context of an evolving comprehensive disease model which views functional gastrointestinal disorders as manifestations of alterations in the interactions between the nervous system, the viscera and the musculoskeletal system. Alterations in central circuits concerned with arousal, attention and fear, cognitions about bodily symptoms and possible alterations in the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis may all contribute to the wide range of symptoms reported by affected patients.",

Irritability may be a non‐specific manifestation of another psychiatric disturbance, such as depression, or part of the emotional reaction to hospitalization, pain and diagnostic procedures. Irritability, however, may also be a mood state relatively independent of other major moods of anxiety and depression. It may be associated with abnormal illness behavior. The diagnosis and treatment of irritable mood in the medically ill are reviewed. Hostility and irritability appear to be worthy of clinical and research attention in psychosomatic medicine.",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

La gravedad del deterioro y la variedad de sintomas asociados a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo o a sindromes epilepticos especificos reflejan disfunciones focales o globales, estructurales o funcionales de las redes neuronales. La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada. Los datos que apoyan la idea de que las crisis recurrentes o la actividad electrica anomala pueden provocar alteraciones especificas cognitivas, del lenguaje o de la conducta, incluso en las encefalopatias epilepticas aceptadas, todavia son objeto de debate. Los datos procedentes de los estudios en animales y la experiencia clinica de las encefalopatias epilepticas de la juventud dan a entender que hay ventanas temporales del desarrollo que son cruciales para el tipo de sindrome epileptico y para el desenlace conductual y cognitivo. Conclusion. El tratamiento de los ninos en los que coexiste un trastorno del neurodesarrollo con la epilepsia es un problema dificil que requiere un planteamiento multidisciplinario que aborde tanto la epilepsia como el problema especifico cognitivo o conductual y que se adapte a las necesidades de cada nino.",

Illness behavior can be unconscious or conscious: In the former, the person is unaware of the mental processes and content that are significant in determining behavior; conscious illness behavior may be voluntary and conscious (the two are not necessarily associated). The first broad category of inappropriate illness behavior is defensiveness, which is characterized by denial or minimization of symptoms. The second category includes somatoform disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering and is characterized by exaggerating, fabricating, or denying symptoms; minimizing capabilities or positive traits; or misattributing actual deficits to a false cause. Evaluators can detect the presence of inappropriate illness behaviors based on evidence of consistency in the history or examination; the likelihood that the reported symptoms make medical sense and fit a reasonable disease pattern; understanding of the patient's current situation, personal and social history, and emotional predispositions; emotional reactions to symptoms; evaluation of nonphysiological findings; results obtained using standardized test instruments; and tests of dissimulation, such as symptom validity testing. Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding inappropriate illness behavior represent substandard practice in view of the importance of these conclusions for the assessment of impairment or disability.",

The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

Since it is usually accompanied by nervousness, anxiety and other negative emotions, return to health can be longer than necessary. Hence much attention is paid to medical interventions which allow pain relief or a total elimination thereof. In some circumstances, however, they may be inadequate, that is why other, extra-medical factors are being explored. Man is a psychosomatic being, consequently, no somatic changes can happen without the involvement of the psychological sphere. In the case of surgical procedures, methods of psychological preparation and patient support play an important role in recovery.",

In some instances, the development of pathology could stem from a series of biological changes that culminate in a particular essential neurochemical disturbance. A drug's efficacy is typically assessed through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Drugs affecting several neurotransmitters were developed, such as the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which, as the name suggests, inhibited the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, and they have become increasingly popular. The SNRIs now being marketed are not only used in the treatment of depressive disorders, but serve in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia , and relief of menopausal symptoms.",

      "title": "Theoretical Perspectives on Mental Health and Illness: Introduction to Part I",
      "abstract": "Mental health and mental disorder represent two different areas of theory, research, and policy implications, reflecting our common tendency to dichotomize healthy and sick, normal and abnormal, sane and insane. David Mechanic (2006) argues that the term “mental health” has no clear or consistent meaning, and in terms of the sociological literature, this is generally true. Mental health is not merely the absence of disease or disorder; it involves self-esteem, mastery, and the ability to maintain meaningful relationships with others. While most of us fall short of optimal well-being (or happiness), those who experience mental health problems or psychological distress have been the focus of most sociological research. However, definitions of mental health problems, illnesses, or disorders are also not so straightforward. Following Horwitz (2002b), “mental diseases” reflect underlying internal dysfunctions that have universal features (i.e. schizophrenia and to a lesser degree bipolar disorder). A valid “mental disorder” reflects some internal psychological system that is unable to function as it should, and this dysfunction is socially inappropriate. For most disorders, symptoms are not specific indicators of discrete, underlying diseases (such as schizophrenia), instead many conditions arise from stressful social conditions (such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders). Cultural processes shape the symptoms associated with mental disorders, and it is important to distinguish mental disorders from normal reactions to social stressors. Horwitz (2002b) uses the terminology of “mental illness” to refer to those conditions which a particular group has defined as a mental illness (and often point to behaviors that are deemed deviant, for example homosexuality in previous psychiatric classifications). For simplicity, we will use the term mental health problem or disorder in this introduction – but students should keep in mind the implications of using the term mental illness. In Chapter 1, Horwitz argues that sociological approaches regard mental health and mental health problems as aspects of social circumstances. He provides a very thorough overview of how various social conditions affect levels of mental health and mental health problems, and in turn how social contexts shape the definition as well as the response to mental health problems. Chapter 1 develops a framework for a sociological understanding of mental disorder and mental health problems and also directs the reader to other chapters in the volume that illustrate Horwitz's arguments.",

Résumé en anglaisDisorders of consciousness after a coma are both a clinical challenge for caregivers and a unique research opportunity on human consciousness for neuroscientists.To set standards in this constantly evolving field, a nosological classification now clearly defines the different states of impaired consciousness and their diagnostic clinical signs.The gold-standard behavioral evaluation of these patients is based on standardized scales that must be administered repeatedly.However, the sole clinical examination is not self-sufficient as sensorimotor impairments, aphasia or fluctuations of vigilance levels can conceal the presence of conscious awareness.New methods using neuroimaging and neurophysiology combined with innovative computational tools can complement the clinical diagnosis and help assess these patients more accurately.Regarding treatment, non-invasive neurostimulation and pharmacological agents have demonstrated positive effects on recovery, but larger scale placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to determine their efficacy and response rate more accurately.A multimodal integration of these new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques is necessary to offer patients with severe brain injury a more personalized and adapted care.",

Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The syndromes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MiND), often prodromal to dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder), are characterized by acquired clinically significant changes in one or more cognitive domains despite preserved independence. Mild impairment has significant medicolegal consequences for an affected person and their care system. We review the more common etiologies of MiND and provide a systematic review of its medicolegal implications. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed English literature on medicolegal aspects of MCI or MiND using comprehensive search terms and expanding our review to include sources cited by these reports. Results: Impairment of memory, executive function, social cognition, judgment, insight or abstraction can alter an individual’s abilities in a variety of areas that include decision making, informed consent, designation of a surrogate decision-maker such as a health care proxy, understanding and management of financial affairs, execution of a will, or safe driving. Conclusion: Even mild cognitive impairment can have significant behavioral consequences. Clinicians can assist care partners and persons with MCI or MiND by alerting them to the medicolegal concerns that often accompany cognitive decline. Early recognition and discussion can help a care system manage medicolegal risk more effectively and promote thoughtful advance planning.",

      "abstract": "Pain is the somatic symptom par excellence, legitimizing more than any other the sick role and illness behavior. The functions and implications of pain are clearest in situations of acute illness or injury or in chronic, organically based conditions in which actual or threatened tissue damage is signaled by its report. Much greater complexity is found in a variety of clinical presentations (conversion hysteria, hypochondriasis, chronic pain syndromes, Briquet's syndrome, Munchausen's syndrome) in which pain may form part or all of the clinical picture. In such conditions the relationship of the patient's report of pain to other phenomena (tissue damage, physiopathology, perceptual and cognitive styles, personality type, individual and family psychodynamics, anxiety, depression, behavioral patterns, social and economic factors, cultural influences) is important in elucidating pathogenetic mechanisms of which several may be operating in any one case. Awareness of the existence and interaction of these mechanisms facilitates the development and integration of treatment approaches.",

These and other movement disorders may also occur as presenting or prominent features of general neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or CNS tumors. Moreover, they may also occur in the setting of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, intoxications, hematological diseases, cancer, or infection. These latter situations where movement disorders are the hallmark of general neurologic or systemic conditions is when clinicians may face challenges of diagnosis and treatment.

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disordersDuring the developmental period from infancy through adolescence, neurodevelopment and behavior are intricately related.The terms neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders are used interchangeably to describe a group of disorders with certain basic characteristics that overlap between different disorders (1-5).Neurodevelopmental disorders (or disabilities) have their onset during the developmental period and persist over a person's lifespan.Intellectual disabilities (also referred to as intellectual developmental disorder), various communication disorders affecting speech and language, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental learning disorders, and motor disorders such as developmental coordination disorder and tic disorders are major neurodevelopmental disorders.Some experts use the term neurodevelopmental disabilities \"to define chronic disorders that affect central nervous system function during the developmental period in the domains of motor skills, cognition, communication and/or behavior\" (4).The World Health Organization criteria defines neurodevelopmental disorders as \"behavioural and cognitive disorders that arise during the developmental period that involve significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of specific intellectual, motor, or social functions\" (6).According the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by \"developmental deficits that produce impairments of personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning.The range of developmental deficits varies from very specific limitations of learning or control of executive functions to global impairments of social skills or intelligence\" (2).The etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders is multifactorial and complex and not clearly elucidated in a large percentage of cases (5,7).The prevalence, as a group, for these disorders range from 5% to 20% in general population (1-5,7).Because of a wide diversity of functional impact from these disorders at an individual level, the effective delivery of healthcare for persons affected by any of these disorders requires participation and coordination between professionals from different disciplines as well as both governmental and non-governmental community-based agencies (5,8).The medical practitioner in clinical practice setting plays a key role in medical evaluation and treatment of persons with neurodevelopmental disorders.Additionally, the medical practitioner plays a lead role in facilitating and coordinating the overall health care, working with different professionals and agencies.In this issue of Translational Pediatrics with a focus on neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders, our aim is to provide a review of selected disorders to highlight the range of characteristics of this group of disorders and provide practical information with direct application in one's clinical practice.",

Research in social cognition in schizophrenia has tended to cluster around four types of social cognitive processes: emotion processing, social perception, attributional style, and mental state attribution. Neurocognitive and social cognitive tasks often share cognitive demands, such as working memory and perception. Negative symptoms reflect a decrease or absence of normal functions within two broad domains: internal experience-related impairments, including diminished emotional experience, motivation to engage in productive activities, and desire for social affiliation; expressive or communicative impairments, including diminished facial expressivity, gestures, prosody, and speech production. It has been known for a long time that, neurocognition, negative symptoms are consistent predictors of daily functioning.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

Disorders of speech movements may be manifest as the only problem in communication or they may occur with impairments in language function. For this reason, and as a matter of scientific and clinical convenience, speech and language typically are considered to be products of distinct nervous system operations. On the one hand, speech can be viewed as the process whereby controlled movements are transformed into sound, thus providing the medium through which semantically significant messages are transmitted. By contrast, language is an organized system of consistent abstract symbols that provides the meaning-based format for speech.",

According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

DSM-5 has changed important criteria and no longer considers doubts about one's gender to constitute a mental disorder. Rather, gender dysphoria is solely concerned with the affective concerns and not the determination of the physical outcome. Psychological treatment for gender dysphoria will generally involve a team approach that incorporates psychotherapy along with medical treatment. Other specific gender dysphoria would be diagnosed when the full criteria for gender dysphoria are not met even though symptoms cause significant functional impairment. Unspecified gender dysphoria refers to presentations in which the full criteria for gender dysphoria are not met and there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis, or the clinician chooses not to specify the reason.",

Unter Verhaltensstörungen oder „nicht-kognitiven Störungen” der Demenz versteht man ein weites Spektrum von Verhaltensweisen und Symptomen, die einerseits organisch durch die der Demenzerkrankung zugrunde liegende Schädigung des Gehirns bedingt sind, andererseits gut einfühlbare Reaktionen auf das Nachlassen der Gedächtnisleistung und der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit darstellen. Diese Verhaltensstörungen treten häufig bereits in frühen Stadien des Krankheitsverlaufs auf, noch bevor sich ausgeprägte Gedächtnisstörungen oder Störungen der Alltagskompetenz zeigen. Es sind vor allem sozialer Rückzug, Angst, Affektlabilität und Depressivität, aber auch Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität, Misstrauen oder Aggressivität. Es kann auch zu deliranten Episoden, ausgeprägten Verwirrtheitszuständen mit Desorientiertheit, Verkennungen und Wahnideen kommen.",

Symptoms may not be reported in conjunction by the patient and may not be coded as ‘syndrome’. Depending on the setting of the consultation, the cultural background of the participants, and organizational characteristics of the healthcare agency, the formulation for the presented problem may vary. ‘Medically unexplained symptoms’, ‘somatization’, or ‘depression’ may be the diagnostic vignettes for a heterogeneous set of symptoms with affective, visceral, somatic, and cognitive components. Fibromyalgia is one of them. In the context of fibromyalgia, this chapter highlights the interactive ‘looping effect’ of the term. This includes feedforward characteristics (what is the effect of labelling a person with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia?) and feedback functions (how does the concept ‘fibromyalgia’ change in response to being used in clinical contexts?).",

      "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex category of clinical conditions defined by a functionally significant alteration of brain function and/or structure resulting from the application of external physical force (including acceleration/deceleration and/or blast forces). TBI occurs along a continuum of injury severity and can produce a broad range of neuropsychiatric disturbances of variable duration. The heterogeneity and complexity of both TBI and its sequelae present challenges in clinical care, research, public policy, and medicolegal proceedings. Some persons with TBI (particularly those with very severe injuries) experience lifelong, disabling cognitive, emotional, behavioral, motor, and sensory impairments. Other persons with TBI (particularly those with history of a single mild TBI) can expect to return to baseline functioning within days to weeks postinjury (Carroll et al. 2004, 2014; Cassidy et al. 2014). The effects of injury and the course of recovery vary, with injury severity (mild, moderate, or severe), comorbid or complicating neuropsychiatric conditions, and psychosocial circumstances all potentially influencing outcomes. Competent clinical practice requires that clinicians consider all of these factors when evaluating persons with neuropsychiatric disturbances after TBI in order to identify opportunities to diagnose and treat common neuropsychiatric conditions, including those that bear no meaningful causal relationship to TBI. In this chapter, we aim to provide guidance toward those ends through a brief review of the definitions of TBI and the essential neurophysiology and relevant neuroanatomy of TBI and syntheses of evidence-based assessment and treatment for individuals living with TBI-related neuropsychiatric disturbances.",

Należą one do grupy objawów pozaruchowych. Uwzględnienie ich w całościowym, interdyscyplinarnym procesie diagnostyczno-terapeutycznym zwiększa szanse na optymalne fizyczne, psychiczne, poznawcze oraz społeczne funkcjonowanie chorych i zachowanie przez nich ogólnej dobrej jakości życia. Choć zburzenia neuropsychiatryczne i funkcji poznawczych mogą być bardziej uciążliwe dla chorych niż zaburzenia ruchowe, to często są one pomijane w procesie diagnostycznym i leczeniu. Ich współwystępowanie obniża efektywność leczenia podstawowego, przyspieszając proces deterioracji fizycznej i poznawczej, i prowadząc do większej niepełnosprawności i śmier telności. Profil objawów neuropsychologicznych w PD jest specyficzny, odmienny niż w innych chorobach neurozwyrodnieniowych (np. chorobie Alzheimera), i obejmuje zaburzenia w zakresie pięciu podstawowych obszarów poznawczych, tj.: funkcji wykonawczych z bradyfrenią, pamięci, sprawności wzrokowo-przestrzennej, procesów uwagi, sprawności językowej. W momencie rozpoznania łagodne zaburzenia poznawcze występują u 30% chorych, po 3 latach — u 50%, natomiast po kilkunastu latach u 80–90% pacjentów z PD rozpoznaje się otępienie. W populacji ogólnej osób w wieku powyżej 65 lat rozpowszechnienie otępienia w przebiegu PD wynosi 2–4%. Wzrastająca długość życia chorych oraz potr zeba podnoszenia jakości życia pacjentów z chorobami neurozwyro dnieniowymi skłaniają do poszukiwania bardziej efektywnych metod wczesnej diagnostyki i wielostronnego leczenia, z uwzględnieniem oddziaływań farmakologicznych i niefarmakologicznych.",

      "abstract": "Patient Scenario: An adolescent female youth soccer athlete, with a previous concussion history, suffered a second concussion 4 wk ago. Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

      "abstract": "A functional disorder is a medical condition that impairs the normal function, but without major organic cause such as irritation or inflammation and where the organ or part of the body looks completely normal under medical examination. The accumulation of abnormalities that limit body functions is a major risk factor for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), defined as a gastrointestinal disorder with abdominal pain or discomfort that is associated with a change in bowel habit. Often, this disorder is accompanied by the concomitant decline in cognitive or motor performance. Pain that in some patients is out of proportion to identifiable pathology is the most immediate and dramatic consequence of IBS and is responsible for a highly negative impact on quality of life and substantial workforce loss. For patients with IBS, the most common comorbid diagnoses include painful bladder syndrome (PBS) or chronic pelvic pain (CPP). Cells of the affected tissues may interact in cell-to-cell manner messages through the transfer of hormones, cytokines, and other mediators that influence normal functioning. The complex interplay and balance between these diverse mediators, ageing, genetic background, and environmental factors may ultimately determine the outcome of the progression of the functional disorder. On a cellular level, these responses are highly complex, involving a vast array of enzymes and receptors of virtually every class, directing recruitment of many types of cells to recover the healthy state. Indeed, a balance between the messengers with the inherent redundancy of the different body systems makes therapeutic intervention of functional disorders a considerable challenge.",

The clinical features of delirium predominantly involve subacute changes in cognition, awareness, and activity levels, behavioral disturbance, clouding consciousness, and sleep-wake cycle changes. In contrast, epilepsy involves the acute interruption of brain function, often with convulsive activity, falls, and injury. States that may share the clinical features of both, such as nonconvulsive epileptic states, are also important: the cause of brain derangement is one of excessive and abnormal electrical brain activity. In such conditions, the clinical manifestations may resemble states of delirium and confusion, and the absence of convulsive clinical activity is significant. Electroencephalography remains the diagnostic test of choice: it is essential for differentiating these two conditions, enabling the distinctly different treatments and epilepsy. Ongoing research and investigation are essential to better understand the abnormal brat mechanisms underlying delirium, and to develop better tools for objective diagnosis.",

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary. Given, as needed, mild sedatives, certain forms of specific treatment in specific conditions, general measures and good hygiene and sympathetic understanding, the patient may be expected to recover or improve.",

The onset of symptoms within 1 month (ICD) and 3 months (DSM) is not evidence based. The symptoms may be depressive, anxious, behavioural, or a mixture of these. A useful clinical indicator that the event was the trigger is that the intensity of the symptoms increases when it is being recalled or recounted and diminishes when the person is removed from it. A number of differentials should also be considered. ICD-11 proposes specific criteria for ICD-11 that include preoccupation with the stressor and difficulty adapting, as evidenced by impaired concentration, sleep disturbance, and so on, causing impairment in functioning. It is unclear whether those diagnosed with AD using the new criteria will be the same clinically as those currently so diagnosed.",

En este estudio se describe el comportamiento de los factores farmacológicos y no farmacológicos que alteran la adherencia al tratamiento, de 85 pacientes con esquizofrenia, dados de alta de la Unidad de Salud Mental (USM), del Hospital Hernando Moncaleano Perdomo de Neiva (HUHMP), mediante revisión de la historia clínica y la entrevista telefónica del acudiente, familiar o del mismo paciente. La mayoría de los pacientes encuestados son adultos jóvenes, de género masculino, solteros, procedentes del departamento del Huila, con baja escolaridad, sin vinculo laboral en el momento del estudio. Se encontró un nivel bajo de adherencia al tratamiento, el cual es directamente proporcional al grado de introspección del paciente, al apoyo familiar y/o social, a la prescripción de antipsicóticos atípicos, a la buena relación médico-paciente e inversamente proporcional al consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, a la prescripción de medicamentos típicos, y a la presencia de reacciones adversas. El conocer estos comportamientos, es un precedente para futuras investigaciones y además es punto de partida para crear estrategias que permitan mejorar la tasa de adherencia al tratamiento por parte de los pacientes esquizofrénicos, desde un punto de vista integral e individualizado a la vez.",

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "abstract": "The development and selection of optimal outcome measures is increasingly recognized as a key component of evidence-based medicine, particularly the need for the development of a standardized set of measures for use in clinical trials. This process is particularly complex for functional neurological disorder (FND) for several reasons. FND can present with a wide range of symptoms that resemble the full spectrum of other neurological disorders. Additional physical (e.g., pain, fatigue) and psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety) symptoms are commonly associated with FND, which also can be highly disabling with implications for prognosis, and warrant concurrent assessment, despite an unclear etiological relationship with FND. Furthermore, several unique clinical aspects of FND make it likely that the usual prioritization of \"objective\" (or clinician-rated) over \"subjective\" (or patient-rated) measures might not be appropriate. Self-report measures may be more clinically meaningful in this patient population. Despite being a common and disabling disorder, there has been little research into outcome measures in FND, and to date trials have largely used measures designed for the assessment of other disorders. An international FND Core Outcome Measure group (FND-COM) has been established to develop a consensus battery of outcomes for FND: a \"core outcome set.\" In this perspective article, the authors reviewed the process of outcome measure development and selection before considering the specific features of FND affecting the development of a core outcome set, as well as a research agenda to optimize outcome measurement in this complex neuropsychiatric disorder.",

      "title": "3001 – Are mental illnesses disorders of the brain?",
      "abstract": "The term \"illness\" implies a medical disease model, namely that symptoms or syndromes indicate an underlying organic disease - in the case of psychiatry a disorder of the brain. But no brain markers could be identified until today, which would indicate a psychiatric illness or in particular a certain psychiatric illness. Furthermore organic causes of a mental disorder are an exclusion criterion for a diagnosis of a mental disorder. For all these reasons all international classifications systems use the term \"disorder\" instead of \"illness\". Beyond the question if mental disorders are disorders of the brain one might challenge the concept of psychiatric diagnoses at all. Most diagnostic thresholds are arbitrary or imposed on pragmatic grounds. For a categorical diagnosis to be scientifically valid, clear symptom boundaries should separate it from other conditions. But this is rarely the case concerning psychiatric diagnoses. In many respects a dimensional approach would be much more appropriate than a categorical view. A dimensional approach would reflect the fact that mental problems are part of the human condition, which turn into psychiatric disorders when the affected individual cannot perform his or her social roles any longer. The personal, social and environmental factors that determine mental health and mental illness may be clustered conceptually around themes like the development and maintenance of healthy communities and each person's ability to deal with the social world and manage his or her life. All this would be much more helpful than the conceptualisation of mental disorders as brain diseases.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

Functional imaging techniques are used primarily to provide information on metabolism, blood flow, neurochemistry or activity of the brain.

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

Clinical evaluation begins with a careful review of medical records. After taking a thorough history, the physician performs the physical examination, including neurological testing, on the patient. The clinical evaluation also determines data needed for impairment evaluation. Neurological examination helps distinguish among the various types of pathology suggested by the history, but to some extent the neurological examination lacks sensitivity and specificity and only about two-thirds (69%) of patients with documented L4-L5 or L5-S1 disc herniations demonstrated weakness or deep tendon reflex changes. To maximize information from the evaluation, physicians routinely test for nonorganic physical signs. Isolated positive signs have no clinical or predictive value, and only a score of three or more positive signs is considered clinically significant. Further, these tests were not designed to detect malingering. Used in isolation, the history, neurological examination, and various diagnostic studies do not have the necessary sensitivity and specificity to diagnose and identify the structural pathology responsible for lumbar radiculopathy. Integrating these components into a logical, unbiased evaluation, physicians usually can perform an accurate assessment.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

The neuropsychological assessment plays a critical role in the differential diagnosis of dementia and can highlight inconsistencies suggestive of other confounding processes, such as medication effects, psychiatric symptoms, or depression. The medical utility of neuropsychological testing in the diagnosis of geriatric patients with dementia is supported by a number of well-designed case-control and cohort studies. A common referral issue in geriatric neuropsychology practices is the assessment of a patient's functional status and capabilities, to guide decisions regarding supervision or independence in basic and instrumental activities of daily living. Neuropsychology frequently is called upon to provide therapeutic intervention in the form of cognitive retraining, psychotherapy, or behavior management in an effort to enhance patient functioning and overall quality of life. The clinical utility of neuropsychological assessment is widely accepted in practice and is supported by empirical study.",

Die Formen motorischer Auffalligkeiten variieren in Phanomenologie, Verlauf und Pathophysiologie, sodass man von mehreren zugrundeliegenden Mechanismen ausgehen muss. Einzelne Symptome haben in bestimmten Erkrankungsstadien pradiktiven Wert fur den Verlauf. Motorische Auffalligkeiten wie Parkinsonismus oder neurologische Soft Signs sind beispielweise mit schlechterer Ausfuhrung von Handgesten, aber auch mit schlechterer Wahrnehmung nonverbaler sozialer Stimuli assoziiert. Storungen der Handgestik als Einschrankungen in der nonverbalen Kommunikation sagen wiederum niedrigeres soziales Funktionsniveau und mehr Negativsymptomatik im Verlauf von 6 Monaten vorher. Einzelnen motorischen Phanomenen und auch der gestorten Gestenproduktion liegen Storungen in motorischen Hirnnetzwerken zugrunde. Relevant sind hier vor allem fronto-parietale Verbindungen sowie Verbindungen zwischen Thalamus und primar sowie sekundar motorischen Kortexarealen. Mittels nicht-invasiver Hirnstimulationsmethoden lassen sich diese motorische Netzwerke prinzipiell modulieren. Erste Ergebnisse einer rTMS Studie weisen darauf hin, dass insbesondere inhibitorische Stimulation des supplementar-motorischen Areals uber 3 Wochen die psychmotorische Verlangsamung zu verbessern vermag. Solche Interventionsstudien sind ebenfalls denkbar zur Verbesserung der Gestenproduktion oder feinmotorischer/koordinativer Storungen bei Schizophrenie.

The discrepancies of the clinical findings themselves sometimes demand attention and benefit the patient when they lead to the identification of disturbances which could not at first be recognized. Selective indications, planned interrogation and thorough correlations with the clinical examinations and other findings are decisive for the value of the EEG in detail.",

Psychomotor poverty involves a diminished ability to initiate activity. Psychomotor disorganization reflects impaired ability to select between activities. Reality distortion, which is manifest as delusions and hallucinations, appears to reflect an abnormality of internal monitoring of mental activity. Each of these three syndromes is associated with a specific pattern of disordered function in multimodal association cortex and related subcortical nuclei. The evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a major role in modulating the supervisory mental processes, though serotonin and noradrenaline are also implicated. While a particular neurotransmitter might have conflicting influences on different syndromes, the differential involvement of different anatomic sites and different neuroreceptor types offers the possibility of successful treatment even when different syndromes co-exist.",

      "abstract": "[ES]Las enfermedades neurologicas son trastornos del cerebro, la medula espinal y nervios del cuerpo, en conjunto conocidos como sistema nervioso. Todas las funciones motoras, cognitivas y sensitivas estan controladas por estos organos, cuando alguno de estos componentes del sistema nervioso falla aparecen alteraciones en el habla y la actividad: motora, respiratoria, cognitiva, etc. Existen mas de 600 tipos de enfermedades neurologicas descritas, las mas comunes son debidas a anomalias geneticas, alteraciones en el desarrollo del sistema nervioso, enfermedades degenerativas, ictus cerebrales, lesiones medulares, etc. Una de las actividades motoras que se ve mayormente afectada en estas patologias es la marcha. La marcha se produce como resultado de la coordinacion de diversos sistemas musculares. Numerosos estudios han demostrado que los pacientes con determinados trastornos neurologicos tienen modificados los patrones normales de la marcha como consecuencia de la alteracion de la actividad contractil, de la fuerza de los musculos que intervienen, o de la coordinacion que debe existir entre ellos. El interes de estudiar los mecanismos de la marcha y las alteraciones de los mismos, reside en la utilidad como herramienta para el diagnostico del retraso motor y neurologico de los pacientes. En este trabajo pretendemos valorar la eficacia de la terapia de la Locomocion Refleja de Vojta como un novedoso metodo rehabilitador de los patrones anormales de la marcha en pacientes con patologias neurologicas de diversa indole. A traves de la aplicacion de la terapia Vojta, activamos en el paciente determinadas funciones musculares de forma inconsciente, necesarias para la motricidad espontanea. Segun la literatura la activacion repetida de dichos movimientos reflejos en el paciente conduce a la liberacion o generacion de circuitos nerviosos bloqueados funcionalmente entre el cerebro y la medula espinal, activando mecanismos de plasticidad neuronal. Hemos observado que con la aplicacion de la terapia Vojta se han conseguido grandes cambios funcionales en cortos periodos de tiempo. Con este trabajo queremos corroborar la importancia de la aplicacion clinica de este metodo rehabilitador. Esta linea de investigacion puede tener un valor teorico anadido creando nuevas ideas o expectativas en el campo de la investigacion basica para responder cuestiones como, ?que mecanismos medulares se reactivan con esta terapia? ?Que circuitos superiores estan implicados? ?Esta la terapia modulando la neurogenesis?",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

      "title": "The critical role of psychosomatics in promoting a new perspective upon health and disease.",
      "abstract": "In an evolutionary model, health and disease are regarded as successful and respectively failed adaptation to the demands of the environment. The social factors are critical for a successful adaptation, while emotions are means of both signaling the organism's state and of adapting the physiological responses to environmental challenges. Hence the importance of a biopsychosocial model of health and disease. Psychoemotional distress generates and/or amplifies somatic symptoms. Somatization may be viewed as an altered cognitive process, inclining the individual to an augmented perception of bodily sensations and to an increased degree of complexity in reporting negative experiences (hence the greater cognitive effort allocated thereto). Somatosensory amplification and alexithymia are key elements in this process. The brain's right hemisphere is more involved in the generation of emotionally conditioned somatization symptoms. Somatic symptoms have various psychological and social functions and are strongly influenced by the particular belief system of the individual. Inappropriately perceiving the environment as an aggressor and excessively responding to it (by activating the cytokine system in correlation with the arousal of the psychic, nervous, and endocrine systems) may be a key element in the altered cognition conducive to ill health.",

      "title": "An improved understanding of neuropathic pain",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain represents a series of relatively uncommon chronic pain conditions, caused by lesions or dysfunctions of peripheral or central afferent pathways in the nervous system. The symptoms and signs of neuropathic pain can all be explained by a neuronal hyperexcitability at the site of the nerve lesion, which subsequently and in a dynamic fashion recruits more central sites. The manifestations of such neuronal hyperexcitability are therefore rather similar, irrespective of the causes or sites of the lesions. The key findings in neuropathic pain are: (a) pain in an area with sensory loss; (b) positive sensory symptoms such as dysesthaesia and allodynia in the injured area, where sensory discrimination is abolished; and (c) an abnormal sympathetic activity. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuronal hyperexcitability has increased dramatically within the last decade, and accordingly, it has been suggested that pain be classified according to a mechanism‐based approach. The challenge for an improved understanding of neuropathic pain—which is the key for better treatment—lies in elucidating the relationships between symptoms, signs, aetiology, anatomical lesions, and underlying mechanisms. At present, this is not a trivial task. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

      "title": "The nature of emotional abnormalities in schizophrenia: Evidence from patients and high-risk individuals",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects about one out of 100 people with symptoms generally emerging in early adulthood. According to the DSM-IV, schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior or speech and negative symptoms such as flattening of affect. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucination and delusions are regarded as particularly characteristic for schizophrenia, although they may also occur in other psychiatric disorders. Besides these psychotic symptoms, which are often treatable with antipsychotic medication, people with schizophrenia experience negative symptoms (social withdrawal, affective flattening, apathy, alogia) and cognitive disturbances, e.g. memory dysfunction, attention problems, and emotional dysfunction. It are mainly these latter problems that cause that the majority of people with schizophrenia are unable to built up a social network, career and romantic relationships, making it one of the most invalidating psychiatric disease. Currently, the prevalent idea is that emotion processing is generally deficient in schizophrenia. Thus, the emphasis is solely on reductions or impairments. However, some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with a reduced ability to perceive and express emotions, with at the same time intact or even heightened emotional experience. This disjunction between emotional processes in schizophrenia was investigated in more detail. Second, this thesis dealt with investigating the presence of emotional abnormalities in individuals high on the schizophrenia spectrum continuum. Emotional abnormalities in people at high-risk for schizophrenia are hypothesized, because emotional abnormalities appear to be a core feature of schizophrenia and would therefore be expected to be present to a certain degree in high-risk individuals. Finally, we investigated the influence of social-emotional aspects on other cognitive functions, such as decision-making, in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high-risk for schizophrenia. The most important findings are that emotional abnormalities appear to be central to schizophrenia and are also present in individuals with a liability for schizophrenia-like traits or an increased genetic risk. This suggests that emotional abnormalities can be regarded as a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. However, these emotional abnormalities do not reflect an overall reduction in all aspect of emotion processing, i.e. perception, expression, experience and psychophysiology. Instead, schizophrenia patients and individuals at high risk report normal or higher levels of emotional experience, whereas the expression of emotions appears deficient. With respect to the perception of emotion, results depend on the type of processing that occurs, i.e. automatic, incidental processing or controlled, elaborative processing of affective information. These findings suggest a disjunction between deficits in elaborative processing of emotions on the one hand, and normal or increased emotional reactivity on the other hand. Moreover, deficits in the perception and expression of emotions appear to be consistently related to negative symptoms, such as blunted affect and social emotional withdrawal. In addition, positive symptoms might be related to an increased subjective emotional arousal. The finding of a particular pattern of emotional abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and individuals at high risk for schizophrenia could give clues about the underlying brain pathology and ultimately the development of treatment strategies that selectively target those brain systems.",

General anaesthesia and surgery have been previously reported as precipitating factors for functional disorders and mostly involve dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures. We report a patient with no psychiatric history or prior abnormal examination who developed sudden onset functional tetraplegia and sensory disturbances immediately after elective surgery, and who was subsequently discharged home several days later after nearly complete resolution of neurologic deficits. We highlight the features of this syndrome, including its unique postoperative presentation, unusual resolution and absence of any identifiable psycho-dynamic mechanism. We also introduce the tripod sign as a useful clinical tool in identifying functional tetraplegia.",

This report presents neuropsychological test findings of 35 Cushing's syndrome patients before initiation of medical therapy, and documents the frequency, nature, and severity of deficits. Performances on the Michigan Neuropsychological Test Battery revealed equivocal or no signs of neuropsychological deficits in 13 patients. Ten other patients had few and mild deficits, eight had moderate and more frequent signs of impairment, and four had frequent and marked deficits in language and nonlanguage tests of higher (cognitive) and/or lower (sensory and/or motor) level cerebral functions. The findings thus indicate varying degrees of diffuse bilateral cerebral dysfunction in two thirds of this population. Impairment was more frequent and severe in non verbal visual-ideational and visual memory functions. This pattern of deficits is similar to that in patients with other types of diffuse bilateral neuropathological processes such as toxicity, anoxia, and infectious cerebral disorders.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptom and related disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of psychiatric illnesses characterized by prominent physical symptoms or complaints that are associated with significant distress and impairment. The conceptualization of these disorders under the category of somatoform disorders in DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000) required that these somatic presentations lack objective organic causes. This latter requirement has been deleted in DSM-5, largely because somatic symptoms often do have related medical conditions (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Even when such associations have not been established, the assumption that they are present has often led to patients being labeled in pejorative ways, as if they are faking symptoms or somehow responsible for their own suffering. The seven disorders encompassed in the DSM-5 category of somatic symptom and related disorders are somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. DSM-IV disorders that are subsumed under this new nomenclature include somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and factitious disorders (which appeared in their own separate category in DSM-IV). Body dysmorphic disorder is not included in the new somatic symptom disorder category and is now classified as one of the other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Prevalence rates in the literature for what were previously labeled somatoform disorders varied by diagnosis, but in general and across ages these disorders have been seen in 16% of primary care outpatients and in 23% of outpatients with medically unexplained symptoms (de Waal et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005). A comparison of DSM-5 and DSM-IV diagnoses in a sample of patients suggests that prevalence rates are similar across the old and new nomenclatures (Voigt et al. 2012). Older individuals with somatic symptom and related disorders are seen in all health care settings, where they frequently overuse medical services and overburden general practitioners (de Waal et al. 2008; Puri and Dimsdale 2011). They often come to the attention of a geriatric psychiatrist after another clinician has attempted unsuccessfully to resolve their physical symptoms. To date, the somatic symptom and related disorders have not been well studied in late life, in part because many of the disorders tend to begin in early adulthood. In addition, research involving older cohorts has usually focused on reported somatic symptoms rather than on specific diagnoses. A complicating factor is that somatoform symptoms in late life are often obscured by comorbid physical and psychiatric illnesses. In particular, these disorders have been strongly associated with stress, depression, anxiety, psychological trauma, substance abuse, and personality disorders (de Waal et al. 2004; Haftgoli et al. 2010; Hasin and Katz, 2007; Sack et al. 2007; Tomenson et al. 2012). DSM-5 is trying to make the diagnoses more parsimonious by eliminating the requirement for medically unexplained symptoms, but additional research is needed to further elucidate their characteristics under the new nomenclature.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a rare condition, however its consequences might be devastating, since it affects patients’ physical function as well as psychological well-being. Therefore, it is not surprising for patients with SCI to develop mental health problems, such as depression and/or anxiety. Depressive symptoms include agitation, restlessness, fatigue, changes in appetite, helplessness, loss of interest as well as problems in sleeping. The presence of depression has been connected with extended length of hospitalization and development of secondary medical complications, as well as reduced quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy. The purpose of this review is to investigate the existing literature to identify the effect of depression on hospitalization and rehabilitation in patients with SCI. From the 31 studies included in this paper, it is obvious that SCI patients with depression have longer periods of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation as well as worse functional outcomes. Moreover, it was shown that SCI individuals with depressive symptoms frequently develop other secondary medical complications which subsequently affect the length of stay and the rehabilitation outcomes. Acknowledging these facts can improve diagnosis and intervention, which may also improve the patient’s recovery outcome.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

Understanding and correctly diagnosing the underlying etiology of challenging behaviors requires comprehensive evaluations along with awareness of the key variables that contribute to the occurrence of these behaviors. The differential diagnosis of challenging behavior is wide and includes mental illness, medical illness, pain, side effects from medications, behavioral phenotype of underlying syndrome, behavioral/functional, deficit of skills, and/or developmentally appropriate behavior. This review contains 1 figure, 6 tables and 83 references Key words: behavioral phenotype, challenging behaviors, etiology, intellectual disability, mental retardation, mental illness, psychiatric disorders",

      "abstract": "Meige syndrome, a rare form of cranial dystonia, manifests as involuntary spasms affecting the facial and neck muscles. Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

Les décharges de cette épilepsie peuvent etre associées à des manifestations motrices, sensorielles ou intéressant le comportement. Dans un cas (Cas No. 6) des crises généraliées survenaient chez un patient porteur ďune tumeur intéressant le méso‐diencéphale.

In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

      "title": "Music &amp; Wellbeing",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Scientific literature suggests that music may serve as therapeutic function among populations with different illnesses or disorders. Functional neuroimaging studies that incorporate music activity or music method shown an increase activation in several brain areas, with widespread bilateral hemodynamic responses in occipital lobe, bilateral cerebellum, temporal lobe, in the right lateral prefrontal cortex as well hemodynamic responses in the left middle frontal gyrus.Music activity can have effects that improve the psychological health of individuals. These improvements refer to modulation of emotion, neurocognition, and behaviour. Another important conclusion is the social function of the music. Music seems to be capable of engaging in social behaviour, involves communication, increase interindividual trust , improve social cohesion of the group. In summary, making music is an activity that involves several social functions.However, is it possible to improve quality of life with music method in severe mental illness? The term severe mental illness (SMI) has been used to refer psychiatric disorders that are persistent over time and that result in serious impairment in one or more domains of functioning, such as social relations, employment, and family relations. Meta-analytical studies have found a relationship between severity of disorder and quality of life measures.The use of music stimuli to convey information may imbue the learning experience with positive emotional associations. Thereby, scientific literature suggests that music may serve a therapeutic function among populations with SMI, including overall reduction in psychotic symptoms, reduction in negative symptoms of schizophrenia, improved social functioning and increase in subjective sense of community participation, decreased social isolation and increased level of interest in external events.The stigma of mental illness remains a powerful negative attribute in all-social relations. Discrimination is also about the conditions in which our patients live in their community. The stigma of severe mental disorders contributes to social isolation and social exclusion. The main goal is social integration of people with SMI in the community through music investigating the quality of life and self-esteem outcomes.Method: The musical activity consists on choral singing 1 hour a week conducted by a professional music with training in music pedagogy and learning strategies and patterns of emotional modulation led by a psychologist.Persons with and without mental illness favouring social integration form the choral group.Different aspects that are promoted:• Musical practice: choral singing, musical language, rhythm, intonation, and technique voice-articulation.• Neurocognitive strategies are directed by the psychologist to improve attention, memory executive function and emotional modulation.• Psychomotor skills aimed to improving the appropriate tone for action and facial and body gestures.• Social skills: active listening, empathy, motivation to belonging to a group.• Participants create a common artistic project: Concert Performance.• Decisions concerning the group are made in assemblies, in which the whole grou take part. People are distributed depending on their vocal tone (soprano, alto, tenor and bass).Outcomes measures: The Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES; Rosenberg, 1965) and The Quality of Life Scale of WHO Spanish version (WHOQOL Bref, Lucas C. 1998) were assessed in baseline and at post condition ( 12 month of choral sessions).Results: Twenty-six people were recruited to the study of whom 13 with SMI and 12 without mental illness. The mean age was 46 years, and de gender were 11 male ( 44%). Statistical analysis shown that people with SMI achieved significant improvement over time in terms of Quality of life and self-esteem measurements.Conclusions: Performing musical activity, specifically choral singing (1hour a week) with SMI along with other people without mental problems promotes social integration.Facilitating contact between people with and without mental illness by creating a common artistic project prevents social isolation of SMI and promotes the wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

      "abstract": "Person with disability is person who is less or more disabled in everyday life during overcoming social,economic and other barriers for whom they are not able to succeed like average people.The main problem with person with disability is if he/she can normally funcionate less or more or he/she needs help from the other person.\r\n Physical disability is when some person do not have hand(s), leg(s), spleen or bile which causes weak imunity, or lungs, liver or kidney during surgical process. Sight lose , hearing or voice loseness after surgical process of carcinoma is sensory disability. Besides general decreased fitness for work there is a professional disability for fitness for work to the old-age disablement insurance regulation. Special part are persons with autism, mentally deficient and psychophysiologic disorder. There are different shapes of disability.\r\n Deaf and half-deaf are people with particulary or complete disability with hearing, in one of five basic human sensory. Particulary or complete hearing transformation disability caused in one or both ears. Deafness and partial deafness is hearing damage caused by sickness or injury.Partial deafness is caused by strong noise during explosion , diving-trauma, on work place and presbyacusis- an old-age partial hearness.\r\n Deaf and mute are people born with this problem and they are special category in this part. Speech disability is less important to the deaf people because they use body language ( read from lips) to comunicate with others. They know what other person thinks by reading their`s body position, movement dinamics, face and lips mimicking approach.\r\n There are differencies between couple in love or violent group of people. Also there is some advantage: deaf and mute people do not have to learn foreign languages because they have universal language. Deaf tourists with different parts of world, language and body colour can normally collect information with any television because he/she receives information from translator who gives hand movements which presents words for deaf people.\r\n Professional rehabilitation is procedure after medicinal rehabilitation. That is group of balanced rules with specifical goal for person with disabilty so he/she can achive\r\n 54\r\n economical and social abilities so they can find good place in community. The main goal is to help to person with disability to recruit or get a new job in case of professional incompetence.\r\n It is important to see how many work capacity person with disability have in relation to the average worker. It is important to see school and personal skills, work experince so they are treated to see performance and professional abilites for particular kind of job.\r\n After all comes some kind of fitness for work, retraining or additional qualification training. After all there is a short maintain program with work and social skills improvement to make a person more competence for laybour world.",

Its evaluation belongs to the workday routine of social physicians. Special difficulties arise if chronic pain disorders are to be evaluated, especially in chronic \"nonspecific\" cases, i.e. in the absence of biomedically relevant signs. Employment-related performance is conceptualised as a multidimensional construct with several latent variables. It integrates and extends the domains of \"impairments\" and \"disabilities\" of the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) of WHO. Three basic dimensions are distinguished: one comprising biomedical, the other psychological, the third function-related variables. They are specified within a multidimensional model of employment-related performance. This includes different components of the perception and appraisal of pain, concomitant bodily complaints (e.g. vital exhaustion), psychological impairments as helplessness or anxiety, special facets of the pain behaviour, and functional limitations and allows an estimate of the chronification and prognosis of the pain problem. Some diagnostic measures are still inadequate in respect of established clinimetric standards. In particular, assessment of functional limitations requires further development and research.",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

There is also the risk that the \"functional\" diagnosis masks - as prejudice - lesional pathologies not adequately investigated with the available technology, leading to serious clinical errors. Moreover, even in presence of a probable psychogenic disorder, patients tend to reject the \"functional\" diagnosis, for cultural reasons linked to the old philosophical separation between diseases of the body and mind (the latter with a \"lower\" status). The current evolution of neuroscience should lead us to the conclusion that all so-called \"functional\" disorders are manifestations of cerebral suffering; at the same time an existential approach to the disease must make us wary of reductionist conclusions, because the clinical expression of a lesion is in the great majority of cases modulated by the culture and the history of the patient.",

      "abstract": "Zdravlje i sposobnost su relativni pojmovi u starosti. Stariji covjek može se smatrati toliko zdravim koliko za svoju svakodnevnicu ima dovoljno snage da se suprotstavi pojavama koje donosi starost, nedacama i svakodnevnim situacijama. Tjelesna istrosenost je relativna i ne ide usporedno sa smanjivanjem dusevnih snaga, a dusevne snage se trebaju pobuditi onda kad je potrebno svladati pojave koje donosi starenje, posebno negativan utjecaj bolesti i vanjskih faktora.\nZdravstveno stanje nije samo posljedica starosne dobi, ali svakako se starenjem povecava mogucnost da se ono narusi i sve brže mijenja. Najcesca stanja koja pogađaju stariju dobnu skupinu su povezana sa srcem i krvožilnim sustavom: hipertenzija i ateroskleroza, u gorim slucajevima infarkt; zatim, veliki je problem dijabetes, promjene u lokomotornom sustavu i sklonost padovima i frakturama. Nerijetko se događa da se uslijed nekih promjena na mozgu pojavi demencija ili druga stanja neuroloske ili psihijatrijske prirode.\nZbog svih navedenih razloga, te pomanjkanja mobilnosti i refleksa, smatra se da stariji vozaci predstavljaju određeni rizik u prometu. Nužan uvjet za ocuvanje sigurnosti na prometnicama su zdravstveni pregledi koji ce prevenirati da zdravstveno i psiholoski nesposoban vozac i dalje upravlja motornim vozilom i dovodi ostale sudionike u prometu u opasnost.\nKako bi utvrdili utjece li promjena zdravstvenog stanja uslijed starenja na vozacke sposobnosti, nasumicno je odabrano 25 ispitanika, vozaca starijih od 65 godina, to jest obrađeni su podaci iz medicinske dokumentacije nakon obavljenog zdravstvenog pregleda kod specijalista medicine rada u Domu zdravlja PGŽ. Rezultati pokazuju da su najcesca stanja i bolesti iz anamneze ispitanika hipertenzija (20%), bolesti krvožilja (14%,) i dijabetes (8%), a cak vise od polovice ispitanika je pretrpjelo frakture ili bilo hospitalizirano. 88% ispitanika je proglaseno ograniceno sposobnima, jedan ispitanik je proglasen sposobnim, a dvoje su proglaseni nesposobnima. Najcesce su Uvjerenja izdana na rok važenja od 2 ili 5 godina Nisu svi istraživaci složni oko odgovora na pitanje jesu li stariji vozaci rizicni, ali statistike za Hrvatsku prema podacima MUP-a govore da stariji vozaci uzrokuju 2/3 nesreca u kojima sudjeluju. Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca.

Serotonin is one common denominator in each of the neurochemical processes, and is one candidate that may explain the underlying pathophysiology. Perhaps the role of cognitive-behavioral treatments ought to be tested, as both depression and chronic pain tend to be responsive to cognitive and behavioral interventions.

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms subjective and objective often appear in health care records, and one commonly hears about “subjective symptoms” and “objective complaints”—yet the former is redundant and the latter an oxymoron. Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

Basically, treatment consists of pharmacological and psychological interventions. Although these treatments are effective, not all patients achieve the same results. In this case, alternative approaches are needed to prevent and treat depression. Our literature review shows that high levels of physical activity and exercise have protective effects on depression cases. In combination with other treatment modalities, exercise and physical activity may lead to a more rapid improvement of the clinical picture. In this article, we reviewed the current literature on the use of physical activity and exercise for the prevention and treatment of depression.",

      "title": "Auswirkungen von depressiven Störungen auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit und die Fahrkompetenz",
      "abstract": "Depressive Storungen konnen neben den Erstrangsymptomen „depressive Stimmung“, „Verlust von Interesse oder Freude“ und „erhohte Ermudbarkeit“ mit einer grosen Anzahl an weiteren Symptomen einhergehen. Folgende kognitive Defizite sind kennzeichnend: Storungen der kognitiven Flexibilitat, des Arbeitsgedachtnisses, des freien Abrufs von Gedachtnisinhalten, der geteilten Aufmerksamkeit und von Teilbereichen der selektiven Aufmerksamkeit.\nDie Bundesanstalt fur Strasenwesen (BASt) und wissenschaftliche Forschungsarbeiten konnten eine Reihe an Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen identifizieren, welche eine ausreichende psychische Leistungsfahigkeit im Strasenverkehr gewahrleisten sollen. Obwohl sich die hierbei hervorgehobenen kognitiven Leistungsfunktionen nahezu umfassend mit den Defizitbereichen bei depressiven Storungen uberschneiden und bisher kein rein linearer Zusammenhang zwischen der Schwere der depressiven Symptomatik und dem Auspragungsgrad kognitiver Beeintrachtigungen gefunden werden konnte, besagt die aktuelle Rechtslage, dass lediglich bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung anzuzweifeln sei.\nZiele der vorliegenden Arbeit: Zum einen sollte uberpruft werden, ob sich die in der Literatur berichteten Unterschiede zwischen depressiven Patienten und gesunden Vergleichspersonen in der kognitiven Leistungsfahigkeit, bei der Fahrkompetenz, bei der Selbstbeschreibung und im Risikoverhalten finden lassen. Zum anderen wurde zu bestimmen versucht, welche dieser Mase hauptverantwortlich fur Unterschiede in der Fahrkompetenz sind.\nMethode: Hierzu bearbeitete eine Gruppe stationar-psychiatrischer Patienten mit unipolarer Depression jeweils unmittelbar nach stationarer Aufnahme und bei Entlassung (neuro-) psychologische Testverfahren. Daruber hinaus wurde zeitnah zu den Testungen eine praktische Fahrerprobung in einem Fahrschulauto durchgefuhrt. Ein dritter Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit bestand darin, die wissenschaftliche Gute dieser praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe zu uberprufen. Alle Untersuchungen wurden parallel auch mit einer Kontrollgruppe korperlich und psychisch gesunder Probanden durchgefuhrt. \nErgebnisse: Die Fahrverhaltensprobe konnte strenge wissenschaftliche und verkehrspsychologische Anforderungen erfullen. Es zeigte sich, dass sich die Patienten neben dem Ausmas ihrer subjektiven und objektiven Depressivitat, auch in einer Reihe von Leistungs- und Personlichkeitsmasen von den Kontrollpersonen unterschieden. Es liesen sich sowohl einzelne wie auch Kombinationen an Variablen identifizieren, die bereits fur die eher geringe Stichprobengrose der Studie die Fahrkompetenz der Probanden mit einem zufrieden stellenden Mas an Sensitivitat und Spezifitat vorhersagten. \nDiskussion: Mit dieser Arbeit wurde erstmals bei Patienten mit mittelschwerer Depression sowohl anhand neuropsychologischer Testverfahren als auch mit Hilfe einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe untersucht, welche Auswirkungen deren Erkrankung auf die Fahrkompetenz hat. Vorangegangene Studien konnten aber bereits die Annahme der BASt, dass nur bei schweren depressiven Episoden die Fahreignung fraglich sei, deutlich in Frage stellen. Die vorliegende Studie stutzt die bisherigen Erkenntnisse und zeigt zusatzlich auf, dass auch bei einer praktischen Fahrverhaltensprobe, die den Anforderungen der BASt entspricht, nicht von vergleichbaren Leistungen bei depressiven Patienten und gesunden Kontrollen auszugehen ist. Die geringe Stichprobengrose lasst allerdings eine Generalisierung der Ergebnisse nicht zu. Weitere Forschungsarbeit in dieser Richtung ist erforderlich.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), historically referred to as pseudoseizures or hysterical seizures, are sudden disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathy may be difficult to distinguish from neuronopathy, on both motor and sensory sides. A number of disorders that present with characteristic electro-clinical features are readily recognized. Except for those, distinction of the lesions that concern the peripheral nerve cell or the axon may require support of clinical, electrophysiological and other ancillary tests. Distinction between motor neuropathy and neuronopathy can be based on the abnormalities of nerve conduction and on the signs that relate to the reinnervation process. Signs of terminal axonal reinnervation, such as motor axon reflex, may be observed in axonal neuronopathies, whereas only collateral reinnervation occurs in motor neuronopathies. Sensory axonopathies are usually characterized by clinical and electrophysiological findings that are axon length-dependent, by the course of the disorder that is most often chronic, and by possible reversibility. Sensory neuronopathies are usually subacute and induce clinical deficits that are more or less widespread to the whole body surface rather than distal. Follow-up studies disclose limited or absent recovery. A better knowledge of the structural differences of motor and sensory neurons and axons will improve our understanding and lead to the development of specific tests. Meanwhile, although some parameters and techniques should still be improved, electrophysiological and additional tests are useful to detect and to distinguish the peripheral nerve disorders that affect the nerve cell bodies and their axons.",

The central nervous system is no exception to this principle. And this is no less true whether one deals with disease directly involving the central nervous system or with the effects on it of disease having its origin elsewhere. This report is concerned with secondary effects. Neuropsychiatric complications of underlying disease may vary widely from mild aberrations of normal mood and behavior to sweeping disturbances that dominate the entire clinical picture and may obscure the disease itself. The basis for these reactions depends primarily on the fundamental nature of brain metabolism. The central nervous system has the most exacting metabolic requirements in the body.

In order to better understand which components of executive functioning (inhibition, shifting and/or updating) might be especially affected by pain and which mechanisms might underlie this association, we conducted a systematic review, including both chronic-pain studies as well as experimental-pain studies. The chronic-pain studies (N = 57) show that pain is associated with poorer executive functioning. The findings of experimental-pain studies (N = 28) suggest that this might be a bidirectional relationship: Pain can disrupt executive functioning, but poorer executive functioning might also be a risk factor for higher vulnerability to pain.",

However, recent studies of neuroimaging as well as analysis of blood markers, energy metabolism and mitochondrial function have revealed many objective biological abnormalities.

Sensory symptoms were not reported and mild sensory signs were found in six patients. Electrophysiological abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of neuropathy were found in 16 patients (17%).

      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders are defined as syndromes characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation or behavior, which reflect a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. These are often associated with suffering or disabilities. It is known that one of the striking characteristics of certain disorders is related to their chronicity, which reduces the possibility of a cure and raises the discussion about controlling their symptoms to maintain the quality of life of individuals who suffer from them. A little associated but relevant intervention, if the state of chronic users in mental health is analyzed, is palliative care and its palliative actions that do not seek a cure, but to offer the maximum possible comfort to the user from diagnosis until their last day of life. Objective: Gather and analyze information regarding palliative psychiatry and its benefits for patients with mental disorders. Methodology: Articles published in indexed journals in the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SCIELO), National Library of Medicine/NLM (MEDLINE), and National Library of Medicine/NLM (PUBMED) databases were evaluated, in addition to official sites such as the Ministry of Health of Brazil and the World Health Organization, covering the period from 2014 to 2024. Results and Discussion: After completing the data collection phase, 33 relevant articles were identified for analysis of the proposed theme. It has been noted that palliative psychiatry encompasses a wide range of issues, including widely known mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression, severe mental illnesses refractory to treatment, neuropalliative care, and symptom burden at various levels. Furthermore, it addresses ethical and psychosocial problems, psychological suffering, personality, desire and desire to die, dignity, loneliness, social isolation, as well as psychopharmacology. And that this care would be advantageous and of fundamental importance to patients with serious mental illnesses. Conclusion: Given the new perspectives for mental health care in an increasingly humanized way, the articles highlighted the benefits of palliative psychiatry and its importance in improving the quality of life of patients with serious mental disorders. However, it was also observed that many barriers need to be overcome to guarantee quality care for the group in question.",

In de Nederlandse vertaling van de DSM-5 heet de stoornis Coordinatieontwikkelingsstoornis (DSM-5, 2014). De term ontwikkelingsdyspraxie is nog in gebruik in de medische praktijk.

      "abstract": "Neuropathic osteoarthropathy (NOAP) describes a spectrum of destructive changes in bones and joints as a result of a neurosensory deficit.1 Neuropathic osteoarthropathy is known by various other names, including but not limited to neuro-osteoarthropathy, neuropathic arthropathy, Charcot arthropathy, Charcot joint, or neuropathic joint. A combination of sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction culminates in loss of joint proprioception and loss of sensation in the joint.2 The loss of pain perception and altered biomechanics ultimately result in joint dissolution. This disorder most commonly affects the weight-bearing joints of the lower limb and, to a lesser extent, the upper extremities and the spine. The neuropathic joint is predisposed to arthrosis, alignment deformities, fractures, and infections.1–3 The location and extent of changes depend on whether the neuropathy is central or peripheral and the degree of loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function. Various neuropathic conditions have a predilection for specific joints. Consequently, with this knowledge the radiologist often is able to suggest the correct etiology for the radiographic findings.",

This problem of definition and the lack of uniformity in such services in different settings may partly result in the marked under-utilisation of psychiatric expertise in dealing with the large number of medical patients who have a psychiatric disorder regardless of the presence or absence of a physical illness.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is characterized by a variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Information-processing dysfunctions differ between clinical subtypes such that nonparanoid schizophrenia patients attend less than paranoid schizophrenia patients to connotative or contextual aspects of stimuli. The positive and negative symptom dimensions are also associated with distinct cognitive deficits. In general, positive symptoms are related to auditory-processing deficits and negative symptoms to visual/motor dysfunctions. The interaction of frontal and septohippocampal brain systems, and failures of information-processing automaticity and self-monitoring, have been proposed as the bases of positive symptoms. Negative symptoms are thought to arise from abnormalities in the complex interactions of frontal and striatal systems. Recent theoretical analyses have recommended a focus on the cognitive and neuropsychological analysis of specific symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) instead of on the more heterogeneous symptom clusters or dimensions. Studies of specific symptoms indicate that patients with hallucinations have deficits in discriminating the source of information. Delusions have been related to abnormal inference processes as well as abnormal perceptual experiences. Studies should now examine the links between information-processing abnormalities and symptoms over time, as the latter change, within the framework of explicit, disconfirmable theoretical models.",

Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis.

      "title": "АНАЛІЗ ПСИХОЛОГІЧНИХ ПІДХОДІВ ДО РОЗУМІННЯ ПРОБЛЕМИ НЕВРОТИЧНИХ РОЗЛАДІВ",
      "abstract": "Стаття являє собою узагальнення проблеми розвитку невротичних порушень як психологічних феноменів, що слід позначати терміном «розлади». Сутність проблеми зводиться до того, що сучасна область діагностики не містить чіткої границі між психологічними визначеннями невротичних розладів та психопатологічними симптомами, які регламентовано новою класифікацією психічних та поведінкових розладів. &#x0D; Автор стверджує, що симптоми невротичних порушень за своєю суттю не розрізняються як від функціональних розладів здорових суб’єктів, так і симптомів, які мають місце в процесі різних соматичних захворювань. Наголошується про розвиток неврозів як порушень, що не призводять до органічного ураження системи органів, зокрема і центральної нервової системи, які відображають специфічні клінічні прояви при відсутності патопсихотичної симптоматики, й переважно ідентифікуються нервово-психічним розладом у процесі руйнації значущих соціальних зв’язків особистості.&#x0D; У дослідженні звертається увага на одну із нагальних проблем в області кризового консультування – проблема реакції суб’єкта на психологічний стрес. Автором зазначено трактування поняття «стрес», яке розкривається через вплив на особистість психотравмуючих подій з розвитком розладів продромальних індивідуально-психологічних особливостей, що сприяє появі невротичного синдромогенезу.&#x0D; Як повідомляє автор, терапевтична робота, а саме психологічне консультування, являється цінним компонентом як в індивідуальній терапії, так і у комплексному лікуванні і реабілітації суб’єктів з невротичними розладами.",

Two stages of old age are currently recognized: early old age (65 to 75 years) and over 75 years - late old age period. Old age period is the third life cycle period in which aging of the brain and eventual pathological changes with respective organic psychopathological onsets are finalized. In many countries, number of the population over 65 years of age increases. The same applies for our country. Term of psychic disorders includes miscellaneous psychic conditions, pathologic in terms of symptom intensity, personality and social behavior changes, and reflects on social life of the ill individual and its family. Psychiatric syndromes and disorders in older population Rogina divides into two groups: - disorders of emotional reacting and behavior, without manifestations of other organic brain or physical disorders and - alternations caused by primary brain pathology, clinically presented as organic brain psycho-syndrome with different intensity and different pathogenesis etymology (cardiovascular, cerebro-vascular, neoplastic, metabolic, etc.) A combination of physical illness and mental disorder is the most common cause of the first hospitalization in older age.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders and the epilepsies share common etiologies and pathologies. The severity of impairment and the variety of symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or with particular epilepsy syndromes reflect focal or global, structural or functional dysfunction of neuronal networks. The complex relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy is secondary to common factors that include genetics, cognition, motor and language function. The epileptic encephalopathies are associated with regression or slowing of cognitive, language or behavior and the accepted working hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the seizures or of the interictal epileptiform activity, as opposed to the associated medical condition. The evidence that recurrent seizures or abnormal electrical activity can cause specific cognitive, language or behavioral abnormalities even in accepted epileptic encephalopathies is still controversial. Data from animal studies and the clinical experience from epileptic encephalopathies of early life imply that there are developmental time windows crucial to the type of epilepsy syndrome and to cognitive and behavioral outcome.The management of children in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder coexists with epilepsy is a difficult problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the epilepsy and the specific cognitive or behavioral problem and is tailored to the needs of the individual child.",

Einleitend wird auf die Sorgfaltspflicht eines Lenkers verwiesen. Jeder Kraftfahrer hat sich vor der Inbetriebnahme eines Fahrzeuges stets zu vergewissern, dass er nach seinen koerperlichen und geistigen Faehigkeiten dazu (noch) imstande ist, den Anforderungen des Strassenverkehrs zu genuegen. Wirkungen oder Nebenwirkungen von Medikamenten koennen eine Reihe von physischen oder psychischen Stoerungen verursachen, welche die Verkehrstauglichkeit herabsetzen. Als verkehrsmedizinisch relevant muessen alle Pharmaka gelten, die einen zentralen Angriffspunkt haben. Die Wirkungen der in Betracht kommenden Medikamente haengen jedoch von verschiedensten Faktoren und der individuellen Situation des Betroffenen ab. Prinzipiell ist zu sagen, dass eine medikamentenbedingte Fahruntuechtigkeit ein normatives Tatbestandsmerkmal ist, dem ein vorsaetzliches oder fahrlaessiges Verhalten zugrunde liegen kann. Die rechtliche Entscheidung ueber die Verschuldensfrage und die Schuldform haengt davon ab, ob und gegebenenfalls wie der betroffene Lenker vor oder waehrend der Fahrt die Wirkung der konsumierten Medikamente im Hinblick auf seine Fahrsicherheit beurteilt hat und beurteilen musste. Da jeder Fahrzeuglenker vor Antritt der Fahrt verpflichtet ist, seine Fahrtuechtigkeit zu pruefen, handelt er im Falle einer mangelnden eigenen Vorsorge fahrlaessig. Auf die verschiedenen Moeglichkeiten eines Kraftfahrers, eine Fahruntuechtigkeit vorauszusehen, wird eingegangen. Ein Kraftfahrer, der sich gegen aerztlichen Rat nach Einnahme eines Medikamentes ans Steuer setzt, handelt schuldhaft. Der Autor geht weiters auf Arzneimittelinteraktionen bei Einnahme von 2 oder mehreren Medikamenten gleichzeitig, auf das Zusammenwirken von Medikamenten und Alkohol sowie auf alkoholhaltige Medikamente und die im jeweiligen Fall zu erfuellenden Sorgfaltspflichten des Lenkers ein.

La cirugia funcional ha adquirido gran relevancia en el tratamiento de las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, y menos conocida es la influencia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) en los sintomas no motores (SNM). Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia sobre ECP y SNM en la EP. Desarrollo. Los resultados de la cirugia funcional sobre los SNM de la EP son variables en los distintos estudios. Algunos sintomas mejoran -trastornos del sueno, dolor o disconfort, trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos- y empeoran o aparecen otros -fluencia verbal, apatia, aumento de peso-. En estudios aislados se encuentra mejoria en memoria de trabajo, secuenciacion visuomotora y razonamiento, algunos trastornos digestivos, genitourinarios, de termorregulacion y olfativos, y empeoran la memoria verbal (recuerdo diferido) y visuoespacial, la velocidad psicomotora y la funcion ejecutiva, mientras que otros sintomas -hipotension ortostatica- no muestran cambios. Existen otros factores, ademas de la estimulacion, que pueden modificar los SNM, como la vulnerabilidad preoperatoria individual, la disminucion de medicacion dopaminergica tras la cirugia, la propia EP y los cambios psicosociales. En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-. Conclusiones. Es necesario valorar el riesgo-beneficio individualmente para obtener resultados optimos con este tratamiento. Se requieren estudios multicentricos que permitan esclarecer el papel de la ECP sobre los SNM.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

Chronic pain is difficult to treat and often the interventions fail. This failure is, in part due to the fact that chronic pains usually result as a manifestation of some chronic degenerative, inflammatory or neoplastic process. As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs. The patient may not receive the treatment for appropriate time and dosage due to the side effects. Furthermore, indication of specific treatment modality depends upon the evidence of positive effects of the modality, as indicated in various control trials or the related literature2.",

Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) does not list malingering in its diagnostic section and therefore does not identify it as a formal mental disorder, malingering and verified mental illness commonly coexist. Some subtypes of feigning behaviors, such as partial or pure malingering, dissimulation, and false imputation, can be suspected when patients have marked discrepancies between reported stressors and objective findings. The article discusses these three theoretical concepts with their possible clinical aspects, illustrating each phenomenon by clinical case with self-reported and/or observed psychotic symptoms. We summarized relevant findings and provided a review of clinical considerations that physicians can use to aid in the evaluation of psychotic symptoms in the context of those three concepts.",

Si bien sabemos que la causa de la enfermedad es una afectacion cerebral, se desconoce, no solo la etiologia de dicha afectacion, sino el momento en que esta sucede, su posterior evolucion y los factores pronosticos. Una de las manifestaciones de esta afectacion cerebral, es el deterioro cognitivo. El deterioro cognitivo propio de la esquizofrenia se ha demostrado que no es difuso o generalizado, sino que afecta de forma diferencial y especifica a la atencion, memoria de trabajo, memoria y funciones ejecutivas, si bien es cierto que otras funciones que dependen del optimo funcionamiento de estas, van a verse secundariamente afectadas. Asi mismo, la literatura avala la asociacion de la gravedad de la afectacion cognitiva a la mayor presencia de sintomas negativos y a un peor desempeno social y laboral. El deficit cognitivo inherente a la enfermedad se ha podido observar tambien en familiares sanos de personas con esquizofrenia y en poblaciones de riesgo para desarrollar psicosis, por lo que determinados deficits cognitivos han sido conceptualizados como marcadores endofenotipicos de vulnerabilidad a la esquizofrenia. Una de las cuestiones aun sin resolver en relacion con el deterioro cognitivo en la esquizofrenia, es su evolucion a lo largo del desarrollo de la enfermedad, habiendose planteado como hipotesis alternativas, que su evolucion es estatica, o que sigue un curso de deterioro, lento, pero progresivo. Para tratar de responder a esta cuestion, se ha realizado un estudio de diseno transversal, con una muestra de 22 pacientes con una evolucion de la enfermedad entre uno y cinco anos, y 21 pacientes con diez o mas anos de evolucion de la enfermedad.",

Deficits have been reported to occur in symptomatic states (depression, [hypo]mania) as well as in remission, negatively impacting psychological well-being and impairing social and occupational functioning. Multiple studies have investigated the potential of pharmacological and nonpharmacological (psychological, behavioural and neurostimulatory) interventions for the amelioration or prevention of neurocognitive impairments. In this chapter, we present an overview of these approaches. We focus particularly on their underlying mechanisms of action and discuss the relative advantages of each approach.",

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

In der Beurteilung bei speziellen Krankheitsbildern ist immer vom Einzelfall auszugehen. Von einer Einschränkung der FE ist auszugehen, wenn eine Verkehrsgefährdung durch die Erkrankung/Symptomatik in konkreten Fahrsituationen anzunehmen ist, sodass ein Unfall mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eintreten kann. Derartige Gefährdungssituationen entstehen durch Einschränkungen der körperlichen oder geistigen Leistungsfähigkeit, unvorhersehbar auftretende Störungen der Leistungsfähigkeit oder mangelnde Einsicht in Gefahren und Risiken. Die Bedingungen bei verschiedenen Krankheitsbildern/Syndromen werden diskutiert.

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status.

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

Sa(思) is a major cognitive activity, and the other six emotions are main emotional activities. The emphasis on the interrelationship between cognition, sentiment, and emotional activity is a unique characteristic of the Jeongji(情志) concept in China. Jeongji[Mental] disorder refers to a series of diseases that has a close link between the attack, clinical presentation and emotional stimulation. The attack is deeply affected by emotional stimulation, with which physical symptoms are either present or absent. However, emotional changes are clear most of the time, their effect on disease development noticeable as well. To sum up, Jeongji[Mental] disorder is related to a wide range of medical problems in fields such as internal, surgical, gynecology, pediatrics, and various psychiatric disorders, not to mention contemporary psychological disorders, neurosis, and all kinds of mental illnesses of today. Moreover, the mental and physical disorders of today all share a common pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and treatment discipline. All the more reason for deeper professional research.",

Depending on the magnitude and localization, this may have relatively mild consequences (such as a learning deficit) or major consequences (such as developmental delay, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or death). We are interested in selective or regional neuron death because they can help to explain the neurologic dysfunction experienced by an individual or give insight into the pathologic process that preceded death.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

El síntoma cardinal de la fibromialgia es el dolor, cuya hipótesis reside en la neuropatogenia, que se basa en la disminución del umbral del dolor y disfunción de los receptores de los neurotransmisores y vías encargadas de procesarlo. Las manifestaciones clínicas neuropsiquiátricas se corresponden a las distintas disfunciones a nivel de la corteza y nervios periféricos. En el sistema nervioso central se producen alteraciones de las funciones cognitivas, cefalea y fatiga mental; mientras que en el sistema nervioso periférico se produce el dolor de tipo neuropático y otros trastornos en la sensibilidad, a causa de la disminución del umbral del dolor.

      "abstract": "The term of a considerable damage to one's health is central in German guardianship law with respect to judge's decisions on involuntary commitment and coercive treatment. A legal definition has not been provided, and up to now no explanations from the part of medicine have been available what a considerable damage to one's health is in the case of mental illness and how it can be determined. A consensus paper of the German Association of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (DGPPN) explains four possible scenarios of manifestation of such kind of damage, corresponding to somatic illnesses: evidence of structural brain lesions (rare), subjective suffering (sufficient, but not necessary), impairment of functioning in important areas of life, and severe impairment of social participation (e. g. by dangerous behaviour against others). This view corresponds with the WHO's bio-psycho-social concept of health.",

      "title": "Sensory and Perceptual Alterations",
      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

The second type of request is for assessment of psychiatric symptoms in the context of a known neurological disorder. The third type of request is when patients develop prominent psychiatric symptoms but there is concern that these are the product of an underlying neurological process. Psychiatric symptoms are also very common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and take the form of depression, agitation, anxiety and irritability.

      "abstract": "The catastrophic reaction (CR; a disruptive and uncontrolled behavior triggered by anger, irritability, and hostility) and emotionalism (a condition of uncontrolled crying or laughing) are disorders of the emotional regulation and expression, the prevalence of which is underestimated in neurology. Their occurrence is an additional factor of poor outcome for neurologic patients. Although they have been recognized and completely described in their clinical manifestations more than a century ago, many issues remain unsolved regarding their pathogenesis and the respective role of the brain damage and psychological factors. Thus, if pathological crying and laughing can be linked to one or more lesions within the corticospinal tracts, the emotional lability and CR have uncertain connections within specific functional brain systems and seem to be influenced by personality factors or depression and anxiety generated by coping with a serious neurological disease. These epistemological difficulties are also the consequence of some methodological limits of the questionnaires and scales, which diagnose these disorders and for which the cut-off values between the normal and pathological condition could be questioned. Thus, their assessment requires new psychophysical. The CR and emotionalism manifest in association with several different neurological disease (degenerative, vascular, inflammatory, epilepsy) and psychiatric conditions as psychosis, mania, and mood disorders. Across these different diseases, the findings of common patterns of lesion location, cognitive dysfunction, emotional changes, and behavioral responses to new paradigms might clarify the pathogenesis and orient the treatment.",

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

Agents capable of precipitating dissociative-like states include alcohol, barbiturates and similarly acting hypnotics, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, clioquinol, β-adrenergic blockers, marijuana and certain psychedelic drugs, general anesthetics, and others. The presentations of substance-induced dissociative states may resemble those of functional dissociative disorders, or organic and psychogenic dissociative factors may coexist and be intertwined or indistinguishable. Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology. Substance-induced and other organic dissociative disorders can have clinical, medicolegal, and neuropsychological significance. They provide a unique opportunity for the study of mind-brain relationships and should be included in psychiatric nosology.",

      "title": "New symptoms in a patient with diagnosed porphyria – untypical clinical course or another disease? Extended differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Acute liver porphyrias are caused by mutations of genes encoding the heme biosynthesis enzymes. A lack of any of these enzymes leads to a decrease in the heme level, which in each case is manifested by identical clinical symptoms. Nervous tissue is particularly susceptible to a depletion of heme levels. Three classical symptoms of a porphyria attack include: abdominal pain (as a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy), peripheral neuropathy, and psychic disturbances. Apart from the main symptoms, porphyria attacks may be manifested as various neurological disturbances, such as: bulbar palsy, epileptic seizures, psychic disturbances and focal symptoms of CNS damage. The intensity of individual symptoms can vary. Although neurological symptoms usually disappear after the attack, they may cause permanent deficits. Through involving CNS, porphyria can mimic other neurological disorders. Damage to the nervous system can be confirmed by additional examinations. Thus far, disseminated focal changes during the attack, which disappear after the regression of clinical symptoms, have been described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Spinal cord abnormalities in MRI scans have not been described yet, despite the fact that damage to the anterior horn associated with porphyria has been confirmed in literature. While examining cerebrospinal fluid during the attack, an elevated protein level has been noticed, so far without the presence of oligoclonal bands. This paper aimed to demonstrate that porphyria should be considered in differential diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper is based on the case of a symptomatic patient who carried a mutation in one of the genes for porphyria, and who developed a clinical manifestation of focal damage to CNS. A differential diagnosis of porphyria and CIS, with a subsequent conversion to a clinically defined MS, was carried out. The results of additional examinations performed routinely in both disorders, the clinical picture and data from medical literature have been used in the analysis of this case. The authors present the case of a patient with confirmed genetic porphyria, who was hospitalized for purposes of establishing a diagnosis due to weakened lower extremities. The patient manifested spastic lower extremity paresis, sensation disorders and urinary incontinence, which indicated spinal cord damages. An MRI scan of the thoracic spine revealed disseminated foci with contrast enhancement. A high level of proteins and oligoclonal bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the basis of a new clinical picture (differing from the previous attack symptoms), prolonged symptoms, spinal cord lesions in MRI, and the presence of oligoclonal bands, CIS was diagnosed. Quick and complete recovery was obtained due to the administering of a steroid therapy. After several months, the patient reported a similar, passing episode, which, according to the authors, confirmed the diagnosis and an expected conversion to a clinically defined MS. Taking into consideration the clinical manifestation of spinal cord involvement untypical of porphyria, the detection of spinal lesions in an MRI scan, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and the positive effect of steroid therapy, the authors believe that this described patient, who was a symptomatic carrier of a mutation in a gene for porphyria, developed CIS. This reported case, supported by data from medical literature, shows that porphyria should be taken into consideration in any differential diagnosis of CIS and MS.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms causing great personal distress and impairing social and occupational function. The societal burden from anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms of all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis on identification of the specific features of particular disorders. Need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, level of associated disability, impact on everyday life, presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatments. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics and patient and doctor preferences. There is much overlap between different anxiety disorders in evidence-based and effective therapies (e.g. prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or course of cognitive behavioural therapy), but there are important differences. It thus helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Conversion disorder has one or more symptoms that affect voluntary motor or sensory function suggesting a neurological or other medical condition, but they are inconsistent with known neurological or musculoskeletal pathologies. Individuals with conversion disorder do not intentionally produce or feign their symptoms. Instead, the symptoms are due to an unconscious expression of a psychological conflict or need. There might be associated primary and secondary gains which act as maintaining factors. The disorder is more common in adolescence than in childhood. CASE REPORT: A 17 years old male reported to the Emergency Department alleged history of fall from a 10 feet wall c/o neck pain, inability to move all 4 limbs, diminished sensation below the neck. Cervical immobilization was done and his vitals & routine blood investigations were found to be normal. No signs of any urinary retention or fecal incontinence. Routine neurological examination was performed which revealed hypotonia in all 4 limbs with flaccidity with a power of 0/5 and diminished sensation at the level of C3. Neuro imaging was done. MRI brain with cervical screening revealed no edema, cord compression. MRI CERVICAL SPINE – NORMAL. Stressor: He was convicted under POSCO act for 3 years, 2 days before the incident. Neurosurgeon ruled out the physical cause of the above presentation. Detailed history revealed he was being convicted for 3 years for a marrying a 17 years old girl with her consent under POSCO act 2 days prior to the incident. He was seen distressed after hearing the verdict, had sleep disturbances, remained aloof, not communicating with others. He attempted suicide by jumping from the wall. He had a history of occasional cannabis use for the past 2 years. Family history revealing possession attacks in his mother. He was raised by a single parent as his father left him and his mother when he was 5 years old. He had no episodes of similar illness in the past. His temperament revealed that he had difficulty in adjustment to the situations being impulsive and had self-injurious behavior. Mental status examination revealed that the patient was lying in supine position, not able to move his all 4 limbs with obvious psychomotor retardation decreased talks, sad mood. DISCUSSION: The clinical picture is indicative of Dissociative Motor Disorder F44.4 according to ICD 10. After taking a detailed history, it was clear that he was extremely distressed regarding his punishment under POSCO act as he willfully married a 17 years old girl with her consent which could not stand in the court of law. Patient was started on therapy sessions as well as low-dose diazepam. In the sessions, possible causes of these symptoms were discussed, his family members were also psycho-educated about the psychosomatic nature of the symptoms and advised to encourage him for a symptom-free lifestyle. They were also given an instruction not to pay attention to his complaints of physical nature. Psychotherapy sessions were started in which all her stressors were therapy discussed. CONCLUSION: Conversion disorder, somatoform disorder, and malingering always remain a diagnostic challenge for the clinicians. The prompt history taking, identification of stressors, use of appropriate and validated physical examination manoeuvres, and coordination of care and information exchange between all family members and medical team may facilitate the expeditious care of these patients in a cost-effective manner. Psychogenic symptoms should be treated using suggestions, patience, and reassurance. Early recognition of a conversion disorder will limit unnecessary tests and medications. The quality of doctor-patient relationship can influence outcome. The existing literature supports a multidisciplinary treatment approach, with specific interventions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy for cognitive restructuring and psychodynamic therapy for addressing symptom connections to trauma and dissociation.",

      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "title": "Postoperative Delirium",
      "abstract": "NETWORKS are central to life, a fact that becomes strikingly apparent when they become dysfunctional. We have all experienced a sense of frustration when the “net is down” or when trapped in an airport because some critical hub in another city has been debilitated by an unexpected snowstorm. Even seemingly minor disruptions in the transfer of information or people can lead to a surprising degree of disorganization. However, these relatively inconsequential annoyances of modern life pale in comparison with faltering or failing brain networks. Aberrant structural and/or functional connections across the brain account for numerous neurological conditions (such as apraxia or agraphia)1 and have been hypothesized to mediate more complex cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia.2 So why should a clinical anesthesiologist care about a neurologic or psychiatric “disconnection syndrome?” The answer is found in this issue of Anesthesiology, where van Dellen et al.3 present evidence to suggest that postoperative delirium is associated with abnormal patterns of functional and directional connectivity in the brain.Delirium is an acute cognitive disorder, which is typically characterized by a fluctuating course, inattention, disordered thinking, and altered level of consciousness.4 With a reported incidence between 5 and 70% in patients older than 65 yr after various major surgeries,5,6 delirium is arguably the most common neurologic complication of major surgery. Despite this, the pathophysiology of delirium is poorly understood.7 Importantly, postoperative delirium is associated with increased morbidity, longer hospital or intensive care unit stay, cognitive decline, quality-of-life decrement, and death.5,8–10 Patients with delirium can be hyperactive and agitated or hypoactive and lethargic. Interestingly, the hypoactive motor subtype is more common, is often undiagnosed, and has been associated with worse outcomes.11 In short, delirium is a pathophysiologically obscure, underdiagnosed, common, and serious neurological complication of surgery. The field of anesthesiology should therefore prioritize its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, while concurrently investigating its underlying mechanisms.In the current study, van Dellen et al. conducted a postoperative assessment of patients aged 50 yr or older undergoing cardiac surgery who had no history of neurologic or psychiatric disease. Mental status was evaluated during a 5-day period after surgery (or after emerging from postoperative coma) using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit, a validated instrument for diagnosing delirium in intubated intensive care unit patients.12 In addition, 21-channel electroencephalography was recorded in the postoperative period and later analyzed for functional connectivity, directional connectivity, and various network features (table 1). Clinical characteristics and connectivity and network measures were compared between patients with delirium and a matched cohort without delirium. The investigators found that, not surprisingly, patients with delirium (n = 25) were sicker and had longer surgical times compared with patients without delirium (n = 24). However, even controlling for these factors, there was a reduction of functional connectivity in the α bandwidth (8 to 13 Hz) and increased directional connectivity from central to anterior regions in the δ bandwidth (0.5 to 4 Hz). Furthermore, a number of network properties (such as path length and clustering coefficient) were abnormal in patients who experienced delirium. The authors concluded that functional brain networks are less connected in association with postoperative delirium, suggesting that mechanistically it may be classified as a disconnection syndrome.Before interpreting these results, it will be beneficial to consider some methodological points. There are four types of “connectivity” that are often measured in the brain: (1) structural, defined as the anatomic connections between brain regions, (2) functional, defined as the statistical covariations between the activity of brain regions, (3) directional, defined as coupled activity in which one brain region leads and another follows or lags (without, necessarily, having a causal influence), and (4) effective, defined as a causal relationship in which one brain region is influencing the activity of another. One well-known problem with measures of functional connectivity using electroencephalography is volume conduction. If the same source of activity is detected at two different electrodes, that activity artificially appears to be synchronized or coherent because it is merely common to both electrodes. To avoid this problem, Stam13 (an author of the current study) and colleagues previously introduced phase lag index (PLI) as a measure of functional connectivity. PLI attempts to bypass the volume conduction problem by not “counting” zero-lag correlations (which, because there is no phase difference, could potentially come from the same source). Instead, PLI assesses consistent, nonzero phase lead–lag relationships that presumably reflect a functional connection between two sources of activity. Unlike this snapshot measure of instantaneous phase relationship, directed PLI (dPLI) is a measure of directional connectivity that assesses lead–lag relationships over time. dPLI has been studied in a neuroanatomically informed brain model and shows a tendency of α rhythm “flow” from anterior to posterior brain structures in the resting state,14 which has been confirmed empirically in human volunteers.15van Dellen et al. used PLI and dPLI in the current study. This means that their results regarding functional connectivity might be less likely to reflect volume conduction and also means that the findings may reflect longer-range connections in the brain (which would tend to have nonzero lag relationships). Of note, Lee et al. previously studied PLI and dPLI after induction with propofol, finding reduced PLI in the α bandwidth (8 to 13 Hz) during and after the period of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Furthermore, the abnormal dPLI may reflect changes in the topology of the network, as has also been suggested by the study of dPLI and propofol (although in the α rather than δ bandwidth).15 In light of the current findings, it might be speculated that postoperative delirium reflects a failed recovery—or perhaps a fragile recovery—of functional connectivity, as manifested in the α bandwidth. This functional “disconnection” could prevent individual subsystems in the brain from properly interacting and integrating information, resulting in the cognitive deficits characteristic of delirium. Furthermore, electroencephalographic measures of connectivity may have diagnostic potential, especially in the case of hypoactive delirium when the phenotype is not clinically obvious.There are a number of important points to consider before including postoperative delirium in the class of disconnection syndromes. First, a prior study of functional magnetic resonance imaging and delirium demonstrated an increase in functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, with decreases between cortical and subcortical structures.16 These data need to be reconciled with the electroencephalographic study by van Dellen et al., who found reduced corticocortical connectivity. Second, the differences in functional connectivity between the cohorts with and without delirium were small (PLI of 0.119 vs. 0.139). It is unclear what clinical meaning these statistically significant differences have in relation to overall network function, or whether they could be explained by more mundane reasons related to the processing of the electroencephalographic data. Third, unlike the past study of functional magnetic resonance imaging, this was not a within-subjects study design. In other words, we do not have data on individual subjects in periods of both lucidity and cognitive dysfunction and therefore cannot distinguish if the changes in functional connectivity are associated with delirium or some other brain property of these generally sicker patients. Finally, delirium has a complex etiology, so any potential relationship between the cognitive disconnections during anesthetic-induced unconsciousness15,17 and those of the postoperative period is merely speculative.Despite these limitations, it should be noted that the work by van Dellen et al. is the first to probe the electroencephalogram of patients with postoperative delirium beyond its spectral properties, pointing to the potential for functional disconnections and network abnormalities as the mechanism for disrupted cognition. Further work is required to reconcile these results with past investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging and to establish robust connectivity measures that might reveal when the network is down.The authors are not supported by, nor maintain any financial interest in, any commercial activity that may be associated with the topic of this article.",

      "abstract": "#### Summary points\n\nNeuropathic pain arises from damage, or pathological change, in the peripheral or central nervous system. It is usually a chronic condition that can be difficult to treat because standard treatment with conventional analgesics does not typically provide effective relief of pain. Patients with neuropathic pain commonly present to primary care professionals, but making a diagnosis may be difficult. Neuropathic pain is usually associated with substantially greater impairment of quality of life compared with other types of chronic pain, and the disorder is a large cost burden on healthcare services. In this review, we provide an overview of published evidence to help clinicians recognise and manage patients with neuropathic pain.\n\nA group of specialists of the International Association for the Study of Pain defines neuropathic pain as “pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.”1 In contrast to inflammatory or nociceptive pain, which is caused by actual tissue damage or potentially tissue damaging stimuli, neuropathic pain is produced either by damage to, or pathological change in, the peripheral or central nervous system, the system that normally signals pain. As such, the term neuropathic pain represents a varying set of symptoms rather than a single diagnosis.\n\nDamage to the somatosensory system can provoke a range of responses; an absence of sensation and pain is probably a more common response than new onset of …",

      "abstract": "Functional weakness and sensory loss are common clinical problems with variable presentations. Functional weakness commonly presents as weakness of an entire limb, paraparesis, or hemiparesis, with observable or demonstrable inconsistencies and nonanatomic accompaniments. Documentation of limb movements during sleep, the arm drop test, the Babinski thigh-trunk test, Hoover tests, the Sonoo abductor test, and various dynamometer tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional weakness. Functional sensory loss typically affects all sensory modalities, either in a hemisensory distribution or affecting an entire limb. Although often inconsistent over serial examinations with nonanatomic features, many clinical findings reported to be helpful in diagnosing functional sensory loss are neither sensitive nor specific for functional sensory loss. The yes-no test, Bowlus-Currier test, and forced-choice tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional sensory loss. Clinicians must be prepared to make more than one diagnosis in some cases, including an organic neurological diagnosis and a diagnosis of functional overlay. Recent studies have reported relatively low rates (<5%) of misdiagnosis of functional weakness or sensory loss as indicated by subsequent diagnosis of neurological or psychiatric conditions that explained the presenting symptoms. Most neurologists find such patients more difficult to help than patients with organic disease. Management focuses on supportive psychotherapy and behavioral management, exploration of social and psychological issues, treatment of comorbid depression or anxiety, and facilitation of development of more appropriate and constructive coping methods. Many patients with functional weakness, and to a somewhat lesser extent functional sensory loss, have persisting or relapsing-remitting somatic symptoms and persistently impaired social/interpersonal, occupational, and psychological functioning.",

Further, consciousness of actions (voluntariness) and consciousness of motives (intentionality) are not necessarily associated. Illness behavior can be learned and reinforced and is a potential confounder in the association between illness or injury and impairment or disability. Illness behavior is not an impairing condition according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), and a table in the article describes the characteristics of the symptom magnification syndrome and other related conditions. Three diagnoses—somatic symptom disorders, illness anxiety disorder, and conversion disorder—possibly are ratable using the AMA Guides . Unsupported and insupportable conclusions regarding symptom exaggeration represent substandard practice because of the importance of such conclusions to the disposition of patients who present for assessment of impairment or disability. Similarly, failure to note and account for illness behavior and symptom exaggeration also represent substandard practice because the goal in impairment ratings is to note and account for all evidence related to the impairment, including the extent of illness behaviors.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of functional neurological disorder (FND) has rested traditionally on two key features: inconsistency and incongruency. Inconsistency usually refers to inconsistency between movement, sensory or cognitive performance in a voluntary versus an 'automatic' scenario. This is the principle of Hoover's sign of functional leg weakness, the tremor entrainment test for functional tremor and a range of cognitive tests in functional cognitive disorder. It is often helpful to share these tests with patients as they show the potential for improvement, give an insight into the 'software' mechanism of FND in the brain and also feed into a range of FND-specific therapies. For example, a physiotherapist might actively use distraction to promote automatic movement and discourage overlearned abnormal patterns of voluntary movement. Incongruency, on the other hand, refers to a clinical feature that is not present in other superficially similar neurological conditions, or that apparently violates laws of anatomy, biology or physics. I have always struggled with incongruency in FND but now am breaking my silence, assisted by the intriguing case of a patient with 'functional freezing of gait' from Jorik Nonnekes and colleagues in this issue of Practical Neurology .1 The patient described in the paper and accompanying video has a functional gait disorder. But is it reasonable, as the authors suggest, to make that diagnosis, in part, because it does not look like another disorder, principally Parkinsonism, with which we are more familiar? In my view, incongruence needs retirement. It should be sent to the FND section of the neuromythology graveyard where it can join 'la belle indifférence',2 'non-organic'3 and the universal application of 'conversion disorder'.4 Here is what I object to, and find incongruent, about this sign still being used in the clinical assessment of FND (box 1).

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "title": "Factors Associated with Outcome in Extremity Surgery",
      "abstract": "Musculoskeletal diseases can heavily influence a patient’s life due to their inherit impact on ability/capability. Ability/Activity/capability is defined by The World Health Organization (WHO), as a multilayered concept that involves a dynamic interaction between body functions and structures, health conditions (disorders or disease), ability to participate, environmental factors and personal factors. Lack of capability due to a musculoskeletal injury or illness can result in reduced mobility, independence and quality of life. Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are used to quantify symptom intensity and magnitude of activity intolerance (i.e. ability/capability/disability ). Considerable variation exists in both PROMS and the subjective experience of musculoskeletal diseases. A great portion of this variation is explained by mental health (psychological distress, cognitive bias [misconceptions] regarding pain) and social health, rather than objectifiable measures such as radiographs. While negative thoughts, misconceptions and a lacking support system can influence capability negatively, strong social support, days full of meaning, purpose and structure, a hopeful and curious mindset, and healthy thoughts/coping mechanisms, help people manage adversity and will help them adapt and build resiliency. Patients seeking care want to be helped, people with impairments want to be understood. For clinicians seeking to aid their patients on the road to recovery it is important to understand what factors drive the very questions patients came to visit them with. Patients are more than just their symptoms, objectified by the biomedical measures of illness, they are influenced by the entire paradigm of biomedical, psychological and social factors.",

Unmada is classified into five (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, sannipataja and agantuja) types, and \"Vataja Unmada\" (VU) is one among them. The description of VU is available in all major Ayurvedic classical texts, and it comes under \"Doshaja\" (psychiatric disorder which occurs due to the aggravation of doshas) category. Studies or scientific literature on VU has been lacking, and the present work is focused on to explore this condition. The etiopathology of VU denotes deficiency of various nutritional factors such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3-fatty acids, amino acids, and antioxidants. Lacking or deficiency of these nutritional factors leads to structural and/or functional damage and degeneration of the brain (neurodegenerative or demyelinating pathology) which ultimately leads to the manifestation of different degenerative psychiatric disorders. The clinical picture of VU resembles various psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions such as \"disorganized schizophrenia\" or \"hebephrenia\" or \"catatonia\" or \"dementia\" or \"bipolar disorder with psychotic features\" or \"mania with psychotic features,\" or \"organic or secondary psychoses.\" VU is a treatable condition, and it can be managed successfully by \"Panchakarma\" procedures along with internal medicines.",

Evidence suggests that these comorbidities may be explained by a limited capacity of individuals to exert cognitive control on thoughts, emotions, or behaviors. A decrease of this capacity of control could contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain and its associated symptoms. Benefits of the cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of chronic pain may be explained by learning efficient and less costly pain coping strategies in terms of cognitive control capacity.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "title": "CS03-04 - Concept of somatoform disorder",
      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "abstract": "Psychic activity relies on the physiological processes occurring in the brain. When disruptive factors, such as alcohol consumption or hallucinogenic substances intervene, the product of nervous activity, known as the psyche, becomes disturbed, resulting in perception, thought, and behavioral disorders. The psyche can be considered a fascinating mechanism oscillating between extremes: it can be both objective and subjective; both material and ideal. Additionally, the psyche manifests itself both normally and pathologically. Regarding the ways the psyche manifests, distinct categories can be identified. Appropriate behavior exhibited by individuals defines the normal psyche, while the pathological psyche exhibits unusual behavioral disorders often deemed immoral. The term \"normality\" is ambiguous and encompasses several meanings:It can refer to a person's discernment in psychiatric expert evaluations for judicial purposes; It can be associated broadly with individual health; It represents physical, mental, and social well-being; Psychiatrically, it is defined by the absence of mental illness. Medico-legal psychiatric examinations play a crucial role in justice, providing data to assess the responsibility of individuals who have committed criminal acts. To promote ethical principles and lawful conduct, preventive and intervention measures must be devised for cases involving antisocial defiance and social maladaptation. The pathological psyche is characterized by biological and/or psycho-behavioral changes that cause distress, disability, or a high risk of such outcomes (according to the American Psychiatric Association, 1994).",

      "title": "Medically unexplained physical symptoms",
      "abstract": "Concern about physical symptoms is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Many of these symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue, remain unexplained by identi­fiable disease even after careful medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe these types of symptom— somatoform, medically un­explained, and functional. We prefer the terms ‘med­ically unexplained physical symptom’ or ‘functional symptom’, because they imply a disturbance of some kind in bodily functioning without implying that the symptom is psychogenic. Patients and doctors often assume that a physical symptom implies that a phys­ical pathology exists. However, commonly experienced and often severe, distressing, and disabling symp­toms, such as menstrual pain or ‘tension headache’, indicate that this is not always the case. By assuming that a physical symptom is explained by physical dis­ease/ pathology, we may be subjecting the patient to unnecessary tests and hospital visits, adding to pa­tient distress, and failing to deliver the integrated management required. There are many kinds of these symptoms (Box 25.1), presenting across healthcare settings. They are con­sidered in this psychiatry textbook because (1) psy­chological factors (including, at times, psychiatric disorder) are important in aetiology and (2) psycho­logical and behavioural interventions have a funda­mental role in treatment A major obstacle to effective management of pa­tients with functional symptoms is that they feel their doctor does not believe them. They are concerned that they may be thought to be ‘putting it on’. Note that the deliberate manufacture or exaggeration of symptoms or signs (malingering) is quite different (see p. 359). Diagnoses of three kinds may be given: … ● Descriptive physical syndromes. These include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, non- cardiac chest pain, chronic pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the specific terms are useful in everyday medical practice, there is substantial overlap, and many patients with, for example, fibromyalgia will also have IBS. ● Psychiatric syndromes as the primary cause of the functional symptoms. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and adjustment, are common primary causes of functional symptoms, and commonly present via the general hospital’s emergency department or cardiology clinic.",

      "title": "Psychodiagnostics as a mandatory element of patient protocols in dentistry",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The psycho-emotional status of patients requiring dental treatment is severely affected by constant stress.[1] Stress is associated with visible or perceived defects that disrupt the patient's image: difficulties in articulating words during chewing or communicating with other people. The severity of such a stressful condition depends on several factors. Among these are the type of nervous activity, characteristics of the patient's perception of their image, social environment and social reaction to the patient's appearance, patient's assessment of their own condition, and the dentist's attitude toward the patient's psycho-emotional state.[2] Many unsuccessful dental interventions occur primarily due to the negative emotional mood of patients; however, they also deal with the discomfort that they experience both during and after the dental procedure. That is exacerbated by increasing stress, anxiety, and psycho-emotional tension or exhaustion, diminishing the positive effect of dental treatment.[3] Further, numerous research works observed possible changes in the normal functioning of the patient's body, namely, in pulse, blood pressure, and heart rate values.[456] These are visible in the results of studies when the ECG was performed during dental surgery.[7] Such deviations might also have the opposite effect. Thus, psycho-emotional stress leads to a delay in the grafting process. Changes in the nervous and endocrine systems can cause certain disturbances in the hemostatic system.[8] High emotional tension is also known to cause a specific contraction of the skeletal musculature of the face, which results in a manifestation of a local vascular response.[9] Another psycho-emotional trait that characterizes patients with dental problems is the anticipation of pain far before the start of the surgery. Some particularly sensitive patients can experience serious emotional trauma, even during simple dental procedures such as dental extraction. Fear can occur at the anesthesia stage, and the patient's body is then characterized by an increase in energy expenditure, which exceeds energy production. Psycho-emotional stress results in a 17% increase in oxygen consumption on average, triggering anaerobic glycolysis. This process, in turn, is a precursor to acidosis, leading to tissue hypoxia and a delayed reparation process. Increased anxiety is the cause of maladaptation and the appearance of neuropsychic disorders, as well as a slower recovery rate after surgery.[10] Psychodiagnosis is, thus, a necessary element of dental treatment. The use of dental questionnaires contributes to the selection of appropriate tactics for interaction between the physician and the patient. In this case, the questionnaires both before and after patients' dental treatment appear necessary. Comparing the results of the pretreatment and posttreatment questionnaire provides good insights into the effectiveness of dental treatment. As there are relatively few studies of this type to date, it appears necessary and relevant to conduct them. In order to adequately assess patient satisfaction with the quality of dental care provided, specialized questionnaires may be helpful, in addition to traditional methods of psycho-emotional analysis.[11] They contain dental questions that are relevant to both the dentist and the patient.[12] Once these questionnaires have been analyzed, the right tactics for patient rehabilitation can be selected.[13] A logical construction of such an analysis is the study of changes in the values of indicators of the patient's psychological state both before and after dental intervention.[14] Such an analysis is a reliable measure of the effectiveness and quality of dental care provided.[1516] Further, these studies appear necessary as they may contribute to the improvement of dental service quality. This study aims at performing a comparative analysis of the psycho-emotional condition of patients both before and after dental surgery. The objectives of the study were: (a) to examine the psycho-emotional state of patients with removable constructions; (b) similarly, to examine the state of patients with fixed constructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS MATERIALS The study was conducted in the Russian Federation in 2019–2020; it addressed data on patients from three dental clinics (two clinics from the Moscow city [Dental Clinic No. 62 of the Moscow City Health Department and Dental Clinic No. 12 of the Moscow City Health Department] and one clinic from the Perm city [City Dental Clinic No. 1]). The study involved a total of 600 patients divided into three groups. The patients' age ranged from 22 to 63 years, with a mean age of 42.0 ± 5.5 years. The average age and the number of men and women in each group are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Gender composition and average age of patients in the three groupsThe number of men and women in each group was similar (P ≥ 0.05; Table 1). The age of patients within each group and between groups also had no significant differences. The first group consisted of 200 patients with fixed dentures (metal-ceramic, used up to 3 years); the second group included patients with removable devices (200 patients); and the control group comprised 200 patients with healthy teeth. The dental procedures were provided under local anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN The Fere method was applied to estimate the predominant activity of the hemispheres. A scheme included three components: a current source and its amplifier (15 mAm) + silver electrodes (S = 2 cm2) + ohmmeter. Parameters of this skin-galvanic reaction were taken from two fingers of the right and left hands. Parameters on different hands were measured separately, first on the left hand and then on the right hand. Low resistance values at the moment of data acquisition allowed concluding the right hemisphere dominance in the patient's mental and emotional spheres and the corresponding emotional manifestations, namely, aggression, negative emotions, and increased anxiety. On the left side, the same data indicated the dominance of the left hemisphere with the corresponding emotions—satisfaction and positive emotions. Afterward, a bilateral asymmetry of hemispheric activity was calculated, when the left-hand indicators were divided by the right-hand indicators. The index value equaling to one was considered to be a physiological norm. Thus, the activity of the hemispheres was balanced. This study was conducted following international ethical and moral standards (the Helsinki Declaration of 1975). When working with patients, their written consent to data processing was obtained. Anonymity and confidentiality of information were preserved. RESEARCH METHODS Levels of anxiety and pain were determined by using a questionnaire. For this purpose, a generally accepted scale of patients' self-assessment of anxiety by Spielberger and Hanin and a Universal Pain Assessment Tool were applied. This test adequately reflects personal and reactive anxiety, estimating it as a constant characteristic of a personality. The advantage of the test is its validity and informativeness in the self-assessment of anxiety levels. The test includes two blocks corresponding to the level of reactive (questions 1 to 20) and personal (questions 21 to 40) anxiety. Reactive anxiety was calculated following the formula P = (A1 − A2) + 50, where A1 is the sum of 3–4, 6–7, 9, 12–14, and 18 items of the anxiety level scale, and A2 is the sum of items 1–2, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 19–20. Similarly, the level of personal anxiety was calculated using the formula L = (A1 − A2) + 35, in which A1 corresponds to the sum of items from questions 22 to 25 inclusive, questions 28 and 29, 31 and 32, also questions 34 and 35, questions 37 to 39 inclusive, and A2 is the sum of items from the remaining questions. Pain level was interpreted on a scale from 0 to 10 or by monitoring the patient's behavior. Each patient also filled out a questionnaire designed to express their opinion about the quality of dental treatment received. The questionnaire included questions on the patient's assessment of their teeth condition and their opinion on how the treatment affected their health and various aspects of life. The list of questions also included social aspects of the patient's life and, from the patient's point of view, the necessity and obligation of visiting the dentist. RESEARCH ALGORITHM The study was performed in the following way. First, a testing of Fere's skin-galvanic reaction was performed. Then, each of the patients filled out a quality-of-life questionnaire developed by the authors. Pain assessment was performed during the dental procedure under local anesthesia. Afterward, the skin-galvanic reaction readings were taken again, and the Spielberger-Hanin Scale questionnaire was administered. The Anxiety Scale questionnaire was offered once since in case of repeated completion, the patient may deliberately change the answers following his/her momentum opinion that the wrong answer was chosen at the beginning. The aim was to capture the possible relationship between questions about dental health and changes in anxiety levels. The algorithm allows establishing a clear psychodiagnostic of the patient's psychic state after the dental procedure, in particular, to reveal any changes in anxiety scores after the received therapy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data were processed using Statistica v. 6.0. A two-sample t-test for independent samples was used to detect the significance of differences. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. The distribution of features corresponded to normal, allowing for the establishment of Pearson's correlations. Tables 1–3 show arithmetic mean values for each parameter and the error of the mean.Table 2: Psychodiagnostics results of patients with healthy teeth (control group) before and after the survey about the condition of teethTable 3: Characteristics of psycho-emotional condition in patients from Group 1 (fixed metal-ceramic dentures) before and after evaluation of dental statusRESULTS For the control group, the asymmetry hemispheric activity index in 81 patients was within unity, which corresponded to a state of equilibrium. For another 69 patients, this index was less than unity, which corresponded to positive mood and the dominance of the left hemisphere. Finally, in 60 patients, the coefficient exceeded unity, which corresponded to dominance of the right hemisphere and negative emotional mood [Table 2]. In the control group, significant differences were established only for female patients. In both groups, with equilibrium and negative hemispheric activity index, the differences between the values before and after treatment were significant toward a 1.1-fold increase [Table 2]. The other indicators, particularly in the male group, did not differ from those in the control one. A direct correlation was established between the score in the dental status questionnaire and the emotions with which the patient filled out the questionnaire. This correlation was more pronounced in women (0.72; P ≤ 0.05) compared with men, namely, 0.72 vs. 0.57 at P ≤ 0.05, respectively. Consequently, the emotional state of the patients can influence the answers in the dental status questionnaire. There was also a direct correlation between the score growth in the questionnaire and the values of the hemispheric activity index after the survey, namely, 0.75 (P ≤ 0.05) for women and 0.64 (P ≤ 0.05) for men. Thus, the questions of the survey itself can have a significant influence on the patients' emotional state. At the same time, no statistically significant correlation between anxiety scores and the results of the dental status questionnaire were recorded for the control group. For patients from the second group with removable dentures, the hemispheric activity index corresponded to unity in 83 patients, that is, was equilibrium; in 48 patients, it was less than unity, that is, the left hemisphere and positive emotions dominated; and in the remaining 69 patients, the index exceeded unity, that is, the right hemisphere and negative emotions dominated. However, after a survey about dental health, the following changes were observed: 55 patients reported a state of equilibrium, 37 patients had positive emotional disposition, and the remaining 108 had a negative empathy. Significant changes were also obtained for the hemispheric activity index after the dental status survey, namely a 1.3-fold in men with the positive emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), a 2.2-fold in women with the negative emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), and a 2.1-fold in men from the same group (P ≤ 0.01). Also, a direct correlation between the increase of patients' questionnaire scores and their emotional state was recorded: 0.70 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.79 for men (P ≤ 0.05). These results indicate the influence of the patient's emotional state on the questionnaire results. After the survey, however, this relationship intensified in Group 2, and the correlation between the scores and hemispheric activity factor was 0.88 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.91 for men (P ≤ 0.05). In contrast to the control group, there was also a correlation between the anxiety level and score growth rates. Thus, for personal anxiety in men, the Pearson's correlation was 0.84 for both genders (P ≤ 0.05), whereas the reactive anxiety index amounted to 0.78 for women and 0.81 for men (P ≤ 0.05). The increasing level of anxiety indicates a negative influence of responses about dental treatment, which is also illustrated by the increasing number of patients with a negative emotional empathy in Group 2. Patients in Group 1 had a similar emotional state distribution compared with Group 2 before completing the dental status questionnaire. Thus, 87 had an equilibrium status with index values around unity, 68 were positive, and 43 were negative [Table 3]. After the patients answered the questions about dental health, the ratio of subgroups with different emotional moods changed in favor of the negative one. Hence, there were 80 people in an equilibrium state, 63 were positively inclined, and 57 had a negative emotional disposition [Table 3]. This indicates a tendency for the negative emotional mood to increase after the survey on dental status. Significant changes in the hemispheric activity coefficient both before and after treatment were noted for men with positive mood (a 1.1-fold increase, P ≤ 0.01), for women with negative mood (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05), and for men from the same group (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05). There was a direct correlation between the increased scores and emotional disposition among men and women in Group 1, namely 0.72 and 0.73, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Also, a correlation was established between the value of the hemispheric activity factor and the increased scores after the survey was recorded, namely, 0.82 for men and 0.81 for women (P ≤ 0.05). A correlation between an increase in the scores and the values of personal anxiety for men and women was 0.57 and 0.66, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). For reactive anxiety, these indices were 0.56 and 0.57 for men and women, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). As a result, patients in Groups 1 and 2 with removable and fixed dentures differ in anxiety levels. This confirms the hypothesis that the results of the dental health survey generally have a negative impact on the psycho-emotional status of the patient, especially when the local type of anesthesia is used. DISCUSSION This study showed that after the survey on dental status and quality of life was conducted, a significant increase in the hemispheric activity index values was noted among patients in the groups with removable and fixed dentures demonstrated. Hence, the emotional state of the patients changed toward the negative in both groups in general. These changes affected most patients with negative emotional mood prior to the administration of the questionnaire. There was also a dependence on the type of dentures. In Group 2 (with removable dentures), the increase in negative emotions was more pronounced, with the indices of anxiety varying more in male patients. Thus, the survey results can be used to perform a psychodiagnostic of the patient's emotional condition. If the patient scored up to 18 points on the survey, it can be stated that he or she is satisfied with the dental treatment provided. When the number of points ranges from 18.0 to 29.0, the patient can be considered as only partially satisfied with the quality of dental care provided. If a patient scores more than 29 points based on the test results, it can be assumed that they are not satisfied with the dental treatment performed. The behavioral response of patients under local anesthesia in the first group suggested a moderate level of pain. According to the results on the hemispheric activity index, the indicators of negative emotional mood worsened 1.2 times (P ≤ 0.05) for men and women in the group with fixed dentures; however, in the group with removable dentures, this tendency was stronger with 2.2 and 2.1 times, accordingly (P ≤ 0.01). These results are supported by the increased level of anxiety in patients with removable and fixed dentures. No emotional changes were found in any of the controls. The significance of differences between the groups according to the survey results was confirmed by statistical tests and established correlations between the emotional mood and the increase in scores. Among the study limitations, the factor of gender belonging (significant differences obtained for men and women) and the state of the patient's psyche should be particularly considered. In cases where the patient's mental condition may deviate from generally accepted norms (i.e., phobias), the test results may not adequately correspond to the patient's real psycho-emotional state. This was demonstrated in a study that evaluated the stress level of patients with epilepsy during dental procedures.[17] Data from questionnaires administered to 85 patients with epilepsy before elective dental surgery were considered. Dental anxiety was found in 17.6% of patients (n = 15). At the same time, dental anxiety did not correspond to factors such as age, level of education, type of epilepsy, frequency of attacks, use of antiepileptics, and many others. However, a significant correlation was found between gender (P < 0.01) and the type of oral surgery (removal of a retained third molar; P < 0.05) on the one hand and the level of dental anxiety on the other. Similar results were reported in other studies.[1819] A relationship to the gender factor was also established in this study. Results from this study are generally consistent with similar research. Thus, using data on 105 patients (aged 18–23 years) of dental clinics, it was found that different groups demonstrated various anxiety levels expressed in dentophobia and salivary pH changes.[20] Group 1 demonstrated a low level of anxiety and consisted of 33 patients (31.4%). Group 2 included 32 patients (30.5%) with moderate anxiety levels; however, in Group 2 with 40 patients (38.1%), a high anxiety level was recorded.[20] Of the 105 study participants, 85% showed low levels of dentophobia, 27% demonstrated low levels of anxiety, 29% showed moderate anxiety levels, and 28% showed high levels of anxiety. The mean salivary pH of all participants was 6.79 at rest and 6.43 in anxiety.[20] Thus, saliva pH may also be a factor worth considering in such studies. Another study showed that microcirculatory changes can indicate psycho-emotional stress development.[21] The study included 30 patients. The control group consisted of patients without psycho-emotional disorders but with postprosthetic complications after dental implantation. The results obtained showed that the capillary blood flow during stress changes at both oscillatory and nonoscillatory levels. At vasodilatation, an intensification of blood flow and disruption of venous flow was established. Analysis of high- and low-frequency oscillations by wavelet transformations revealed an increase in endothelium activity and a decrease in sympathetic adrenergic vasomotor and precapillary tone. Psycho-emotional stress is, therefore, mostly caused by a physiological factor. The patient's consciousness in dental clinic is a comprehensive relationship with the stimuli received from external and internal receptors. Through the interaction of these receptors, the consciousness forms a kind of emotional background, reflecting the patient's perception of the physical condition.[22232425] Besides, all of the patient's perceptions or experiences about their condition are reflected in the way they relate to their health.[26] In general, such patients can be divided into three groups: with a dismissive attitude, with an adequate attitude, and finally, the group with increased attention to their health.[16] Other data indicate that a negative emotional background is influenced by factors, such as the patient's intelligence, the intensity of pain, and the severity of the ongoing disease or upcoming dental procedure.[2728] Thus, research into the patient's emotional activity type plays an important role in subsequent dental treatment. The predominance of negative emotions, such as irritability, demandingness, and the frustration of their physical sensations, constitute a significant proportion among character traits, which also affect the patient's social life.[29] It is known that among the patients who have agreed to treatment, feelings of fear and pain may increase even before the dental treatment starts. Fear may take different, and often opposing, forms, such as worry, euphoria, and anxiety. Of the techniques used, two approaches are dominant.[22] The first approach is clinical, consisting of analytical conversations with the patient and observing behavioral patterns. The second approach is a laboratory one, which is less costly in time and resources and implies the use of questionnaires. The most commonly used questionnaires are the Eysenck questionnaire, the MMPI, and the MMPI 2. Further, the Eysenck questionnaire links types of temperament, extraversion and introversion, as well as stability and instability. However, most of the questionnaires show different deficiencies. Some of them diagnose a small number of psychoypes, others are too cumbersome, and many do not include psychometric properties. CONCLUSION This study showed that changes in the hemispheric activity index and indicators of personal and reactive anxiety are related to the survey results on the dental status and the type of dental service provided. By the quality-of-life criteria, the values obtained were different according to the emotional mood of the patient. It follows that obtaining reliable information about the patient's satisfaction with the dental care provided, questionnaires on the patient's dental health status are required in addition to the standard psychodiagnostic techniques. The study and analysis of the data obtained allow for the right choice to restore the patient's physical and mental health after receiving dental care. Such a multicomponent approach can greatly enhance the quality of dental treatments and establish the most efficient methods. These results are confirmed by the heightened level of anxiety in patients in groups with removable and fixed prostheses. No change of emotional mood was noted in controls.

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

This chapter describes the progression of ASD across the lifespan and how it differs from other neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and communication disorders. Children with ASD demonstrate early deviations from standard social development that persist across their lifespan. Nonverbal communicative behaviors such as eye gaze, imitation, and joint attention are regarded as foundational skills for the later development of more complex social behavior. The DSM-5 provides five additional specifiers that allow for the clustering of homogeneous subgroups. These five specifiers include: with or without accompanying intellectual impairment; with or without accompanying language impairment; associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor; associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder; and with catatonia.",

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

It therefore forms an important means of quantifying the NINCDS-AD RDA (McKhann et al., 1984) criteria for a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease, which require that there is impairment in memory functioning plus at least one other cognitive domain such as language, praxis, perceptual skills, problem-solving abilities, attention, or orientation, supported by the Folstein Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975), Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (BDRS) (Blessed et al., 1968), or a similar evaluation. These difficulties must interfere with everyday functional capacity. A diagnosis of possible Alzheimer’s disease is rendered when a patient presents with only a single progressive cognitive deficit, an atypical presentation, or when there is a medical or neuropsychiatric condition that might account for observed deficits but is not considered to be the cause of the dementia.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

This motor disturbance can be observed in a variety of clinical conditions, that can range from physiological NM, occurring when falling asleep or after prolonged exercise, to asterixis, a form of NM observed in patients with toxic-metabolic encephalopathies or with focal brain lesions, or, as a paroxysmal phenomenon, labelled as epileptic negative myoclonus, in epileptic patients. Neurophysiological investigations are essential to diagnose NM and to distinguish it from other motor disorders, such as tremor or positive myoclonus. Furthermore, neurophysiological findings can provide useful information supporting a subcortical or cortical origin of NM. In cortical NM, recent data suggest a role of cortical active inhibitory areas in the generation of this motor phenomenon.",

Such outcomes are considered potentially more sensitive and specific to important therapeutic effects, and may be more linked to disability and disease-related life losses than conventional assessments of impairment (e.g. ability to walk, performance on language tests, serological or radiological indices). Self-report is invaluable to identify social and emotional consequences of brain injury: depression, changes in intimate and family relationships, social role and community participation losses. However, common stroke-related neuropsychological deficits are likely to confound subjective stroke outcome measures. The scientific community focused on stroke-related health outcomes may arrive at {significantly underestimated} patient reports of stroke-related disability, caused by a failure to adjust for the effect on self-report of spatial neglect, deficits of magnitude estimation, pathologic alteration of self-awareness, and alteration in distributed cortical systems supporting emotional semantics and abstraction.",

Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death.

The therapy of such behavioral symptoms should involve a multisystem failure approach. Each component system: external environment, sensory, response (motor), central nervous system and the pathophysiologic state of the patient himself (internal environment) is interdependent. Failure of one component can compromise the whole. It also seems clinically evident that treatment directed to-ward strengthening other components may enable the patient in failure to function adequately. Examples are given of how treatment of other systems enables the central nervous system to function more efficiently. With the therapeutic approach described, behavioral problems have been ameliorated and psychological disturbances are seldom a threat to medical management.",

Some authors have suggested abandoning the label 'conversion disorder' and replacing it with the phrase 'functional neurological symptoms'. Two requirements for the diagnosis, namely, the association of psychological factors and the exclusion of feigning, produce several problems and should therefore not be included in the new criteria. Based on studies of the functional anatomy of perception and movement, it is likely that functional neurological symptoms are interpreted by patients as being involuntary and occurring spontaneously. In the current diagnostic criteria, the emphasis is on the exclusion of other disorders; clinical features that support the diagnosis have been proposed for the new criteria. Psychiatrists should be consulted if depression or anxiety disorders are suspected. If recovery comes to a standstill, such patients should be referred to psychologists who are experienced in cognitive behavioural therapy for patients with functional neurological symptoms.",

The detection of muscle fatigue can assist in the improvement of the performance in many fields such as clinical diagnosis and sports biomechanics and facilitates in the commercial development of various industries [2], [3]. Analysis of fatigue conditions of a muscle also plays a major role in the rehabilitation processes and kinesiology [4]. The behaviour of sEMG signals is different under non-fatigue and fatigue conditions due to energetic, metabolic, and structural variations in the muscle [5]. Hence, in this work, the differences in the muscle activity under non-fatigue and fatigue conditions as determined from recorded multichannel sEMG signals of biceps brachii and triceps brachii during dynamic contractions are studied.",

Lesions affecting primary sensorimotor cortices result in primary sensorimotor deficits that are qualitatively all-or-nothing, such as blindness (hemianopia) and paralysis (hemiparesis).

Lesions affecting modality-specific association regions result in conceptually more complex disorders that are confined to a single modality, such as nonfluent aphasia (a form of motor speech disorder reflecting the language-dominant hemisphere) or prosopagnosia (a visual disorder impairing the ability to disambiguate visually similar entities, specifically faces, reflecting the “what” visual pathway in inferotemporal cortices).",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

      "title": "Quality of Life of Older Adults with Urinary Incontinence",
      "abstract": "Health-related quality of life is now recognized as an important patient outcome in response to a disease, treatment, or procedure. The term health-related quality of life (HRQL) refers to a multidimensional construct involving the individual's evaluation or judgment about subjective well-being and objective attributes of functioning. Although there are varying definitions of HRQL, a group of international experts agreed that the fundamental dimensions of HRQL are physical, mental/psychological, and social health, as well as global perceptions of function and well-being.1 Other dimensions of HRQL might also be important, depending on the purpose of an investigation and the specific health condition being studied. These dimensions include cognitive or neuropsychologic functioning, sexual functioning and intimacy, personal productivity, symptoms, pain, energy/vitality, sleep, and self-esteem. Urinary incontinence and its associated symptoms can have a significant impact on the HRQL of older adults. Evidence suggests that incontinence can affect HRQL in diverse and far-reaching ways and that there is considerable variability among individuals in their perceptions and responses to urinary symptoms.2 In addition, there are differences in HRQL impairment, depending on the type of incontinence, the age, and possibly the gender of the patient.2 Surprisingly, research has not consistently documented a strong relationship between incontinence severity (typically measured in the number of incontinent episodes or grams of fluid lost on a pad test) and HRQL impact. The explanation for the lack of a strong relationship between these two types of patient outcome measures is unclear. In this issue are two reports that examine aspects of the HRQL of community-dwelling older adults with urinary incontinence. The reports approach the topic from different perspectives and research methodologies, yet each report makes an important contribution that furthers our understanding related to the impact of incontinence on one or more domains of quality of life. Catherine DuBeau and her colleagues3 present descriptions of the impact of urge incontinence in the lives of older women and men obtained through qualitative research methodologies. The ultimate goal of their work is to develop a HRQL instrument that has strong validity for use in urge incontinent older patients. These authors compared patient-defined areas of impact obtained through focus group interviews with provider/expert areas of impact obtained from the literature and included in published condition-specific quality of life instruments. DuBeau et al. also examined the patients'descriptions to identify the possible role of patients'explanatory style as a mediator of the impact of incontinence on HRQL. DuBeau et al.'s study represents the second generation of instrument development work in research on the HRQL of incontinent patients. She and her colleagues are to be commended for their sound approach to the development of a new condition-specific HRQL instrument. Because HRQL is, by definition, the patient's own perspectives on his/her functioning and well-being, the use of focus group and content analysis methodologies is appropriate. As a next step in establishing content validity, the authors could either take the items identified in the focus groups back to the participants or take them to a new group of older adults with urge incontinence for further validation. Another critical step, one which is usually skipped in HRQL instrument development, would be to have the participants evaluate the importance of each of the specified items in relation to the other items. This would help identify whether each item should be weighted equally or given a different value in calculating subscale scores. See also p 683 and p 693 One limitation in DuBeau et al.'s study was the use of a nonrepresentative sample, i.e., the sample was all white and predominantly of high socioeconomic status. Cultural and economic differences could affect perceptions of the impact of incontinence in participants'lives. Despite this limitation, the results from this study emphasize the differences between the way experts and patients view HRQL and provide new information on the impact of urge incontinence on older adults. More than half of the items identified by DuBeau and her colleagues were not described previously, which may be related to the different conceptual orientations of researchers about what constitutes HRQL versus what factors influence it. For example, DuBeau and her colleagues include a domain on coping. In some theoretical perspectives, this might be considered a personal trait that is not a characteristic of HRQL, whereas in others it might be viewed as a mediating variable of HRQL.4 Also, specific items identified — such as the inevitability of incontinence, that incontinence is a psychological not a physical problem, the association of incontinence with women's biology, and fear of aging — reflect an individual's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs rather than HRQL. A significant finding in this study was the greater influence of urge incontinence on coping with embarrassment and the interruption of activities compared with the performance of activities, which is used typically in geriatric assessment models. A novel aspect of DuBeau et al.'s study was the examination of explanatory style, i.e., the habitual manner in which persons explain how and why uncontrollable adverse events such as illness occur to them, as a possible mediator of HRQL. Previous research suggests that explanatory style correlates with the range of responses of individuals to illnesses. It makes sense that explanatory style affects responses to incontinence. The authors'findings indicate an association between negative explanatory statements and HRQL items and suggest that there may be gender differences. However, the results on gender differences must be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of men in the sample. No consistent relationship was found between incontinence severity, as measured by the number of incontinent episodes on a voiding diary, and explanatory style. Theodore Johnson II and his colleagues5 conducted a secondary analysis from data collected in the 1990–1991 National Survey of Self Care and Aging to assess whether urinary incontinence and its severity were associated with the self-rating of poor health. The National Survey of Self-Care and Aging is a random sampling of geographic clusters of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in the contiguous United States. This study had a sample size of 3485, with oversampling of the oldest-old age group and men to enable subgroup analyses. Findings from Johnson et al.'s study confirm earlier research about the relationship between incontinence and health perceptions. This is an important milestone. Urinary incontinence was associated with poor self-rated health for white subjects who had no instrumental activities of daily living impairments even after controlling for age, activity of daily living status, and comorbid health conditions. The odds of rating one's health poor were doubled if the incontinence was mild to moderate and quadrupled if the incontinence was severe. Previous research examining the relationship between incontinence and self-rated health status has been criticized because of the failure to account adequately for frailty. Johnson et al.'s study did control carefully for functional status and comorbidity and found that urinary incontinence is associated with poor self-rated health independent of frailty. Although analyzed carefully and interpreted cautiously, this study has two main limitations. First, it was a post hoc comparison dependent on cross-sectional data collected in a larger study for a different purpose. Thus, as the authors pointed out, conclusions about causality are problematic. Prospective studies are needed. Second, the quantitative nature of the study, with fixed choice responses to a survey instrument, does not allow for the breadth of responses that might come from in-depth interviews of incontinent individuals, allowing better understanding of why they rated their health as poor. Was it because of the incontinence and its associated symptoms or consequences, or are there other unexplained factors that might have been missed? Future research should address the frame of reference used by incontinent adults in their self-ratings of health. Krause and Jay6 found that global ratings of health are interpreted in different ways by different people and that these ways may depend on race and, possibly, education. Understanding why persons rate health in a particular way may be helpful in determining appropriate interventions. Additional studies on the HRQL of incontinent older adults are greatly needed. There is much that we still need to learn about how age, gender, and lower urinary tract pathophysiology alter the impact of incontinence on HRQL, as well as the factors that influence HRQL. However, these studies should be based on a clear conceptualization of HRQL in which the determinants of quality of life are distinguished from the dimensions of quality of life. Wilson and Cleary7 have presented a useful model that helps categorize clinical variables and shows their relationships with measures of HRQL. In their model, various patient outcomes are linked with causal pathways to show how intervening variables mediate the effect on HRQL. Their model includes five levels of patient outcomes: biological and physiological factors, symptoms, functioning, general health perceptions, and quality of life. Characteristics of the individual (e.g., personality, motivation, values, preferences, and symptom amplification) and of the environment (e.g., psychological, social, and economic supports) influence the five levels in complex ways. In addition, nonmedical factors may directly influence an individual's rating of overall quality of life. Translating their model to incontinence research, the biological and physiological factors might include the underlying pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract, urodynamic variables, and pelvic support and pelvic muscle strength characteristics. Symptoms are the patient's perception of abnormal physical, emotional, or cognitive states and are influenced by demographic and cultural factors. Examples of these include lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency, frequency, nocturia, and incontinence. Functioning refers to the individual's ability to carry out his/her normal activities. General health perceptions would be the individual's self-rating of health status. Overall quality of life would be the individual's life satisfaction as a whole. In conclusion, the qualitative study by DuBeau and her colleagues and the survey analysis by Johnson and his associates complement each other, enriching our understanding of the way incontinence is interpreted and processed by patients. Further depth and refinement in our understanding of the impact of incontinence can lead to more focused and more effective interventions that will improve the HRQL of the millions of Americans who suffer from incontinence.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a disease that occurs frequently. However, people do not know much about this disease and many doctors find it difficult to diagnose such patients. Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Symptoms are the body's major signaling device, but symptoms often are frustratingly vague, subjective, and ill reported. In addition, challenges attend making decisions about an individual's ability to function based solely on the medical diagnosis, particularly when impairment is subtle or subjective. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a model for understanding the limits of the medical approach to determining impairment and disability. A protocol from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is used to define CFS. This protocol is not a list of diagnostic criteria, and some patients with chronic fatigue may not meet the CDC definition. The syndrome reflects dysfunction in the neuroendocrine system similar in some ways to that seen with depressive illness, and most patients seen for this condition fulfill the criteria for depression, which is another illness characterized by fatigue and somatic complaints. Physicians who evaluate and treat patients with subtle persistent illness know that employers and coworkers respond less positively to an employee's needs when illness is subtle than when impairment is obvious. Physicians must be clear about the family, job, and employment risks patients take when they stay out of work for medical reasons; they also must recognize the risk these patients take when they continue to work despite impaired performance.",

The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

This is consistent with the proposal that sensory dysfunction could provoke distress and a discrepancy between the multi-sensory frame given by experience and the actual perception. Both vestibular stimuli and vestibular dysfunction can underlie unreal experiences. Vestibular afferents provide a frame of reference (linear and angular head acceleration) within which spatial information from other senses is interpreted. This paper reviews evidence that symptoms of depersonalization/derealization associated with vestibular dysfunction are a consequence of a sensory mismatch between disordered vestibular input and other sensory signals of orientation.",

Several considerations prove this type of generalization wrong, and may lead to false conclusions: for example epidemiological data obtained from rates of medical utilization, the comparison of ill persons and patients suffering from functional gastrointestinal disorders, or a survey of literature about the significance of illness behavior and psychological factors in the demand for medical care.

      "abstract": "Definition of somatoform disorders: somatic symptoms or mental symptoms? Somatoform disorders, which used to be considered as mental disorders, are frequent, especially in the context of non-psychiatric medical consultations. The absence of an identifiable organic cause for these disorders often leads clinicians to underestimates their harmful consequences or even challenge their validity as disease. However, they are real disorders that may have a major impact on the quality of life and functional outcomes of the subject and whose mechanisms can be targeted by therapeutic interventions. Although psychiatric classifications support a unitary approach (i.e. the \"somatic symptom disorder and related disorders\" of the American Psychiatric Association's DSM - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - or the \"bodily distress disorder\" of the World Health Organization), each non-psychiatric specialty has described some \"functional somatic syndromes\", which are deemed more specific and less severe regarding psychiatric severity, and thus more often remain in the field of non-psychiatric specialties. In this article, we have presented the initial stage of any medical approach of suffering: a clarification of the issues involved in the delimitation of the normal and the pathological, and the organization of the different categories between them. These nosographic aspects are the condition of a rigorous approach in medicine, and of a relationship with the patient that is useful to understand and relieve his or her genuine suffering.Définition des troubles somatoformes : entre symptômes physiques et symptômes mentaux. Les troubles somatoformes, considérés comme des troubles mentaux par la nosographie psychiatrique, sont particulièrement fréquents, mais surtout rencontrés dans le contexte des consultations médicales non psychiatriques. L’absence de cause organique identifiable pour ces maladies fait souvent sous-estimer leur retentissement, voire douter de leur existence. Il s’agit pourtant de troubles à part entière, avec un impact majeur sur la qualité de vie et les activités des sujets en souffrant et avec des mécanismes accessibles à la thérapeutique. Si la nosographie psychiatrique contemporaine privilégie une approche unitaire (« troubles à symptomatologie somatique et apparentés » du Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux, « bodily distress disorder » de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé), chaque spécialité a décrit un ou plusieurs « syndromes somatiques fonctionnels » qui, du fait de leur spécificité présumée et de leur sévérité psychiatrique moins grande, restent le plus souvent du domaine des spécialités non psychiatriques. Dans cet article est présentée l’étape initiale à toute approche médicale de la souffrance : une clarification des enjeux de la définition du normal et du pathologique et de l’organisation des différentes catégories nosographiques entre elles. Ces aspects nosographiques sont la condition d’une approche rigoureuse en médecine et d’une relation avec le patient qui soit utile à la compréhension et au soulagement de sa souffrance.",

Only tasks assessing alerting/vigilance are strongly related to fatigue. Areas with brain atrophy in fatigue patients overlap with brain regions activated in healthy controls performing alerting/vigilance tasks. Fatigue is not a compensatory state, nor a psychogenic trait. It is a feeling with behavioral effects that seems to be caused by brain atrophy or a neurochemical dysfunction of the alerting/vigilance system.",

They originate on the basis of dysregulated control processes and perceptional alterations at a superordinate level of the organism. Under excessive stress, any vegetatively regulated system might develop functional disorders. Hence they can also be observed in veterinary medicine. The «incongruence» between the organic findings and the symptoms reported represents a diagnostic challenge, which general practitioners, due to the high prevalence of functional disorders are confronted with on a daily basis. Therefore a comprehensible explanatory model is needed in order to build trust and to motivate the patient for treatment. The new S3 guidelines «functional disorders» provide constructive and pragmatic information for the adequate treatment of patients with functional disorders.Zusammenfassung. Funktionelle Störungen entziehen sich definitionsgemäss einer biomorphologischen Befundsicherung auf Organebene, denn sie entstehen im Rahmen übergeordneter Wahrnehmungs- und Steuerungsprozesse. Jeder vegetativ regulierte Organismus zeigt unter Belastung funktionelle Symptome. So kommen stressinduzierte Störungen auch in der Tiermedizin vor. Die «Inkongruenz» zwischen Organ-Befund und Symptom-Empfinden ist eine diagnostische Herausforderung, stellt aufgrund der Häufigkeit von funktionellen Störungen aber eine Art Normalität dar. Deshalb ist ein für den Patienten gut verständliches Erklärungsmodell eine wichtige Voraussetzung für den Vertrauensaufbau und die Therapiemotivation. Die neuen S3-Leitlinien «Funktionelle Körperbeschwerden» sind eine konstruktiv-pragmatische Wegleitung für den Umgang mit diesen häufigen Leiden.",

Horner's syndrome is best understood and most frequently diagnosed in the dog. However, Horner's syndrome occurs in all of the most common domestic species and can indicate significant neurological disease. The clinical signs of Horner's syndrome in horses include miosis, ptosis, enophthalmia, and protrusion of the nictitating membrane. Facial nerve paralysis is one of the more frequent neuro-ophthalmic disorders in the dog. Hemifacial spasms result in a narrowed palpebral fissure and an asymmetrical face secondary to the facial muscles' contractions.

      "title": "Symptoms and the perception of disease",
      "abstract": "Any symptom represents a perception of an abnormal internal body state. The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas. Our procedures for selecting medical students and physicians need to assess these skills as well as scientific qualifications.",

Its etiology is still unclear, and the clinical presentation is quite heterogeneous, manifesting itself through obsessions and/or compulsions that are associated with high levels of anxiety and time consumption. Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities.

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "The following practical issues in psychopharmacotherapy of patients with mental retardation (MR) or other developmental disability (DD) are discussed, with some theoretical speculations: Persons with MR/DD have high rates of psychiatric disorders/symptoms, many of which are drug-responsive and not satisfactorily treated with other modalities alone. However, diagnosis is often complicated by concurrent multiple disorders (both psychiatric and medical/surgical), masking or distortion of symptoms, and communication impairments. Comorbidity and associated treatments should be considered in medication choice. Compared to psychiatric patients of normal IQ, patients with MR may be more sensitive to side effects and toxicity as well as responsive to lower doses, possibly related to less neuronal substrate, qualitative brain differences, or developmental stage. Unexpected or disappointing drug responses may also be related to such statistical quirks as \"end-of-curve\" phenomena. Ripples, ratcheting, and other ecobehavioral considerations influence treatment outcome and drug management. Target symptoms and expected drug benefits should be defined in consultation with caregivers as well as, when possible, the patient. Because drug responses of patients with MR are especially unpredictable, unreliable, sensitive to dose, and fraught with side effects, each medication trial might ideally be approached as a single-subject experiment on a compassionate protocol: quantify the baseline with ratings, behavior counts or other objective measures; start low and titrate slowly; monitor progress with repeated objective measures.",

      "abstract": "Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is at the complex interface of the body and mind and therefore also physical and mental health. It has been neglected by medicine so little is known about its mechanism or treatment. However, there have been recent critical developments, particularly establishing it is as common as Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis and associated with poor outcomes and consequently associated with very high rates of disability and both health and social care costs. There have also been critical changes in its diagnosis. The historical requirement of identifying causative stressors has been removed as it is now clear that these are not found in a significant proportion of patients. Instead, there has been increased emphasis on identifying 'positive neurological signs' which allow its reliable distinction from other disorders. Such signs can also be explained to patients to help them to understand the basis of the diagnosis and how it can be caused by dysfunction of cognitive processes such as attention and illness representations, thereby increasing acceptance of a complex and stigmatised diagnosis. The widespread adoption of the acronym FND and therefore the term 'functional', an aetiologically neutral term, has also facilitated critical steps in uniting patients and clinicians. FND patients regularly have current and/or past comorbid symptoms presenting to other specialities such as fibromyalgia and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which can be viewed as related disorders with overlapping mechanisms. Insights from FND research are therefore well positioned to inform the broader field of functional disorders which account for approximately 30% of morbidity and costs across medicine.",

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral nerve damage caused by trauma, surgery, or some diseases is common in clinical practice and may be accompanied by the development of neuropathic pain. Nerves injuries are caused by car and labor accidents, by cutting and penetrating objects, crushing, fractures, stretching and gunshot wound, professional or amateur sportsmen injuries. Chronic post-surgical pain is a major clinical problem. Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain varies depending on the type of surgery and surgical technique – after limb amputation, thoracotomy, mastectomy, hysterectomy, hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, colectomy, vasectomy, Cesarean section. Such pain can transform into persistent, severe and refractory chronic neuropathic pain, which is a serious social problem because it often affects the most productive population, sometimes causing disability, have a high level of comorbidity in the form of psychopathological conditions, sleep disorders. The pathophysiology and neurotransmission of neuropathic pain have complex and not fully understood mechanisms. They involve produce local and systemic signal pain cytokines, disturbances in the modulation of sensory flows, peripheral and central sensitization, neurotransmitter imbalance, changes in gene expression and implicate of the limbic system and hypothalamus contribute to the modulation of mood and behavior. Options for managing neuropathic pain with nerve damage include a limited number of pharmacological drugs and interventional treatment methods. Main drugs used in relief in neuropathic pain include tricyclics antidepressants and dual norepinephrine/5 hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids – gabapentin and pregabalin, capsaicin, opioid analgesics, especially tramadol and methadone are recommended as second line drugs. For patient’s refractory to pharmacotherapy, neurosurgical decompression and nerve reconstruction and neuromodulation procedures are recommended to relieve neuropathic pain.

      "title": "Mental fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests that three major patterns of disturbance of the supervisory mental processes that regulate self-generated mental activity can occur, either alone or together, in a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Psychomotor poverty involves a diminished ability to initiate activity. Psychomotor disorganization reflects impaired ability to select between activities. Reality distortion, which is manifest as delusions and hallucinations, appears to reflect an abnormality of internal monitoring of mental activity. Each of these three syndromes is associated with a specific pattern of disordered function in multimodal association cortex and related subcortical nuclei. The evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a major role in modulating the supervisory mental processes, though serotonin and noradrenaline are also implicated. While a particular neurotransmitter might have conflicting influences on different syndromes, the differential involvement of different anatomic sites and different neuroreceptor types offers the possibility of successful treatment even when different syndromes co-exist.",

Suppresses the craving for alcohol and changed all mental functions, emotions, morality, accountability, value systems and encourages those traits that serve the satisfaction of desire - manipulative, passivity, impatience, recklessness, self-centeredness, hedonism.Dependence means the state of periodic or chronic intoxication with alcohol and is characterized by: a strong desire and need for acquiring and consuming alcohol, the tendency of increasing amounts of alcohol taken, physical and psychological dependence, adverse health consequences and distortions in social and professional functioning.There are several different divisions of alcoholics, today in most of our institutions and the distribution of benefits by the way alcoholics drinking on periodic and continuous (daily), which is easier and more convenient to use. In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children. They grew up with a father or both parents, in these alcoholics no existence, depending on the family or the father has, have trouble with the law as well as injuries in a drunken state.

Recientemente, fue descrita una enfermedad conocida como Síndrome de Disfunción Cognitiva de perros senior o “enfermedad de Alzheimer del perro”, debido a las similitudes clínicas y patológicas con esta enfermedad en humanos. Los animales afectados desarrollan cambios morfofuncionales en diferentes zonas cerebrales, lo que probablemente conduce a la aparición de cambios asociados al decline cognitivo, es decir, disminución en la capacidad de recopilar información, procesarla, retenerla y tomar decisiones, lo que termina provocando efectos deletéreos sobre la calidad de vida del paciente afectado al no lograr desenvolverse normalmente en su medio. Dada la inespecificidad de los signos clínicos, la anamnesis y los test comportamentales han sido considerados como las principales herramientas diagnósticas para identificar este síndrome. Por otra parte, debido a que aún no han sido plenamente establecidos los aspectos etiopatológicos, los mecanismos implicados en el desarrollo de esta neuropatología aún siguen inconclusos, por lo tanto, no son muchas las estrategias terapéuticas disponibles, de las cuales solo la selegilina ha sido aprobada por la FDA.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In contrast to many clinical pain syndromes, wherein a medical history and physical examination usually lead to the diagnosis of a structural lesion or biochemical alteration, the functional pain syndromes are without fixed organic peripheral changes. The functional pain disorders include fibromyalgia (FM), atypical facial pain (also termed idiopathic facial pain), non-specific low-back pain (NSLBP), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and are characterized by their persistence, intractability, and apparent absence of peripheral disease. Various psychiatric designations have been applied to pain disorders that are characterized by medically unexplained symptoms: somatization, somatoform disorders, psychogenic disease, chronic multisymptom illness, affective spectrum disorders, and central sensitization syndromes as well as functional disorders (Barsky &amp; Borus, 1999; Clauw &amp; Chrousos, 1997; Clauw et al.,1997; Hudson et al.,1992; Hudson &amp; Pope, 1989; Wessely et al.,1999). A functional disorder is one that, after appropriate medical assessment, cannot be explained in terms of a conventionally defined medical disease based on biochemical or structural abnormalities (Derbyshire et al.,2004; Wessely et al.,1999; Drossman et al.,2000).Although these disorders are routinely assessed and viewed as separate clinical entities, combining these systemic and regional conditions in a review is justified by several observations: (1) there is considerable overlap in the case definitions of specific syndromes, (2) the disorders co-aggregate in individuals, (3) patients with different syndromes share non-symptom characteristics, (4) the functional syndromes all respond to similar therapies, (5) the syndromes share common neurobiological mechanisms, such as abnormal sensory processing, neuroendocrine, and autonomic dysfunction (Wessely et al.,1999),",

Historically, conversion symptoms were thought to reflect underlying psychological conflicts although recent behavioural theories view them as learned responses to stressful life circumstances and emphasize environmental contingencies in the maintenance of the disorder. Although early studies often revealed underlying organic disease in patients initially diagnosed with Conversion Disorder, this now occurs less frequently because of increased sophistication of diagnostic tools and better understanding of neurological disorders. However, misdiagnosis is still common because of reliance on 'negative' diagnostic testing and unvalidated 'positive signs' misinterpreted as indicative of hysteria. Psychological factors may affect the course of almost every major category of disease and in many cases a diagnosis of hysteria is not indicated and the more appropriate diagnosis is Psychological Factors Affecting A Medical Condition. It is not possible to definitively differentiate between conscious and unconscious production of symptoms thus blurring the distinction between Conversion and Factitious disorders.",

Furthermore, brain lesions themselves may produce striking behavioral alterations that can be mistakenly attributed to depression, or striking behavioral changes due to depression may be mistakenly attributed to the brain lesion. Based on five case studies, several clinical guidelines for recognizing and diagnosing depression in brain-damaged patients are offered. These cases also provide a data base to generate initial hypotheses about the neuroanatomical basis of the depressive syndrome.

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

Physical symptoms such as headaches, back pain, abdominal pain, dizziness and feelings of weakness or fatigue are common. MUS is a working hypothesis based on the assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated but clinical condition presented by the patient was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS. The biopsychosocial model proposes illness to be viewed as a result of interacting mechanisms at the biomedical, interpersonal and environmental or contextual levels. Therefore the exploration of symptoms in patients with MUS should focus on the exact chronology of the symptoms themselves, including where and when the symptoms appear. Based on the exploration of symptoms, the clinician is able to evaluate the severity of MUS.",

      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

The symptoms referred to as FSS are comprised of varying combinations of pain in different parts of the body, functional disturbances attributed to organs like cardiovascular or gastrointestinal dysfunctions or dizziness, and symptoms surrounding fatigue. Their main characteristics, pathophysiology, and etiology are briefly discussed. In addition, the authors discuss the relation between FSS and the current DSM classification of somatic symptom disorder and other related diagnostic categories.",

Females who experience persistent and increased level of anxiety for long time, is harmful and impact on their daily living, life style and quality of life. They may struggle to complete overall functioning of the patient.",

The causes of amputation include trauma, infection, diabetes, vascular disease, cancer and other diseases. The impact of amputation on psychological situation and social and family relationships is undeniable, because physical disability also affects one’s social and mental health, in addition to his/her psychological adaptation and compared to the ordinary people, these people are suffering more from social isolation. Therefore, any limb amputation not only is considered as a physical injury but is also followed by psychological- emotional damages.",

From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness. An apraxia might involve difficulty in performing relatively simple movements or complex action sequences involving objects.",

Hunger leads to initiation of eating. Eating activates inhibitory signals producing satiety. Satiety is the quality or state of being fed or gratified to or beyond capacity mediated in the short term by mechanical factors related to swallowing and gastric distention, chemical factors related to taste and smell, and psychological factors (sensory-specific satiety) and in the long term by chemoreception of nutrients and gastrointestinal (GI) peptides and neuroendocrine and neuronal factors and is a major motivation for terminating eating (1).",

Its diagnosis is by exclusion and suspicion.

The onset and severity of terminal decline vary greatly between individuals. It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine abnormalities in depression have been regarded, by many authors, as relatively specific markers of nosological subtypes of the disorder, e.g. primary vs. secondary, endogenous vs. non-endogenous or unipolar vs. bipolar depression. They should reflect the same changes in central neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenergic insufficiency and/or cholinergic hyperactivity) that were hypothesized as the cause of clinical symptoms. This view is challenged on the basis of our own neuroendocrine investigations in 317 psychiatric patients and 103 normal controls. According to these studies the abnormalities are nosologically rather unspecific. They are induced by a large variety of factors, e.g. emotional stress associated with the clinical symptomatology, weight loss due to malnutrition as a consequence of reduced appetite, medication and drug withdrawal. Stress-induced hypercortisolism appears to be the most common abnormality that may trigger other neuroendocrine dysfunctions, such as a blunted TSH response to TRH. Differences in neuroendocrine abnormalities of depressives are probably due to variations in the manifold factors influencing the hormonal axes involved, to temporal changes in hormonal patterns (e.g. one abnormality triggering another) and to individual differences in the basic activity and the responsiveness of the various axes.",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer.

      "abstract": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is typically characterized by progressive decline in executive function, behavior and language, but often presents with heterogeneous symptoms and co-exists with motor neuron disease (MND). One commonly overlooked symptom is somatic complaint, which can attract functional or psychiatric diagnosis. This case report illustrated a case of FTD and MND that was initially misdiagnosed as motor conversion disorder. Emerging studies in motor conversion disorders and FTD-MND suggest an overlap in the neurobiological underpinning. Extreme care is critical when excluding organic disorders in psychiatric presentation of atypical somatic symptoms.",

If a slight physical anomaly exists, the person's concern is markedly excessive and this preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. This diagnosis is most appropriately used when symptoms associated with this dissatisfaction with the body shape and size are not better explained by an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonus is een frequent voorkomende hyperkinetische bewegingsstoornis die wordt gekenmerkt door spierschokken (positieve myoclonus) en/of het kortdurend wegvallen van de spiertonus (negatieve myoclonus). De klinische presentatie van myoclonus is heel divers. De schokken kunnen in een of meerdere lichaamsdelen optreden of gegeneraliseerd zijn. Myoclonus kan optreden in het gelaat, de nek, romp en de ledematen. Het kan in rust of juist bij actie optreden en wel of niet stimulusgevoelig zijn. Over het algemeen belemmert myoclonus patienten ernstig in hun dagelijks functioneren, zoals bij eten/drinken, schrijven en lopen. Myoclonus heeft vele oorzaken, zowel verworden als genetisch. Voor het vaststellen van de onderliggende oorzaak en het bepalen van de juiste behandeling is het belangrijk myoclonus te herkennen en te onderscheiden van andere bewegingsstoornissen zoals bijvoorbeeld tremor en chorea. Na het herkennen kan myoclonus op basis van een anatomische classificatie worden ingedeeld in subtypes, i.e. naar de plaats in het zenuwstelsel waar de schokken ontstaan. Dit zijn corticale (hersenschors), subcorticale (diepe hersenkernen/hersenstam), spinale (ruggenmerg) en perifere (zenuwen/spieren) myoclonus. Daarnaast kunnen schokken ook een uiting zijn van een functionele (psychogene) stoornis. Door myoclonus naar anatomische classificatie te groeperen kan diagnostiek gericht ingezet worden. Dit proefschrift biedt een nieuw diagnostische aanpak voor patienten met myoclonus. Het beschrijft de uitdagingen en het belang van het nauwkeurig klinisch fenotyperen van zowel motorische als niet-motorische symptomen en de classificatie van het anatomisch myoclonus subtype. Het klinisch neurofysiologisch onderzoek heeft een belangrijke toegevoegde waarde naast de klinische beoordeling in de (sub)classificatie van myoclonus.",

      "title": "Percepción de fatiga central en la enfermedad de parkinson: factores clínicos, psicopatológicos y neuropsicológicos",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) se caracteriza por la neurodegeneracion de celulas dopaminergicas localizadas en la sustancia negra pars compacta. Algunas evidencias sugieren que no solo se afecta el sistema dopaminergico, sino tambien el noradrenergico, serotoninergico, colinergico, etc. Esto ampliaria el espectro de manifestaciones clinicas y justificaria la aparicion de sintomas psiquiatricos y cognitivos. La fatiga central es uno de los sintomas mas frecuentes e invalidantes de la EP. Sin embargo, su mecanismo causal y relacion con otros sintomas no-motores es poco conocida. Segun la hipotesis de A. Chaudhuri, debe considerarse el esfuerzo voluntario como una variable sujeta a sistemas de control que regulan el esfuerzo realizado. Algunos de estos mecanismos se relacionan con las respuestas motivacionales y emocionales, siendo influenciados por los cambios somaticos y la retroalimentacion desde los sistemas motores, sensoriales y cognitivos. Asi, las respuestas emocionales son uno de los elementos necesarios para la percepcion normal de fatiga. La hipotesis del marcador somatico de Bechara considera que las senales somaticas procedentes de la respuesta vegetativa ante una emocion (marcadores somaticos) son procesadas por estructuras neuronales superiores y regulan la toma de decisiones. Este proceso puede valorarse con pruebas neuropsicologicas, destacando entre ellas el Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). OBJETIVOS HIPOTESIS: Los objetivos principales fueron: (1) describir la prevalencia de fatiga central en una muestra de pacientes con EP, (2) evaluar la relacion entre diferentes sintomas psicopatologicos y la fatiga central y (3) evaluar la relacion entre la percepcion de los marcadores somaticos y la presencia de fatiga central en pacientes con EP. Los objetivos secundarios fueron: (1) valorar la asociacion entre la presencia y gravedad de fatiga central y diferentes caracteristicas clinicas, (2) valorar la relacion entre la presencia y gravedad de fatiga central y el rendimiento cognitivo en tareas neuropsicologicas que evaluan la capacidad atencional y funciones ejecutivas en pacientes con EP y (3) valorar la relacion entre diferentes variables clinicas, neuropsicologicas y psicopatologicas y el rendimiento en el IGT en pacientes con EP. La hipotesis del presente trabajo considera que la incorrecta interpretacion de los marcadores somaticos y/o la existencia de psicopatologia que altere la motivacion, podrian aumentar la percepcion de fatiga central en los pacientes con EP. METODOS: Estudio transversal con una muestra de 96 pacientes con EP. La gravedad de la enfermedad se evaluo con la escala UPDRS y la de Hoehn y Yahr. Los sintomas psicopatologicos se valoraron con escalas especificas y validadas para depresion, anhedonia, ansiedad, apatia, impulsividad y sensibilidad al refuerzo y recompensa. Ademas, a los pacientes se les realizo una exploracion neuropsicologica que incluia pruebas que valoran el cortex prefrontal dorsolateral (Stroop, Trail Making Task y Torre de Londres) y el ventromedial (IGT). RESULTADOS De los 96 pacientes, 34 (35.4%) presentaron fatiga y 28 (82.4%) la consideraron uno de sus peores sintomas. No habia diferencias entre los pacientes con y sin fatiga en relacion al genero, edad, edad de debut de la enfermedad, estadio clinico, fenotipo y complicaciones motoras, tratamiento e insomnio. Los pacientes con fatiga tenian una mayor lateralizacion motora izquierda y una menor gravedad motora. La presencia de fatiga se asocio con una mayor frecuencia de antecedentes psiquiatricos y una mayor puntuacion en las escalas de depresion, ansiedad y apatia (menor curiosidad intelectual e iniciacion de la accion). La depresion, ansiedad, curiosidad intelectual y lateralidad se relacionaron con una mayor gravedad de la percepcion de fatiga. No hubo diferencias estadisticamente significativas entre los dos grupos de pacientes en las pruebas neuropsicologicas realizadas, excepto en el IGT. A medida que los pacientes con fatiga progresaban en la realizacion del IGT, no mostraban un aprendizaje, seleccionando cartas con mas riesgo a lo largo de todo el proceso. La peor realizacion del IGT tambien se relacionaba con una mayor impulsividad, ansiedad rasgo, sensibilidad al castigo y apatia. DISCUSION Los resultados sugieren que la fatiga es frecuente en la EP y que se asocia con sintomas de apatia, depresion y ansiedad. Tambien indican que los diferentes dominios de la apatia tienen un impacto diferente sobre la fatiga, siendo la curiosidad intelectual y la iniciacion de la accion las subescalas que muestran una mayor relacion con la presencia de fatiga central. Desde un punto de vista neurobiologico, se podria hipotetizar que esta considerable asociacion deriva de un origen neurobiologico similar. Los pacientes con fatiga tenian un peor rendimiento en el IGT, hecho que sugiere una mayor dificultad para asociar los resultados de un esfuerzo con senales emocionales o autonomicas de origen interno. Esta observacion es congruente con la hipotesis de A. Chaudhuri: el peor rendimiento en el IGT indica que la fatiga emerge, al menos en parte, de una deficiente evaluacion de los estimulos de origen somatico.",

      "title": "Psychologically determined disorders",
      "abstract": "Neurologists frequently see patients with symptoms or inconsistent signs that are not explicable in terms of any recognized neurological disease process. Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

Self-injurious behavior or compulsion refers to any voluntary action resulting in self-damage. Compulsive disorders are characterized by repetitive, persistent, or sustained behaviors in excess of what is required for normal function, especially if severe enough to interfere with normal function. Cutaneous compulsions (psychodermatoses) often have an underlying organic disease or trigger. Diagnosis and treatment include identifying the underlying trigger, treating secondary dermatoses, and modifying behavior to prevent recurrence; medications are a helpful adjunct if anxiety interferes with normal activities or learning. Dermatoses may be initiated by a pathology, with subsequent self-injury causing persistence or worsening of lesions. Basic work-up to rule out medical causes of self-injurious behavior include evaluation for pain or pruritus, including musculoskeletal disease, neurologic disease, and/or primary dermatologic disease.",

      "title": "What Dimensions of Heterogeneity Are Relevant for Treatment Outcome?",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a disorder, or a class of disorders, of cognition. Defining features include a loss of coordination in core perception, attention, memory, and executive functions together with the dysregulation of emotion. These features are the strongest contributors to burden of illness. Diagnostic criteria, clinical trials, and popular conceptions typically focus, however, on the more florid positive symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations. As a result, impairments in cognitive–emotional function remain largely undiagnosed and untreated, with no current treatments in routine use that target these impairments. The evidence base for developing new treatments requires cognitive–emotional measures that link to functional capacity as well as to brain changes involved in schizophrenia pathophysiology. This chapter looks at five aspects of cognitive–emotional function in schizophrenia: Which cognitive–emotional impairments characterize schizophrenia patients at first onset? Are functional capacities predicted by these impairments at first onset? What brain systems are involved? How do cognitive–emotional impairments, and their relationships with functional capacity and brain function, progress over time? What are the implications for treatment outcomes? Focus is on the first episode of schizophrenia, since early intervention is likely to have the best impact for improving outcomes. Published in the Strungmann Forum Reports Series.",

Predicting the probability of successful treatment for the patient assumes that the physician has made an accurate diagnosis. In this review, the practical differential diagnosis of MG is reviewed from the perspective of conditions (at presentation of symptoms and signs) that may mimic the disorder. The differential diagnosis includes disorders that limit eye movements (with or without associated diplopia), cause false-positive laboratory studies, and mimic MG but have normal eye movements. The differential diagnosis includes disorders that affect the upper brainstem, cranial nerves, neuromuscular junction, muscles, or local orbit anatomy. Nonneurological systemic diseases (i.e., encephalopathy, sepsis) can produce fluctuating ptosis or eye movements that can occasionally be confused with MG. Although MG is considered often in the differential diagnosis of weakness or fatigue symptoms that lack a correlate on neurological examination (subjective fatigue, breakaway weakness, chronic fatigue syndrome), MG is almost never found.",

This reaction consists of bodily symptoms and disturbances in relations, both interpersonal (withdrawl, irritability, and resentment) and intrapersonal (depressed mood, loss of pleasure in usual activities, helplessness, and injured self-esteem). The diagnosis is made on the history of a traumatic event which the patient perceives as a loss, rather than on symptoms alone. Diagnosis is important because the bodily symptoms are commonly used as a reason for coming to the doctor, because care of the patient demands recognition of all aspects of his illness, and because rational treatment depends on it. Treatment involves several roles of the doctor and his explicit or implicit use of some psychotherapeutic techniques in his medical practice. Four case histories illustrate these principles.",

Neuropsychologists do not always agree as to whether consciousness can be used as a scientific concept ; however their observations provide material for philosophical discussion. In this respect, the facts which are most frequently cited come from clinical studies on patients with split brain, blindsight or negligence. These phenomena illustrate a striking paradox : it is possible for patients to have no conscious awareness of facts (in visual, auditory or tactile modalities) that they nevertheless integrate in their actions ; and they can deny the existence of a disorder that nevertheless restricts their actions. Are such facts relevant for the study of consciousness ? Their heterogeneity, which is related to the diversity of the aims of this research (to describe, to explain, to model) leads one to wonder. Many of these studies do treat mental processes (perception, action, memory, attention, decision) in terms of consciousness and non-consciousness. Does their diversity reflect the richness of their contribution ? -or does it simply reflect a loose, metaphorical extension of the notion of \"consciousness\" which would evacuate the concept of its philosophical content as a unity ? The disagreements between neuropsychological scientists deserve our interest on several accounts, because they illustrate different conceptions of cerebral functionning and reveal the existence of theoretical differences that are not just the reflection of differences between disciplinary fields.",

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

PTEs may also negatively affect physical health through two modifiable pathways (i.e., dysregulation of stress reactions, emotional inhibition), which can operate in conjunction with, or independent of, negative health behaviors and psychopathological disorders. Such pathways can serve as additional treatment targets for PTE-exposed persons in healthcare settings.",

      "title": "Conducting the assessment: examining the patient",
      "abstract": "In general hospital and community settings, the term ‘physical examination’ is almost always applied to the procedures used by medical and other staff to examine the body, including the nervous system, of patients. In mental health settings, the terms ‘psy­chological examination’ or ‘mental examination’ might seem most appropriate for the procedures used to examine the mind. However, the lengthier term ‘mental state examination’ is usually used, often with capitals, for reasons of tradition. This term is often shortened to MSE. You will find that effective communication of the re­sults of the MSE requires familiarity with many new terms and with their precise meanings. It is important that you grapple with these issues early on in your training. Like specific diagnostic terms, the terms for specific abnormalities of mental state become an ef­fective shorthand, aiding communication between healthcare professionals. The goal of the MSE is to elicit the patient’s cur­rent psychopathology, that is, their abnormal sub­jective experiences, and an objective view of their mental state, including abnormal behaviour. It therefore includes both symptoms (what the pa­tient reports about current psychological symptoms, such as mood, thoughts, beliefs, abnormal percep­tions, cognitive function, etc.) and signs (what you observe about the patient’s behaviour during the interview). Inevitably, the MSE (i.e. now) merges at the edges with the history of the presenting problems (recently). Behavioural abnormalities which the pa­tient reports as still present, but which cannot be ob­served at interview (e.g. disturbed sleep, overeating, cutting) are part of the history of the presenting illness. A symptom which has resolved, such as an abnormal belief held last week but not today, should usually form part of the history, but will not be re­ported in the MSE. In contrast, an abnormal belief held last week which is still held today will be re­ported in both the history of the presenting prob­lems and the MSE. The components of the MSE are listed in Box 5.1. In taking the history, the interviewer will have learnt about the patient’s symptoms up to the time of the consultation. Often the clinical features on the day of the examination are no different from those described in the recent past, in which case the mental state will overlap with the recent history.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings, and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms seen in all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis rests on the identification of the specific features of particular disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of co-existing depressive symptoms, and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a course of individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, so it helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis.

      "title": "Dysautonomias: Clinical Disorders of the Autonomic Nervous System",
      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

Although the most important criterion for its diagnosis is spatial, distinguishing between neuralgia and other types of pain in the craniofacial area will only be possible by looking at a set of many clinical characteristics as a whole.Knowledge of the territories of sensory distribution of the nerves or roots is essential to be able to define the location of the pain in neuralgias. Other attributes are also useful for diagnosing them: the quality of the pain (paroxysmal, stinging-burning, dull), the time profile (seconds-minutes versus hours-days), the absence of accompanying phenomena other than certain manifestations of sensory dysfunction, especially in the symptomatic forms (hypoanaesthesia, paresthesias, dysesthesias, allodynia, hyperalgesia, hyperpathy), pain triggered by tactile or mechanical stimuli in the painful territory ('trigger' zones) or a positive Tinel's sign, the response to anaesthetic blockade of the nerve or root, and the response to certain drugs.Although trigeminal neuralgia is the most frequent, there are many other kinds of craniofacial neuralgias, in fact, theoretically, the total number is the same as the number of nerve roots and nerves responsible for the sensory innervation of these anatomical regions. It is essential to be familiar with them to obtain a correct diagnosis.",

The most common treatment methods for depression and anxiety are pharmacology, psychotherapy or a combination of both methods. The data from literature show that those treatment methods lead to an improvement of clinical symptoms, but they exert a possible impact on cognitive functions. However the study results referring both to the role of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy in this domain are still inconsistent. There is an increasing number of accessible data confirming the positive effects of those clinical interventions on cognitive functioning of anxiety and depressive patients, but the interpretation is complicated because of differences in methodology as well as examined sample size and their characteristics.

In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

Psychiatric collaboration in the diagnostic work-up is, then, highly desirable. Certain empirical and thematic psychological tests may provide further presumptive evidence for diagnosis. Although histrionic, repressive, and immature personality traits may tend to correlate with conversion reactions, they have not been found to be consistently associated and are, therefore, unreliable criteria for diagnosis.",

Evidence is presented to suggest that this association is not due to chance. The cerebral structural changes are characterized either by the presence of ‘focal’ lesions, e.g. multiple sclerosis, or by neuronal loss e.g. Huntington’s chorea. The probable mechanisms whereby these two types of structural changes effect psychiatric disturbances are discussed. It is inferred that psychiatric disturbances will occur insofar as these cerebral structural changes exert an influence on the limbic systems.",

There is no such thing as a non‐physical illness. Asking whether emotions cause diseases, or diseases cause emotions, leads to many difficulties and is unprofitable. It is far more useful to ask about stimulus‐response relationships. There are more kinds of specificity relations in psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine than are usually recognized, and the usual specificity statements in psychosomatic medicine are not concerned with I‐R or S‐R specificity. There are many problems in medicine which psychophysiology could help to solve.",

The complex faculty is taken to include orientation, attention, memory, language functions, gnosis, visual perception, comprehension, abstraction, reasoning, constructional praxis, judgement, and new learning. Definitions of dementia emphasize memory loss, the presence of other cognitive disturbances, a progressive course, and the presence of diffuse brain disease. Thus the DSM-IIIR criteria for probable Alzheimer’s disease require the presence of dementia; deficits in two or more areas of cognition; progression; normal consciousness; and the absence of other diagnosable pathologies. The diagnosis is supported by progressive deterioration of specific cognitive skills; impaired Activities of Daily Living and inappropriate behaviour; positive family history; normal cerebrospinal fluid; normal electro-encephalography (EEG) or non-specific changes only; and CT evidence of cerebral atrophy. But to require the absence of other pathologies begs the question as to the diagnosis and makes the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease one of exclusion. In this chapter, we will survey briefly those conditions which fulfil many of the criteria for Alzheimer’s disease but exhibit physical signs or other clinical features which disallow that diagnosis. As there are so many of them, those occurring less frequently are included in an appendix at the end of this chapter.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Pain and fatigue are commonly associated with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Occasionally these symptoms persist beyond a reasonable healing period. One potential explanation for prolonged symptom expression is the concurrent development of a stress‐mediated illness or CMI (Chronic Multi‐Symptom Illness). In such a scenario, the chronic regional pain and other symptoms that the individual is experiencing would be attributable to the CMI rather than to tissue damage or a biomechanical dysfunction of the upper‐extremity. Methods This article critically reviews the case definitions of the new class of CMI disorders and evaluates the existing evidence supporting centrally mediated physiological changes (e.g., sensory hypervigilance, dysautonomia) that manifest as symptoms of pain and fatigue in some individuals experiencing chronic stressors. Results While explanations for prolonged pain and fatigue have historically focused on mechanisms involving peripheral pathology or psychiatric explanations, ample evidences support the role of altered Central Nervous System function in accounting for symptom manifestation in CMI. Conclusions A model is presented that unites seemingly disparate findings across numerous investigations and provides a framework for understanding how genetics, triggering events, stressors, and early life events can affect CNS activity. Resultant symptom expression (e.g., pain and fatigue) from central dysregulation would be expected to occur in a subset of individuals in the population, including a subset of individuals with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Thus when symptoms such as pain and fatigue persist beyond a reasonable period, consideration of CMI and associated assessment and interventions focused on central mechanisms may be worthwhile. Am.

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Out of the two functions constituting male sexual functions, the reproductive and the coital one, the author has made a clinical study on the latter, that is, insufficiency and impotence in the narrow sense, which has hitherto been paid little scientific attention to. The sutudy has been on psychic impotence which accounts for the most part of clinical cases and on endocrine (androgen deficient) impotence which were found conciderable in frequency.(1) The author has defined impotence as the deficiency of one or two factors of sexual pattern, that is, sexual desire, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.(2) The author's causal classification of 130 cases he treated is as follows: -a) organic cause: -penile (malformation or disease) 1.5%: endocrine (pituitary, testicular, or adrenal deficiency) 21.5%: nervous (central or distal motility, or sensory nerve damage) 4.6%. b) functional cause: -psychic (psychological 8 cases, psychic 81 cases which is 62.3%) 68.5%. c) other causes (urological cause by the disease in the urethra, in the accessory sexual glands, or by operation or external injury, diabetes mellitus, chronic consumption, physiological defect) 3. 8%. It is notworthy that out of the urological out-patient the psychic cause accounts for more than 50%.(3) Various psychic causes inhibiting the male sexual pattern were the basic factors, as the authors calls, of psychic impotence and the classification of 89 cases he treated is as follows: -sexual organ inferiority 6 cases, new marital condition 23 cases, abnormal sexual behavior 16 cases, disease anxiety or fear of disease 24 cases, suppression from the wife 3 cases, fear of conception 1 case, subconscious homosexuality 1 case, neurosis sign 8 cases, and unknown 5 cases.(4) The classification by age groups of psychic impotence is as follows: -the young group below 30 years old 45 cases, the prime-of-life group between 30 to 40 years old 18 cases, the more elderly and old age group 26 cases.(5) The author found that there was a characteristic difference between the basic factor of the young-group psychic impotence and that of the elderly-and-old-age-groups psychic impotence. The formation process of psychic impotence was that it originated from the individual's unconscious fear, doubt, anxiety, inhibitory idea about his own sexual function.(6) The treatment of psychic impotence was conducted primarily by psychotherapy through the interview at a regular interval and secondarily by medical therapy as a kind of trigger to cure. This method was sufficient and the most suitable even for a urologist.(7) The author's therapeutic result was that, out of 19 cases of new-marital impotence which is typical of young-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 2 cases unsuccessful, and uncertain of result 7 cases: and that, out of 22 cases of elderly-and-old-age-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 5 cases improved, 7 cases uncertain.(8) Endocrine impotence he treated was 28 cases and the classification of factors were that 17 cases were counted for the upper-central-nervous disorder, out of which 13 cases eunuchoidism: testicular disorders were 11 cases, out of which 8 cases post-pubertal castration, and 3 cases testicular atrophy.(9) The characteristic features of sexual pattern in endocrine impotence were that sexual desire generally declined, erotic erection and reflexible erection were damaged to various degrees, ejaculation decreasing and orgasm weakened.(10) Sexual function of castrate could be maintened and kept under control by supplying him with androgen. The author made investigation on the most efficacious method for it.",

Las manifestaciones clínicas son muy variables; pueden ser reactivas a un estrés cerebral transitorio, a lesiones permanentes, o bien, formar parte de un síndrome neurológico más amplio, denominado síndrome epiléptico. Las crisis convulsivas pueden ser parciales o focales (simples, complejas y con evolución a generalizadas) y generalizadas (ausencias, mioclonías, tónicas, clónicas, tónicoclónicas y atónicas). Su fisiopatología se sintetiza en una hiperexcitablilidad neuronal ocasionada por un aumento en las respuestas glutaminérgicas y una inhibición de las respuestas GABAérgicas, ocasionando un desbalance en el impulso neuronal del sistema nervioso central. Los medicamentos anticonvulsivantes tienen sus dianas farmacológicas en diferentes canales iónicos y moléculas sinápticas que interfieren en las respuestas excitatorias e inhibitorias del impulso nervioso, equilibrando así la excitabilidad nerviosa y permitiendo la mejoría clínica del paciente.",

Primary symptoms are those that are a direct result of CNS damage, such as fatigue, bladder dysfunction, visual disturbances, incoordination or imbalance, etc. Secondary symptoms are complications arising from these symptoms such as falls due to imbalance, spasticity or weakness, or UTI due to bladder retention. Tertiary symptoms are the social and vocational consequences of primary and secondary symptoms and can include divorce, job loss, financial hardship, and social isolation. Careful evaluation of these symptoms along with appropriate treatment and long-term follow-up can contribute to the quality of life for patients with MS.",

      "title": "The Contribution of Demoralization to End of Life Decisionmaking",
      "abstract": "Some psychiatrists believe that syndrome is a diagnosable cognitive disorder characterized in its extreme form by morbid existential distress. If they are right, then it should be an important part of our thinking about end of life decisionmaking. A demoralized patient would be unable to think reliably about the remainder of her life, and therefore incompetent to decide to commit physician-assisted suicide. The pointlessness of a wretched existence, in which meaning and purpose are lost and despair is pervasive, can lead to a wish to die. This mental state may develop in association with the suffering of the chronically medically ill and of the dying. Should a plea to hasten dying be viewed as a rational request for merciful assistance, or is it symptomatic of a suicidal mind disordered through illness and warranting a therapeutic response? Out of the clinical and ethical debates about end of life decisionmaking, a fundamental question has arisen: is demoralization no more than a comprehensible human and emotional response to a state of dire bodily disease, or can it be a pathological process deserving of diagnosis as illness? In this paper, I explore demoralization as a dimensional state of mind--that is, as a mental state ranging from a normal response to perceived helplessness to a morbid form of existential distress. The impact of demoralization upon a person's capacity to give informed consent across a range of end-of-life decisions is a pivotal question. Demoralization influences a person's assumptive world and may, as I shall show, interfere with his appreciation of clinical data pertinent to decisionmaking. Clinical and legislative implications arise when severe demoralization is recognized as a morbid state of mind. Acceptance of Dying No argument exists concerning the capacity of people to accept rationally the reality of their death. Indeed, sociologists have described this as a quest of the modern palliative care movement: to help patients face their dying with open awareness and courage, the 'ideal' of a heroic death in the supportive care of their family, friends, and community. (1) This acceptance of dying is commonly identifiable within the narrative of many patients, especially the very elderly, as they anticipate what their future might hold. The following clinical account helps to illustrate their mental state. Giuseppe, a married, seventy-five-year-old Italian, suffering from lung cancer and recurrent chest infections, caused his oncologist concern when he expressed a wish to die. He appeared very sad as he spoke of his limited future, his frustration at a considerably restricted exercise tolerance, and the boredom that set in at home. He was the youngest of three children born to a farming family in Northern Italy, his education cut short by the onset of World War II when he was just fourteen. After serving in the army, Giuseppe traveled to France where he married and fathered two daughters. In the 1960s, the family migrated to Australia, where Giuseppe worked as a leading hand in the building industry until retirement a decade ago. He was proud of the respect he had earned for his contribution to the workplace, and especially of his family--the very best! He delighted in completing the crossword puzzle daily. While volunteering an acceptance of his diagnosis, he described waves of sadness that came over him when he thought about his life ending. Yet when conversing more generally, he was interactive, spontaneous, could share a joke, and his mood was dearly reactive to the environmental context. His interest in sport and classical movies sustained his enjoyment of life. There was no hint of a clinical depression. Acknowledging that his health was considerably compromised, he explained that he did not want to go on living with illness. He stated, My chest is no good at all. I don't know about my future. …",

      "title": "Primary or secondary? What came first and how to treat?",
      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Schizophrenia patients exhibit widespread deficits in many domains, ranging from abnormalities in preattentional sensory processing to gross impairments in everyday functioning. Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential measure that occurs in the absence of directed attention. While many studies have reported MMN deficits in schizophrenia patients, little is known about the functional significance of MMN deficits in schizophrenia patients. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine if a schizophrenia-linked deficit in MMN, an \"automatic\" preattentional measure, is associated with impairments in everyday functional status, level of independence in living situation, and the ability to perform tasks routinely encountered in everyday situations. <h3>Setting and Participants</h3> Twenty-five patients with a<i>DSM-IV</i>diagnosis of schizophrenia recruited from inpatient and outpatient community facilities affiliated with the University of California, San Diego, and 25 healthy, nonpsychiatric, comparison subjects. <h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3> Mismatch negativity, clinical symptoms, performance on a multidimensional laboratory-based functional skills assessment battery, clinician ratings on the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and level of independence in community living situation. <h3>Results</h3> Schizophrenia patients had significantly reduced MMN (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Greater levels of MMN impairment were associated with lower Global Assessment of Functioning Scale ratings. Consistent with clinical ratings, patients with greater MMN impairments were more likely to live in highly structured vs independent settings. A regional analysis of MMN revealed that the largest correlations of MMN to everyday functioning were present at frontocentral recording sites (eg,<i>r</i><sub>s</sub> = −0.65). In contrast, MMN deficits were not associated with symptom severity or performance on laboratory-based tasks measuring skills that are often considered necessary for independent living. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This pattern of results suggests that MMN deficits represent a core neurophysiological dysfunction that is linked to global impairments in everyday functioning in schizophrenia patients. These deficits in automatic preattentive information processing account for up to 42% of the variance in global functional status in schizophrenia patients. Thus, basic preattentional cognitive deficits may be excellent measures for predicting functional outcome. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the relationships between deficits in automatic sensory information processing, associated neural substrate dysfunctions, and deficits in everyday functioning across the course of the illness.",

O termo Esquizofrenia se refere a um grupo de transtornos caracterizados por sintomas psicóticos positivos em algum estágio da doença, em que mania e depressão grave não são características proeminentes ou persistentes, e onde sintomas negativos e cognitivos são proeminentes e associados a um nível variável de incapacidade (McGorry, 2004). Este diagnóstico compreende um grupo heterogêneo de transtornos psicóticos, que resultam, provavelmente, de alterações neurobiológicas substanciais na função cerebral e em algum grau na estrutura cerebral do indivíduo. Originado do conceito kraepeliniano de demência precoce, seu significado sofreu modificações com o desenvolvimento de novas nosologias (McGorry, 2004). Entretanto, apesar da tentativa de unificar as várias apresentações do transtorno, o curso da esquizofrenia revelou-se heterogêneo e notavelmente diferente de quadros neurológicos mais bem tipificados, como a Doença de Alzheimer. O tratamento dessa condição, muitas vezes, pode ser desafiador, o que demanda do psiquiatra uma adaptação às especificidades de cada caso.

The author suggests that the clinician address the underlying pathophysiology through a treatment intervention that addresses the overarching psychiatric disorder. Generally, agents that reduce dopaminergic or noradrenergic tone or increase serotonergic or GABAergic tone will attenuate agitation, often irrespective of etiology.",

Negative phenomena comprise the amusias, which can be receptive, expressive, or both, and can selectively involve particular components of musical processing, including pitch, interval, contour, rhythm, meter, timbre, and emotional response. Amusia is often accompanied by aphasia, but each can occur in the absence of the other.

A disfunção sexual consiste na incapacidade para participar do ato sexual com satisfação, comprometendo desejo e/ou excitação e/ou orgasmo. Pode também se apresentar como dor que antecede, ocorre durante ou após o ato. Os numerosos fatores de risco para a disfunção sexual explicam sua alta prevalência nas diferentes fases da vida, podendo apresentar etiologia orgânica, psicossocial e/ou sociodemográfica. Entre estes últimos citam-se idade avançada, renda familiar baixa e educação precária. Quanto aos fatores orgânicos, encontram-se: deficiência hormonal, hipertensão arterial, diabetes, cardiopatias, neuropatias, alcoolismo, tabagismo, uso de drogas ilícitas, bem como uso de alguns medicamentos. Depressão e ansiedade respondem pelas causas psiquiátricas mais comuns de disfunção sexual. A prevalência é alta em homens, especialmente nos casos de disfunção erétil (DE) e de ejaculação precoce (EP). O mesmo se observa nas mulheres, quanto à diminuição do desejo, falta de lubrificação vaginal, transtornos do orgasmo e dor ao intercurso sexual. Por comprometer a satisfação sexual e a satisfação com a vida, a disfunção sexual resulta em menor qualidade de vida, baixa autoestima, depressão, ansiedade e prejuízo na relação interpessoal e dos parceiros. Doenças crônicas podem conduzir ao desinteresse sexual e à falta dessa atividade, por baixa autoestima e preocupação quanto à imagem corporal, por exemplo. A depressão também reduz a libido, deteriorando a qualidade do relacionamento sexual. Os pacientes, ansiosos sobre sua habilidade em satisfazer o parceiro, com o tempo desenvolvem ansiedade antecipatória e, pelo receio de falhar, acabam evitando o intercurso. Fadiga e estresse também acompanham as doenças crônicas, podendo contribuir para a disfunção sexual.",

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms : characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both.\r\n\r\nNegative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience.\r\n\t\r\nHowever, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. \r\n\r\nThis chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction or substance-use disorder is a chronically relapsing disorder that progresses through binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect and preoccupation/anticipation stages. These stages represent diverse neurobiological mechanisms that are differentially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use and from positive to negative reinforcement. The progression from recreational to compulsive substance use is associated with downregulation of the brain reward systems and upregulation of the brain stress systems. Individual differences in the neurobiological systems that underlie the processing of reward, incentive salience, habits, stress, pain, and executive function may explain (i) the vulnerability to substance-use disorder; (ii) the diversity of emotional, motivational, and cognitive profiles of individuals with substance-use disorders; and (iii) heterogeneous responses to cognitive and pharmacological treatments. Characterization of the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie individual differences in addiction-like behaviors is the key to understanding the mechanisms of addiction and development of personalized pharmacotherapy.",

The presence of psychotic features has a profound influence on the course and treatment response of mood disorders, and psychotic disorders in turn are influenced by coexisting dysregulation of mood. Psychosis and mood, along with other features such as severity, a high rate of recurrence, psychomotor changes, dissociation, and mental states reflecting a history of trauma, appear to interact to alter each other's expression. The treatment of psychotic mood disorders, regardless of coexisting conditions, requires pharmacotherapy--usually a combination of an antipsychotic drug and a medication for mood--or electroconvulsive therapy. The results of treatment are usually positive.",

      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

      "title": "MASGUTOVA METHOD OF REFLEX INTEGRATION FOR CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY",
      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

It is concluded that: (i) Differences in the clinical status of the schizophrenic subjects and whether they were receiving medication, but not the method used to measure aftereffects, may underlie the interstudy disagreements. (ii) The effect of schizophrenia is to increase MAE duration, and this is not due to some peripheral artefact.

The five axes are mental disorders; personality and mental disorders; general medical conditions; psychosocial and environmental problems, and global assessment of functioning (GAF) scale. Psychosocial and environmental problems may affect diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mental disorders; the problems or stressors can contribute to the development of a mental disorder or can be the result of a mental disorder. The multiaxial assessment process should result in the following; documentation of the primary and any secondary mental and behavioral disorders; definition of physical disorders that may be present and indication if they are related to or influence the mental and behavioral disorders; identification of environmental stressors that may affect, contribute to, complicate, or exacerbate the mental and behavioral disorder; and a rating of the person's psychological, social, and occupational functioning. A table shows the GAF scale (ratings by deciles from 1 to 100; higher numbers indicate fewer problems) and does not include impairments that result from physical or environmental limitations.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

      "title": "Happiness and neurological diseases",
      "abstract": "Happiness is an emotional state reflecting positive feelings and satisfaction with life, which, as an outcome in disease states or as an end point in clinical trials, is a neglected concept in most therapeutic areas. In neurological disease, happiness is important as it can be diminished either as a direct result of damage to neuronal tissue or as a reaction to a poor prognosis. The monitoring and maintenance of happiness and wellbeing have historically been considered to be peripheral to medicine. However, as happiness interacts with the patient’s physical health, it is an important parameter to assess alongside all aspects of any given disease. Happiness provides a reliable overview of the patient’s general status over and above standard parameters for quality of life, and is more wide-ranging than the narrow measures of disease activity or treatment efficacy that are the focus of most clinical trials. In many studies, happiness has been associated with health and success in most areas of life, including performance at work, sporting achievement and social functioning. For approximately a decade, previously studied aspects of psychology have been grouped under the label of positive psychology (PoP). Principles of this discipline are now being used to guide some treatments in neurological and psychiatric diseases. PoP aims to define patient wellbeing in scientific terms and to increase understanding of happiness, meaning in life, resilience and character strengths, as well as to determine how this knowledge can be applied clinically to promote health. Some evidence has emerged recently suggesting that improvements in patient status can result from interventions to improve the patient’s level of happiness in diseases, including epilepsy, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and stroke. Several effective approaches to increase happiness employ activities to engage and stimulate patients who might otherwise be unoccupied and isolated. In addition, specific interventions to increase happiness developed by PoP clinicians have demonstrated efficacy and validity. Several measurement scales now exist that reliably measure happiness as a long-term state, rather than as a fluctuating condition resulting from prevailing mood. These enable the use of happiness as an end point in clinical trials. As happiness becomes increasingly accepted as an important consideration in neurological disease, it is likely to be monitored more extensively, with measures to raise happiness levels being taken as an effective means of improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

The chapter clearly outlines the nosology of these disorders and the reason for their grouping. Provided is a thorough description of the definition, diagnosis, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, course, natural history, prognosis, and treatment for somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, and somatoform disorder, not otherwise specified.",

Ces alterations peuvent trouver leurs origines dans des atteintes primaires de la fonction neuromusculaire et/ou des atteintes secondaires causees par exemple, par une diminution de l'activite spontanee favorisee par une pathologie chronique. Ainsi, la faiblesse et la fatigabilite musculaire sont des symptomes tres frequemment rapportes dans les maladies neuromusculaires (myopathies/neuropathies d'origine genetique ou acquise), les pathologies impliquant le systeme cardiovasculaire (insuffisance cardiaque) et/ou respiratoire (broncho-pneumopathie chronique obstructive (BPCO)). Ces symptomes sont aussi frequemment associes aux syndromes idiopathiques de douleurs chroniques accompagnees d'anomalies de la nociception (syndrome fibromyalgique). Le developpement d'outils d'evaluation bien toleres et fiables de la force, de l'endurance et de la fatigue neuromusculaire est d'une importance cruciale pour approfondir la comprehension des mecanismes physiopathologiques et pour disposer de criteres de jugement de qualite dans le cadre d'etudes observationnelles et interventionnelles. Dans ce contexte, la stimulation artificielle electrique s'est revelee etre un outil performant pour evaluer in situ la fonction musculaire chez l'humain au repos et au cours de l'exercice. Plus specifiquement, la stimulation magnetique des troncs nerveux peripheriques a montre des predispositions interessantes pour l'evaluation de la fonction des muscles locomoteurs et respiratoires dans le cadre clinique. Au cours de ce travail, nous avons developpe des outils d'evaluation de la force, de l'endurance et de la fatigue neuromusculaire en utilisant la neurostimulation magnetique et des protocoles d'exercice potentiellement applicables chez le patient. Nous avons etudie leurs capacites a detecter des differences liees au sexe, l'âge et au statut d'entrainement. Dans un second temps, nous avons applique nos evaluations dans le cadre de maladies neuromusculaires et de syndromes douloureux chroniques. Chez le patient BPCO, nous avons etudie les phenomenes de fatigue des muscles respiratoires et locomoteurs, leur impact sur la reponse a l'effort ainsi que leurs relations entre eux et avec les symptomes percus. Chez ces patients, nous avons recherche les effets d'un entraiment d'une prise en charge combinant un entrainement des muscles locomoteurs et un entrainement des muscles respiratoires sur ces parametres.",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

This chapter describes the mental phenomena prior to their becoming part of the formulation of particular disorders, but for convenience and coherence some common syndromes, such as mania, are used to draw together the associated phenomena. A hierarchy moving from feelings through emotions, moods, and affective state to temperament involves increasing complexity in terms of state of mind and usually to an increasing duration of that state. Delusion involves abnormal beliefs that arise in the context of disturbed judgements and an altered experience of reality. Depersonalisation and derealisation are assumed to arise from a disruption in the functions of consciousness to create amnesia, dissociative identity disorder and depersonalisation disorder.

Negative or deficit symptoms are often associated with inferior social/instrumental functioning premorbidly, more abnormal voluntary/involuntary movements at illness presentation, and poorer long-term outcome when present beyond the early phase of illness. Negative symptoms are semi-independent of positive symptoms. They are variable early in the illness but accrue in severity, stability, and prognostic weight with time. The nature of the processes that generate negative symptoms and their specificity to schizophrenia remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, it is clear that negative symptoms are a common and valid component of schizophrenia and deserve recognition as such in our nosology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The first part of this two-part series discusses psychological influences in delayed and failed recovery and resulting unnecessary work disability; the second part discusses theoretical and practical aspects of the issue, including evaluation and treatment. Delayed and failed recovery and unnecessary disability (DFRUD) refers to a lag in, or lack of, expected recovery from a medical condition and/or unnecessary resultant disability. Causation is complex, and we are not doing well at managing this group of workers using a biomedical model. The traditional biomedical model posits that disease or injury produces symptoms and signs that cause impairment and result in disability. This approach too strictly separates mental phenomena and bodily function (Cartesian dualism) and leads to scientific reductionism when actually six domains are active in worker disability: medical, personal, psychological, sociocultural, systematic (including compensation and insurance), and workplace elements. Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) should be understood as a disturbance of normal neurological and/or psychological processes underlying symptom production, perception, and experience and cannot be better explained by another physical or psychiatric illness. Within this system of evaluation, administrative and medical iatrogenicity are associated with unnecessary medical care and poor outcomes for individuals. In addition to determining industrial causality and apportionment, if evaluators accept some psychological factors, MUPS, and central sensitization, they must explain to what extent these are compensable. Part two of this article will discuss theoretical and practical approaches, including specific evaluation and treatment methods.",

Despite specific phenotypical differences determining the diagnostic and classification belongings there are a lot of similarities or common elements between both groups of disorders. Special stress was put on the bioelectrical background or phenomena accompanying epilepsy and depression. Current knowledge about biochemical and structural background of depression is wide and enough well recognized. In contrast, studies on bioelectric conditions of depressive disorders are quite poor, despite the fact that the bioelectric phenomena are--beside biochemical processes--the immanent feature of nervous cells. Currently--apart from the kindling phenomenon--there is a lack of theories or hypotheses trying to explain the origin of depression (affective disorders) with perturbation of bioelectrical functions in neurons. Certain bioelectrical phenomena accompanying the different forms of antidepressant therapy (e.g. changing in the threshold level) are recognized as accidental side effects or not possessing the clinical meaning. The analysis conducted shows a necessity of intensifying experimental and clinical investigations over explaining the usefulness of the electric phenomena in the pathomechanism of depressive disorders.",

      "title": "Neurobiological evidence for epilepsy-induced interictal disturbances.",
      "abstract": "It is not in the best interest of persons with epilepsy to deny the possibility that seizures could cause enduring behavioral disturbances. Rather, it is essential to pursue clinical and animal investigations in order to identify any such changes that might occur and to elucidate their mechanisms. Many testable hypotheses can be developed from existing evidence. Antiepileptic medication may produce interictal behavioral disturbances in patients with epilepsy by indirect mechanisms. Some aberrant behaviors could be due to medication-induced systemic disorders, neuroendocrine dysfunction, or REM deficit, whereas depression following successful treatment with drugs, as well as with surgery, may be related more specifically to cessation of seizures. The underlying neuropathological process also induces neurological and mental deficits, but it is not always possible to differentiate those behavioral disturbances due to destructive effects of the lesion from those due to recurrent epileptic seizures. Behavioral disturbances are associated more frequently with epileptogenic lesions in limbic structures than with those elsewhere in the brain, but a relationship between hemispheric lateralization of the epileptogenic lesion and specific interictal behavioral symptoms remains controversial. When considering the effects of seizures per se on interictal behavior, it is important to realize that some \"interictal\" behavioral disturbances may actually be ictal events. Prolonged affective, autonomic, and psychic disturbances can occur in clear consciousness with unilateral limbic seizures that are not associated with scalp EEG changes. When epilepsy is acquired as a result of cerebral damage, the epileptogenic process takes time to develop before spontaneous seizures appear. It is more reasonable to assume that this progressive process continues than to postulate that it stops completely at the time the first seizure occurs. Epilepsy-induced protective homeostatic mechanisms that act to terminate ictal events, prevent ictal spread, and maintain the interictal state may also disrupt interictal function. Furthermore, seizures could indirectly influence interictal behavior as a result of their effects on neuroendocrine function and sleep. Because of confounding biological factors, it is difficult to document the association of any epilepsy disorder, by itself, with progressive behavioral disturbances in humans. Secondary epileptogenesis, protective homeostatic mechanisms, and epilepsy-induced disturbances in development can be readily demonstrated, however, in experimental animal models. In experimental animals, endogenous opoids are released during seizures and mediate some postictal behaviors. A physiological dependency on high levels of endogenous opioids released during seizures could produce depression as a withdrawal symptom interictally or when seizures no longer occur as a result of successful therapy. Experimental animal models of depression exist to test hypotheses concerning pro- and antidepressant effects of epileptogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "One of your patients, a 24 year old student, has recently recovered from a first episode of functional psychosis. At a pre-discharge meeting with the patient and his relatives, they inquire about the long term outcome, in particular about the chances of a recurrence in the next few years.\n\n“Prognosis” concerns the prediction of future events. The main form of the prognostic question is usually “what is the likelihood of this particular outcome in a patient with this disorder?” In mental health, prognostic questions may be about the medium to long term outcome of an illness—or they may be about the short term likelihood of a serious adverse event—for example, homicide or suicide. We may also ask if there are any characteristics of the patient that make it more likely that they will have a particularly good or bad outcome. These prognostic factors can be demographic (eg, age or sex), disease specific (presentation and symptomatology), or the presence of other conditions (comorbidity).1 Prognostic factors are distinguished from risk factors for the disease because they are determinants of what will happen after development of the illness rather than deteminants of whether the patient will develop the disorder.\n\nTreatment is one form of prognostic factor, although a special form in that it can be manipulated to improve the likelihood of a beneficial outcome. The fact that treatment can be manipulated also means that it can be studied experimentally in randomised controlled trials. It is either impossible or unethical, however, to randomise most prognostic factors, and therefore alternative study designs are required. The aim of the alternative study design is the same as a randomised trial—that is, to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect of the prognostic factor. When randomisation is not possible, a cohort study is usually the most reliable …",

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychiatric complication associated with pregnancy and childbirth with debilitating symptoms that negatively impact the quality of life of the mother as well as inflict potentially long-lasting developmental impairments to the child. Much of the theoretical pathophysiology put forth to explain the emergence of PPD overlaps with that of major depressive disorder (MDD) and, although not conventionally described in such terms, can be seen as neurodegenerative in nature. Framing the disorder from the perspective of the well-established inflammatory theory of depression, symptoms are thought to be driven by dysregulation, and subsequent hyperactivation of the body's immune response to stress. Compounded by physiological stressors such as drastic fluctuations in hormone signaling, physical and psychosocial stressors placed upon new mothers lay bare a number of significant vulnerabilities, or points of potential failure, in systems critical for maintaining healthy brain function. The inability to compensate or properly adapt to meet the changing demands placed upon these systems has the potential to damage neurons, hinder neuronal growth and repair, and disrupt neuronal circuit integrity such that essential functional outputs like mood and cognition are altered. The impact of this deterioration in brain function, which includes depressive symptoms, extends to the child who relies on the mother for critical life-sustaining care as well as important cognitive stimulation, accentuating the need for further research.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

Other aspects of personality are best understood as traits, rather than “disorders,” or as symptomatic changes that are acute and occur lower in the hierarchy of diagnosis than mood or psychotic states, and are caused by the latter. The common report of purported comorbidity is seen as an overestimation, with personality changes often being part of other conditions.

      "abstract": "Résumé La découverte d'une chimiothérapie antidépressive a eu, sur le plan theorique, des conséquences qui n'étaient pas apparues avec celle des neuroleptiques et des tranquillisants. Le terme meme d'antidepresseur le souligne. Il s'agit en effet d'une classe de molécules qui agissent sur un ensemble de comportements définis et sur eux seuls. La question demeure ouverte de savoir comment les modifications neurophysiologiques obtenues par ces molecules agissent sur le comportement. Le fait que nous n'ayons pas une réponse précise à cette question explique sans doute la part importante de la resistance que Ton rencontre encore dans la prescription des antidepresseurs. On ne retrouve pas ce fait pour les neuroleptiques et les tranquillisants, bien que ces derniers présentent des effets secondaires plus nocifs (dyskinésie ou troubles mnésiques par exemple). Une première erreur consiste à confondre cause et mécanisme. Ce n'est pas parce que la chimiotherapie depressive agit sur la symptomatologie que le déficit qu'elle corrige est nécessairement, et encore moins uniquement, la cause de survenue de cet etat. En ce qui concerne les causes, nous devons conserver un point de vue pluraliste et uniciste à la fois en considerant qu'il s'agit d'une «maladie» pluri-factorielle. En termes de mécanisme, notre pensee doit demeurer resolument dualiste et reconnaftre un principe de parallélisme entre événements neurophysiologiques et événements comportementaux. La seconde erreur consiste à confondre liaison synaptique avec le concept classique de centre nerveux. Un exemple de cette confusion nous est peut-être donné par la recherche, jusqu'à présent stérile, de dépressions «noradrénergique» ou «sérotoninergique». Il est fort possible que les molécules dont nous disposons agissent sur des rélais dans un reseau de neurones qui sont impliqués dans les mécanismes comportementaux. La troisième erreur porte sur la manière dont nous traitons l'analyse comportementale de la dépression en se référant à une sémiologie qui a été construite à des fins tout-à-fait différentes (diagnostic d'une maladie et prévision de son évolution). Une analyse comportementale qui voudrait cerner de plus près l'action des molécules devrait renoncer à cette sémiologie et dégager des traits de comportement directement sensibles à l'action des medicaments. A la notion trop vague et trop globale de trouble de l'humeur, il serait sans doute utile de substituer celle de système ou plan d'action et de mecanisme d'interruption ou de ralentissement de l'exécution de ces plans.",

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

      "title": "Multiple Chemical Sensitivities: Psychogenic or Toxicodynamic Origins",
      "abstract": "The multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) phenomenon can cause significant dysfunction and symptomatology and presents a difficult challenge for patient management. Central to the MCS debate is whether this phenomenon results from a primary emotional response to perceived chemical exposures or from pathological interactions between chemicals and biological systems. Those who believe the latter argue that toxic interactions result in physiological impairment and that subsequent emotional problems derive from such impairment. Distinguishing between psychogenic (emotional) or a toxicodynamic (chemical toxicity) origin is essential to the medical management of an MCS patient. A psychogenic basis requires treatment with appropriate behavioral therapies; in contrast, a belief in a strictly toxicodynamic etiology argues for avoidance and often precludes treatments that address the psychological responses. Current scientific evidence strongly suggests that behavioral or psychogenic explanations predominate for reported MCS symptoms. Acceptance of a purely toxic origination (i.e., pathological abnormalities result from a low level chemical exposure) defies known toxicological and medical principles; whereas psychogenic explanations are consistent with these principles. Because symptoms are the end points of many diseases with many causes, both physical and emotional, modern medicine is charged with and expected to consider both when treating MCS patients. The argument can be made that insufficient information exists about the causal nature of many diseases, and future research may provide support for a strict toxicodynamic cause. However, the practice of medicine must be based upon current knowledge, not future possibilities. Proper care of MCS patients requires identifying the existence of both psychological and organic pathological dysfunction. The rejection of a psychological aspect of the MCS phenomenon and appropriate behavioral treatments is both illogical and detrimental to MCS sufferers.",

Whether bipolar depression or general depression, whether accompanied with or without psychotic symptoms, or with or without cognitive impairment, there are clinical and possible biological differences in these depressions, which indicates that different subtypes of depression represented by different TCM syndromes not only are different clinical syndromes, but also imply that there may be some biomarkers. The melancholia with liver depression and stagnation is different from melancholia with deficiency of both heart and spleen in clinical symptoms, which may indicate that there are differences in some potential biological biomarkers. For example, central nervous transmitters, trace elements, electrophysiology, neuroendocrinology, brain imaging, and even genomics may differ among different TCM syndrome types of depression, which not only serves for the modernization of TCM, but also finds biological differences for different TCM syndrome types of depression.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

This is because no pathobiological foundation for such classification is demonstrated--no matter how thoroughly the patients are examined, or how long they are followed up. Symptomatologically too, organic and non-organic conditions are distinctive. While organic illnesses are characterized by physical and biochemical signs, non-organic disorders manifest only distressing experiences (as pains or anxiety) or undesirable behaviour (as abuse of alcohol)--phenomena that are inseparable from normal sensation, emotion, intentions and actions. As for treatment, the main methods applied in organic illnesses are of a physical and biochemical nature. In cases of subjective suffering or behavioural deviances therapy consists of general relief, correction and sedation--all of the kind we make use of in our everyday lives. If the majority of those who consult a doctor are not really ill, what then, is the alternative? Individual and collective misery? The sole alternative to illness is normal psycho-physiological and behavioural variations. A widely held opinion, however, is that non-organic disorders fulfill the criteria for illness. This means that some kind of pathological substrate is postulated even when we fail to demonstrate its existence. The crucial point, however, is not to solve the problem of whether a person is ill or not, but to underline that we are dealing with two separate categories of phenomena - bio-pathologically and psycho-physiologically founded suffering and dysfunctioning.",

      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "While pain has traditionally been understood within a medical model that equates pain to tissue damage or disease, this understanding is not consistent with everyday observations of pain or with clinical examples of persistent pain where there is often very little correlation between pain experienced and physical findings. This article considers psychological and multidimensional theories of pain, which are described within the historical context within which they were developed, including behavioural, cognitive, contextual and functional theories. Research into the multifactorial nature of persistent pain has tended to focus on mechanisms of pain development and maintenance or on the function of pain. Psychological approaches, which have focused on mechanism traditionally use disability, mood and quality of life measures to assess outcome, claiming little or no impact on pain intensity itself. By contrast, functional approaches include an explicit goal of reducing pain intensity, which is therefore measured as a key treatment outcome. Strong evidence exists from a range of sources of the important contribution of psychological and social factors to the experience of pain. However, evidence is still lacking about the specific mechanisms of change that are targeted by biopsychosocial interventions and about what treatment approach is likely to work best for whom.",

      "abstract": "Stroke can have many different effects on patients' mood, cognitions, and behaviour. The emotional outcome most often associated with stroke is depression (or depressed mood), and its frequency after stroke has led some to suggest that post-stroke depression is a distinct type. The increased recognition of mood disorders, behavioural changes, and cognitive impairment and their effects on patients, has resulted in the development of new interventions, a greater number of professionals skilled to intervene, and increased research evidence on intervention effectiveness. Psychological disorder and distress continue to be under-recognised, some disorders are incorrectly diagnosed and treated, and the relative lack of a research base means that nurses and doctors may be treating disorders in their patients without much certainty about the effectiveness of the interventions. Models of coping theories can help to explain patients' reactions.",

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness has a multitude of causes. Some involve genetic or metabolic disturbances affecting the muscle directly, some are caused by interruptions to the transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction, still others by abnormalities in the muscle nerve supply. Disuse atrophy with profound weakness may be seen in advanced arthritis or in any other condition where chronic pain enforces immobility. There are numerous uncommon syndromes in which muscle weakness is an important component; many of these will come to a specialist neurologist for elucidation. Some weakness is temporary, recovery of strength often occurs in stroke or very commonly in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Cranial motor and peripheral muscular dysfunction in myasthenia gravis may respond to steroids, immuno-suppressants and either plasma exchange or immunoglobulin infusions as well as thymectomy and the use of pyridostigmine. There are presentations of ‘functional’ weakness (often unilateral and sometimes accompanied by sensory symptoms) commonly of prolonged duration, that are little altered by treatment of any kind, but are not readily assigned to any recognizable neurological diagnosis. This group of disorders reminds us that weakness is a subjective as well an objective and measurable symptom.",

      "title": "The Neurotoxicity of Drugs Given Intrathecally (Spinal)",
      "abstract": "A growing understanding of the neuropharmacology of spinal cord processing of nociceptive input has led to intense interest in the use of spinal drugs in anesthesia and pain management. The direct application of receptor-specific therapeutics at the spinal cord can potentially interrupt specific pain pathways and limit systemic side effects, but this practice also carries the inherent risk of injury to the central nervous system. Thus, the neurotoxicity of spinal drugs is a central safety issue. Spinal cord or nerve root toxicity may manifest itself as histologic, physiologic, or behavioral/clinical derangements after exposure to a spinal drug. Neurohistopathology is broadly classified as neural injury, gliosis, or damage to the myelin sheath, and it also describes inflammatory changes and involvement of the arachnoid cell layers. Physiologic neurotoxicity of spinal drugs includes changes in spinal cord blood flow, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and changes in the electrophysiology of impulse conduction. Behavioral and clinical signs of neurotoxicity include pain, motor and sensory deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Ideally, a complete roster of histological, physiologic, and behavioral testing would be performed on spinal drugs in several animal species, followed by safety trials in humans before widespread use. In practice, drugs have taken a variety of roads from conception to application, and often without safety data. In this article, we review available neurotoxicity data on drugs that have a clinical application, classified as spinal local anesthetics, spinal analgesics, or spinal adjuvants. Spinal Local Anesthetics The 100-yr history of spinal local anesthetic use in humans has typically involved self-experimentation, followed by widespread application with little or no controlled testing for neurotoxicity. Bier and Hildebrant [1] initially performed spinal anesthesia with cocaine on themselves in 1898, and essentially all of the earliest local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia were introduced in this fashion without toxicity studies. Despite a long history of clinical use, recent interest in neurotoxicity has arisen due to concerns over reports of cauda equina syndrome and transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) from spinal local anesthetics. We review animal data that have been used to assess the neurotoxicity of local anesthetics and summarize data available from human studies. In 1985, Ready et al. [2] evaluated the neurotoxic effects of single injections of local anesthetics in rabbits. They reported that spinal cord histopathology remained normal and that persistent neurologic deficits were not seen with clinically used concentrations of tetracaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, or chlorprocaine. However, histopathologic changes and neurologic deficits did occur with higher concentrations of tetracaine (1%) and lidocaine (8%). In this model, extensive neurologic impairment was not necessarily accompanied by equally extensive lesions in the spinal cord and nerve roots, thus demonstrating the need for multiple models to fully assess neurotoxicity. Recent studies have used desheathed peripheral nerve models, designed to mimic unprotected nerve roots in the cauda equina, to further assess electrophysiologic neurotoxicity of clinically relevant concentrations of local anesthetics [3-5]. These models demonstrate that clinically used concentrations of 5% lidocaine and 0.5% tetracaine cause irreversible conduction block, whereas 1.5% lidocaine, 0.75% bupivacaine, and 0.06% tetracaine do not. Electrophysiologic toxicity of lidocaine in these models is concentration-dependent (Figure 1) beginning at 40 mM (approximately 1%) with irreversible ablation of the compound action potential at 80 mM (approximately 2%). Kanai et al. [4] subsequently demonstrated that generation of action potentials was more vulnerable than maintenance of resting membrane potential and that irreversible ablation of action and resting membrane potential by lidocaine seems to be both concentration- and time-dependent.Figure 1: The nonreversible effect of 40 mM lidocaine on the compound action potential (CAP) of frog sciatic nerve. Lidocaine was applied to a stable nerve preparation for 15 min, then washed with frog Ringer's solution for 2 h. Tracings represent CAPs in response to stimuli (1-Hz stimulus = heavy line, 40-Hz stimulus = thin line). Lidocaine 40 mM completely ablated the CAP when applied to the nerve. The 1-Hz CAP response began to return after 10-15 min of washing and reached a new level in 45 min, where it was stable for the subsequent 2 h of observation. The recovered 1-Hz CAP is only 65% of the original. Reprinted with the publisher's permission from Holman SJ. Anesthesiology: hyperbaric dye solution distribution. Anesthesiology 1997;86:969.Effects of local anesthetics on spinal cord blood flow seem benign. Spinal administration of bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine causes vasodilation and increase spinal cord blood flow [6,7], whereas ropivacaine causes concentration-dependent vasoconstriction and reduction in spinal cord blood flow [6]. However, the effects of lidocaine on blood flow of in vitro peripheral nerve models are more concerning. Myers et al. [8] applied solutions of isotonic sodium chloride solution, 1% and 2% lidocaine with and without epinephrine, and epinephrine alone to isolated rat sciatic nerve and measured changes in blood flow with a laser Doppler flow probe. Blood flow was significantly depressed for all solutions except isotonic sodium chloride solution. Epinephrine by itself significantly reduced nerve blood flow, and, when added to local anesthetic solutions, it reduced blood flow to a greater extent than the reduction caused by local anesthetics alone. Although experimental studies in animals have provided ample evidence that some local anesthetics in clinically relevant concentrations can injure nerve tissue, the exact mechanisms of injury are unclear. Recent work on neuronal cell lines has attempted to determine the mechanism of local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Johnson and Uhl [9] have shown that direct application of 2.5%-5.0% lidocaine caused a >3-fold increase in intracellular calcium and up to a 20% incidence of cell death during 60 min of exposure in the neuronal cell line. They postulated that the mechanism of neurotoxicity was not likely from sodium channel blockade, because such a block would not lead to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium. Subsequent work in this model determined that 0.5% and 1.0% lidocaine, as well as 0.625% bupivacaine, lead to transient, moderate increases in calcium, probably from the endoplasmic reticulum, without cell death [10]. Thus, several different laboratory models have proven that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic but that lidocaine and tetracaine are potentially more neurotoxic than bupivacaine (Table 1).Table 1: Local Anesthetic ToxicityDespite the knowledge that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic in the laboratory model, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics in humans (Table 2). Retrospective [11], prospective [12], and historical studies [13-15] report 0%-0.7% incidence of postoperative neurologic injury in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Although lacking a denominator, information from closed-claims databases corroborate these findings [16,17]. Thus, the neurotoxic potential of spinally administered local anesthetics has not manifested itself in large-scale studies.Table 2: Large Epidemiologic Studies of the Neurologic Complications of Spinal AnesthesiaThere are few nonepidemiologic clinical studies evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of local anesthetics, and all have focused on electrophysiologic variables after spinal anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials, monosynaptic H-reflex [18], and cutaneous current perception thresholds [19] have been used to evaluate recovery after spinal anesthesia. These measurements have shown complete return to baseline activity after 5% lidocaine spinal anesthesia in very small study populations. Histopathologic or other physiologic data in humans are lacking; thus, information from controlled studies in humans is essentially not available. Lidocaine Controversy about the use of single-injection spinal lidocaine began in 1993 when Schneider et al. [20] published four cases of short-lived neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lidocaine. This was the first report to question the potential for neurotoxicity with standard clinical doses and concentrations of lidocaine after single-injection spinal anesthesia. Subsequent prospective, randomized studies reveal a 4%-33% incidence of TNS after lidocaine spinal anesthesia (Table 3) [21,22]. This incidence varies with the type of surgical procedure and is unaffected by baricity or the dilution of lidocaine to 0.5%. Contemporary reports of cauda equina syndrome after continuous lidocaine spinal anesthesia and the potential concentration-dependent neurotoxicity of lidocaine have led several authors to label TNS as a manifestation of subclinical neurotoxicity.Table 3: Incidence of Transient Neurologic Symptoms (TNS) with Spinal Anesthesia in Prospective Randomized StudiesAs previously discussed, laboratory work in both intrathecal and desheathed peripheral nerve models has proven that the concentration of lidocaine is a critical factor in neurotoxicity. Because concentrations of lidocaine <40 mM (approximately 1.0%) are not neurotoxic to desheathed peripheral nerve, such dilute concentrations of spinal lidocaine should not cause TNS if the syndrome is caused by subclinical concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. We recently examined whether spinal lidocaine concentrations of <1.0% might therefore decrease the incidence of TNS [21]. Patients undergoing knee arthroscopy were randomized to receive 50 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine as either a 2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5% solution. There was no difference in the incidence of TNS (18%) among the three groups. The high incidence of TNS with lidocaine concentrations <1%, despite further dilution in cerebrospinal fluid, seem to lessen the plausibility of a concentration-dependent neurotoxic etiology. Other potential etiologies for TNS include patient positioning, early mobilization, needle trauma, neural ischemia, pooling of local anesthetics secondary to maldistribution by pencil-point needles or the addition of glucose, muscle spasm, myofascial trigger points, and irritation of dorsal ganglia [21]. The etiology of TNS is undetermined, and further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In summary, local anesthetics all have the potential to be neurotoxic, particularly in concentrations and doses larger than those used clinically. In histopathologic, electrophysiologic, behavioral, and neuronal cell models, lidocaine and tetracaine seem to have a greater potential for neurotoxicity than bupivacaine at clinically relevant concentrations. Nonetheless, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics. Spinal Analgesics There is a complex system of different receptors for the transmission and inhibition of nociception in the spinal cord. These receptors include [micro sign]1-opioid receptors, alpha2-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, gamma-amino butyric acid agonist (GABA) receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The neuropeptides substance P and somatostatin function as activators and inhibitors of nociception, respectively, and arachidonic acid metabolites enhance pain transmission [23]. Drugs that have been administered spinally in humans are thought to act directly or indirectly within this array of agonists and receptor sites (Figure 2). For each drug, the animal safety data and the human safety data are presented and summarized in Table 4.Figure 2: Schematic of mechanisms and sites of actions of spinal analgesics. mu-1 = opioid receptor, m1 = muscarinic type I acetylcholine receptor, ACh = acetylcholine, alpha2 = adrenergic receptor, NE = norepinephrine, GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABAr = GABA receptor, NMDAr = N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NK-1r = neurokinin 1 receptor, NSAIDS = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, + and unshaded arrows = activation, - and black arrows = inhibition.Table 4: Evidence of Neurotoxicity of Spinal AnalgesicsOpioids Hydrophilic Opioids. Dogs and cats exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal morphine for several weeks through indwelling catheters showed no abnormal histopathology of the spinal cord under light microscopy [24,25]. Spinal cord blood flow is unaffected by 0.2 mg of intrathecal morphine in dogs [26]. Consistent with a lack of histologic or physiologic neurotoxicity, behavioral effects reported in rats receiving 10-100 [micro sign]g/kg intrathecal morphine did not include evidence of neurotoxicity [27]. Limited postmortem neurohistopathology studies in patients with cancer after long-term, continuous intrathecal infusions containing morphine failed to definitively implicate the drug (with metabisulfite preservative) in any histopathologic abnormalities [28,29]. Electrophysiologic study of spinal morphine is limited to examination of somatosensory evoked potentials, which are unchanged despite intense analgesia [30]. No clinical abnormalities attributable to intrathecal morphine were reported in these studies. Spinal meperidine has undergone no published preclinical animal neurotoxicity testing. In humans, spinal meperidine has been reported as an effective sole drug for surgical anesthesia without noted clinical neuropathology, but no formal neurotoxicity testing has been undertaken [31]. Spinal hydromorphone has not been safety tested in animals. A single report describes hydromorphone administered spinally with clonidine in a woman with cancer pain without postmortem evidence of abnormal neurohistopathology [32]. Lipophilic Opioids. In its present preservative-free, commercially available form, fentanyl is commonly administered spinally. However, fentanyl is also notably absent from animal safety testing data. Histopathologic studies of isolated rabbit vagus nerve axons bathed in test solution failed to show evidence of localized neural damage with fentanyl dissolved in isotonic solution. Potential electrophysiologic neurotoxicity was reported with the commercially available hypotonic solution of fentanyl, which caused permanent conduction deficits comparable to water alone [33]. In vivo, only relatively large doses of fentanyl citrate would be expected to create a hypotonic intrathecal environment. Controlled human safety data are also minimal with spinal fentanyl. There are no published reports specifically addressing the histologic, physiologic, or clinical evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal fentanyl. No report of persistent neurologic complications was retrieved from a MEDLINE search, despite widespread clinical use of spinal fentanyl. Sufentanil was administered to cats with indwelling intrathecal catheters for 5 days without distinguishable neurohistopathological abnormalities [27]. Similarly, dogs exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal sufentanil for several weeks also showed no abnormal histopathology [24]. However, sheep exposed to large (approximately 50 [micro sign]g) and very large (approximately 200 [micro sign]g) doses of sufentanil every 6 h for 3 days through intrathecal catheters showed evidence of dose-dependent spinal cord histopathology [34]. These findings may reflect a neurotoxic effect at large doses or quite possibly an artifact of the experimental design due to the frequent, large-volume, hypotonic preparation used in this study. No studies of spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology are available. The rats, cats, and dogs used in the above experiments had no persistent behavioral deficits. The sheep demonstrated dose-dependent agitation and hind-limb motor deficits that resolved spontaneously. There is no formal human neurotoxicity testing of sufentanil, but there are also no clinical reports of neurological impairment from widespread use. The spinal administration of alfentanil to cats for 5 days and to dogs for several weeks through indwelling intrathecal catheters induced no abnormal histopathology [24]. There are no reports of human experience with intrathecal alfentanil. Spinal remifentanil has been studied for efficacy in rats, but no histopathology has been published [35]. Rat behavior changes, other than sedation, were not reported, and recovery was not described. There is no published human experience with spinal remifentanil. Partial Opioid Receptor Agonists. In the sheep experiments with sufentanil noted above, butorphanol given intrathecally as a commercial solution of citrate and tartate salts caused florid histologic and behavioral pathology, whereas nalbuphine in saline was associated with minimal inflammatory histologic changes, mild neuronal changes at large doses, and transient hindlimb weakness [34]. No other animal or human data are available. In summary, laboratory studies and extensive clinical experience with morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil can reasonably assure the safety of limited intrathecal doses of these drugs. Other opioid agonists or partial agonists are without animal and human safety testing data. alpha2 Receptor Agonists Clonidine is the predominant spinal alpha2-agonist. Extensive preclinical tests in animals produced no neurohistopathologic abnormalities in rats, dogs, sheep, or monkeys. Spinal cord blood flow studies in rats, pigs, and awake sheep reveal perturbations that, on the whole, do not suggest significant decreases under normal clinical circumstances. No behavioral abnormalities suggesting neurotoxicity have been associated with intrathecal clonidine [36]. There has been extensive and graded exposure of humans to spinal clonidine (>968 surgical, obstetrical, and chronic pain patients) with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [36]. Although no histopathologic or physiologic studies have been reported, clonidine seems to be a safe spinal drug in humans. Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitors Neostigmine indirectly produces a muscarinic agonist effect by inhibiting acetycholinesterase and has been shown to cause analgesia in animal and human experiments. Neurohistopathological analysis of rats and dogs after long-term intrathecal neostigmine (with and without paraben preservatives) administration reveal no spinal cord toxicity [37,38]. Neostigmine does not affect spinal cord blood flow in sheep [37], and there were no behavioral changes suggesting neurotoxicity reported in the above animal studies. Phase I safety assessments in human volunteers have been performed for both preservative-free (50-750 [micro sign]g) and paraben-containing hyperbaric preparations (10-100 [micro sign]g) of spinal neostigmine without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [40,41]. Although the human experience with spinal neostigmine is limited, clinical trials performed thus far have not reported any evidence of neurologic sequelae. gamma-Amino Butyric Acid Agonists (Table 5) Midazolam. Unlike other benzodiazepines, midazolam is soluble in an aqueous solution when buffered to approximately pH 3.5. At physiologic pH, midazolam becomes lipophilic, facilitating tissue penetration. These characteristics have made midazolam the most extensively studied spinal benzodiazepine. Neurotoxicity studies in animals have yielded conflicting results. Four initial rat studies with intrathecal catheter implantation using 0.15 mg/kg for 15 days (two studies) or isolated exposures to 0.1-0.3 mg/kg of midazolam (two studies) prepared in saline solution showed no neurotoxic reactions on light or electron microscopy [42]. However, a subsequent study in rabbits after a single 0.1 mg/kg intrathecal injection of midazolam reported that three of nine animals (33%) showed spinal cord histopathologic changes 8 days after exposure [43]. The diffuse nature of the histopathologic abnormalities that uncharacteristically extended from cervical to lumbar sections, the presence of significant and persistent diastolic hypotension in the treatment group, and the delayed postmortem tissue fixation all suggest a possible systemic source of artifact in the three affected animals. To investigate these contrasting results, a state-of-the-art study on the rat was performed using light microscopy, electron microscopy, cell morphometry, and transcardial tissue fixation after daily intrathecal administration of approximately 0.3 mg/kg midazolam for 20 days [44]. The spinal cords showed strong evidence of neuronal death and cellular abnormalities, even on light microscopy, in most midazolam-treated rats. Of note, a hypotonic commercial preparation of midazolam was used in contrast to the isotonic saline preparation used in all previous reports. Hypotonicity results in permanent nerve injury in isolated nerve preparations [33] and has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of spinal sufentanil in sheep [45]. Although hypotonicity may be the etiology of the reported abnormalities, intrinsic neurotoxicity of spinal midazolam is a consideration.Table 5: Comparative Animal and Human Toxicity Data of Common Spinal AdjuvantsNo animal studies on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology have been reported. The effect of midazolam on blood-brain barrier integrity was investigated in the above-described study on rabbits and showed compromise in three of nine animals [43]. Despite some histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity, no significant behavioral abnormalities have been reported in any of the animal neurotoxicity studies of intrathecal midazolam. There are no histologic or physiologic studies of humans exposed to spinal midazolam, although there are seven small reports of intrathecal midazolam for anesthesia and pain management. Within this limited human experience, there are no reports of clinical neurologic deficit, even after prolonged continuous intrathecal use in four patients with chronic benign pain syndromes [46]. Midazolam neurotoxicity is controversial. Although the commercial midazolam solution seems to be neurotoxic in rats, hypotonicity of the solution may be culpable, rather than the drug itself. Midazolam in saline does not seems to be neurotoxic in the rat, but it may be toxic in the rabbit. There are insufficient studies in humans to determine the risk of neurotoxicity with spinal midazolam. Baclofen Spinal spasticity, which is thought to result from disinhibition of motor horn cells after upper motor neuron damage, can be treated with baclofen. Baclofen is a stable analog of GABA and interacts primarily with the inhibitory GABA-B receptors in lamina 2 of the dorsal horn (Figure 1). Twenty-eight dogs exposed to chronic spinal delivery of either saline, clinical, or supraclinical doses of baclofen showed no neurohistopathologic changes. Cats exposed to intrathecal baclofen for 8 days likewise showed no abnormal spinal cord histopathology [47]. No studies on spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology have been published with regards to intrathecal baclofen. Neither dogs, cats, nor monkeys showed behavioral evidence of neurotoxicity [25]. There are no published human studies evaluating histopathologic or physiologic neurotoxicity of baclofen. Spinal baclofen was infused in seven subjects for 3-22 mo without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [48]. An extensive review of cases involving intrathecal baclofen overdose did not note any long-term sequelae [49]. Based on animal studies and considerable clinical experience, spinal baclofen is not likely to cause neurologic damage. N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Antagonists Ketamine. Animal studies examining the neurotoxicity of ketamine generally support its safety, with the exception of some poorly explained findings. Studies performed in monkeys, baboons, and rabbits after single-dose intrathecal ketamine injections (0.3-0.6 mg/kg) with and without benzethonium chloride preservative did not uncover histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity [50,51]. In contrast, two other rat studies reported histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal ketamine. One study found vacuolization of the ganglion cells in posterior nerve roots in 3 of 33 rats that died immediately on injection of preservative-free ketamine [52]. However, it is difficult to ascribe these findings to ketamine neurotoxicity given the uncertain circumstances of demise. Similarly, another rat study with single intrathecal injections of 2.5 mg of ketamine hydrochloride with the preservative benzethonium chloride reported that two of six rats had radicular demyelination injury at sites distant from the injections on histological examination [53]. However, more than half of the animals in the ketamine treatment group either died after rapid injection (two rats) or had single hindlimb paralysis after injection (four rats), which puts the validity of the results in question. No animal studies have been published on the effect of spinal ketamine on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology. Rabbits showed a pattern of blood-brain barrier compromise differing significantly from that of saline-injected control rabbits after single 3-mg injections of ketamine with chlorbutanol [43] but not with preservative-free ketamine [50]. The neurotoxicity of spinal ketamine is largely untested in humans, despite a few case series reporting ketamine use for spinal anesthesia and analgesia [54]. Taken together, the rat, rabbit, and primate studies with intrathecal ketamine support its safety if used without a preservative. A small preliminary human experience suggests that the anesthetic is well tolerated. However, the commercially available preparation of ketamine contains an untested preservative (benzethonium chloride) and cannot be recommended for intrathecal use in humans. Amitriptyline. Preclinical animal testing of intrathecal amitriptyline is limited to a physiologic assessment in adult sheep [55]. A range of intrathecal doses (0.25, 1, or 5 mg) with a maximal dose representing approximately 25-50 times the anticipated human dose did not reduce spinal cord blood flow. No behavioral abnormalities were reported except for transient agitation with the injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline. The injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline into the cervical intrathecal space sedated the animals for 10-60 min, whereas 10 mg produced intense sedation and seizure, followed by death from uncertain causes in one animal. Long-term exposure and neurohistopathologic studies are reported to be in progress [55]. The determination of amitriptyline neurotoxicity awaits further investigation. Somatostatin In rats, intrathecal somatostatin (SST) produced marked, dose-dependent neurotoxic responses at or near doses required to produce analgesia [56] with similar findings in cats and mice [57]. SST administered in similar doses to guinea pigs, in contrast, did not provoke significant neurohistopathological changes [58]. Spinal SST in rats had significant vasoconstrictive effects in the spinal cord and brain, leading to reduced blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and compromised blood-brain barrier [59]. No spinal cord blood flow changes were seen in the guinea pig. Significant behavioral changes were noted in the rat, cat, and mouse experiments, but not in the guinea pig experiments. Species differences in the neurotoxic susceptibility to SST may explain these differences, but there is evidence for neurotoxicity in several animal species. In humans, spinal SST has been offered to terminally ill patients. Four patients with intractable cancer pain were studied after daily injections of spinal SST. Postmortem histopathology was undertaken on the spinal cords of two patients. One showed moderate degeneration of some dorsal roots within the cauda equina, whereas the other demonstrated no histopathologic changes. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were not discussed [60]. In summary, SST has been shown to be neurotoxic in rats, mice, and cats at doses comparable to those that confer analgesia. In humans, relatively small doses of SST have been anecdotally reported to variably relieve pain in the absence of overt neurologic sequelae. Based on this demonstrated record of neurotoxicity in several animal species, spinal SST should be considered a last-line analgesic only in the terminally ill patient. Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs Prostaglandins are involved in the spinal cord facilitation of pain processing, and spinal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can abolish wind-up behavior in animals [61]. Although the analgesic efficacy of spinal ketorolac has been established, no animal neurotoxicity studies have been published [61]. However, the 10% alcohol solvent used for commercial preparations is potentially neurotoxic, and commercial ketorolac should not be used spinally. Lysine acetylsalicylic acid (L-ASA) dosed intrathecally has been shown to be antinociceptive and has been tested in the rat for neurotoxicity with conflicting results. Although limited technically by a >50% spinal cord trauma rate related to needle puncture, one rat study reported radicular demyelination injury in one of the seven undamaged rats (14%) who received intrathecal L-ASA [53]. In contrast, neither histopathologic abnormalities nor a persistent decrease in spinal cord blood flow were seen in another rat study with large daily doses of L-ASA for at least 14 days [62]. The initial study described aggressive behavioral changes in rats after the spinal injection of L-ASA, leading to death from combat. The subsequent study did not report behavioral findings.

      "title": "The Neurotoxicity of Drugs Given Intrathecally (Spinal)",
      "abstract": "A growing understanding of the neuropharmacology of spinal cord processing of nociceptive input has led to intense interest in the use of spinal drugs in anesthesia and pain management. The direct application of receptor-specific therapeutics at the spinal cord can potentially interrupt specific pain pathways and limit systemic side effects, but this practice also carries the inherent risk of injury to the central nervous system. Thus, the neurotoxicity of spinal drugs is a central safety issue. Spinal cord or nerve root toxicity may manifest itself as histologic, physiologic, or behavioral/clinical derangements after exposure to a spinal drug. Neurohistopathology is broadly classified as neural injury, gliosis, or damage to the myelin sheath, and it also describes inflammatory changes and involvement of the arachnoid cell layers. Physiologic neurotoxicity of spinal drugs includes changes in spinal cord blood flow, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and changes in the electrophysiology of impulse conduction. Behavioral and clinical signs of neurotoxicity include pain, motor and sensory deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Ideally, a complete roster of histological, physiologic, and behavioral testing would be performed on spinal drugs in several animal species, followed by safety trials in humans before widespread use. In practice, drugs have taken a variety of roads from conception to application, and often without safety data. In this article, we review available neurotoxicity data on drugs that have a clinical application, classified as spinal local anesthetics, spinal analgesics, or spinal adjuvants. Spinal Local Anesthetics The 100-yr history of spinal local anesthetic use in humans has typically involved self-experimentation, followed by widespread application with little or no controlled testing for neurotoxicity. Bier and Hildebrant [1] initially performed spinal anesthesia with cocaine on themselves in 1898, and essentially all of the earliest local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia were introduced in this fashion without toxicity studies. Despite a long history of clinical use, recent interest in neurotoxicity has arisen due to concerns over reports of cauda equina syndrome and transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) from spinal local anesthetics. We review animal data that have been used to assess the neurotoxicity of local anesthetics and summarize data available from human studies. In 1985, Ready et al. [2] evaluated the neurotoxic effects of single injections of local anesthetics in rabbits. They reported that spinal cord histopathology remained normal and that persistent neurologic deficits were not seen with clinically used concentrations of tetracaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, or chlorprocaine. However, histopathologic changes and neurologic deficits did occur with higher concentrations of tetracaine (1%) and lidocaine (8%). In this model, extensive neurologic impairment was not necessarily accompanied by equally extensive lesions in the spinal cord and nerve roots, thus demonstrating the need for multiple models to fully assess neurotoxicity. Recent studies have used desheathed peripheral nerve models, designed to mimic unprotected nerve roots in the cauda equina, to further assess electrophysiologic neurotoxicity of clinically relevant concentrations of local anesthetics [3-5]. These models demonstrate that clinically used concentrations of 5% lidocaine and 0.5% tetracaine cause irreversible conduction block, whereas 1.5% lidocaine, 0.75% bupivacaine, and 0.06% tetracaine do not. Electrophysiologic toxicity of lidocaine in these models is concentration-dependent (Figure 1) beginning at 40 mM (approximately 1%) with irreversible ablation of the compound action potential at 80 mM (approximately 2%). Kanai et al. [4] subsequently demonstrated that generation of action potentials was more vulnerable than maintenance of resting membrane potential and that irreversible ablation of action and resting membrane potential by lidocaine seems to be both concentration- and time-dependent.Figure 1: The nonreversible effect of 40 mM lidocaine on the compound action potential (CAP) of frog sciatic nerve. Lidocaine was applied to a stable nerve preparation for 15 min, then washed with frog Ringer's solution for 2 h. Tracings represent CAPs in response to stimuli (1-Hz stimulus = heavy line, 40-Hz stimulus = thin line). Lidocaine 40 mM completely ablated the CAP when applied to the nerve. The 1-Hz CAP response began to return after 10-15 min of washing and reached a new level in 45 min, where it was stable for the subsequent 2 h of observation. The recovered 1-Hz CAP is only 65% of the original. Reprinted with the publisher's permission from Holman SJ. Anesthesiology: hyperbaric dye solution distribution. Anesthesiology 1997;86:969.Effects of local anesthetics on spinal cord blood flow seem benign. Spinal administration of bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine causes vasodilation and increase spinal cord blood flow [6,7], whereas ropivacaine causes concentration-dependent vasoconstriction and reduction in spinal cord blood flow [6]. However, the effects of lidocaine on blood flow of in vitro peripheral nerve models are more concerning. Myers et al. [8] applied solutions of isotonic sodium chloride solution, 1% and 2% lidocaine with and without epinephrine, and epinephrine alone to isolated rat sciatic nerve and measured changes in blood flow with a laser Doppler flow probe. Blood flow was significantly depressed for all solutions except isotonic sodium chloride solution. Epinephrine by itself significantly reduced nerve blood flow, and, when added to local anesthetic solutions, it reduced blood flow to a greater extent than the reduction caused by local anesthetics alone. Although experimental studies in animals have provided ample evidence that some local anesthetics in clinically relevant concentrations can injure nerve tissue, the exact mechanisms of injury are unclear. Recent work on neuronal cell lines has attempted to determine the mechanism of local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Johnson and Uhl [9] have shown that direct application of 2.5%-5.0% lidocaine caused a >3-fold increase in intracellular calcium and up to a 20% incidence of cell death during 60 min of exposure in the neuronal cell line. They postulated that the mechanism of neurotoxicity was not likely from sodium channel blockade, because such a block would not lead to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium. Subsequent work in this model determined that 0.5% and 1.0% lidocaine, as well as 0.625% bupivacaine, lead to transient, moderate increases in calcium, probably from the endoplasmic reticulum, without cell death [10]. Thus, several different laboratory models have proven that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic but that lidocaine and tetracaine are potentially more neurotoxic than bupivacaine (Table 1).Table 1: Local Anesthetic ToxicityDespite the knowledge that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic in the laboratory model, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics in humans (Table 2). Retrospective [11], prospective [12], and historical studies [13-15] report 0%-0.7% incidence of postoperative neurologic injury in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Although lacking a denominator, information from closed-claims databases corroborate these findings [16,17]. Thus, the neurotoxic potential of spinally administered local anesthetics has not manifested itself in large-scale studies.Table 2: Large Epidemiologic Studies of the Neurologic Complications of Spinal AnesthesiaThere are few nonepidemiologic clinical studies evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of local anesthetics, and all have focused on electrophysiologic variables after spinal anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials, monosynaptic H-reflex [18], and cutaneous current perception thresholds [19] have been used to evaluate recovery after spinal anesthesia. These measurements have shown complete return to baseline activity after 5% lidocaine spinal anesthesia in very small study populations. Histopathologic or other physiologic data in humans are lacking; thus, information from controlled studies in humans is essentially not available. Lidocaine Controversy about the use of single-injection spinal lidocaine began in 1993 when Schneider et al. [20] published four cases of short-lived neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lidocaine. This was the first report to question the potential for neurotoxicity with standard clinical doses and concentrations of lidocaine after single-injection spinal anesthesia. Subsequent prospective, randomized studies reveal a 4%-33% incidence of TNS after lidocaine spinal anesthesia (Table 3) [21,22]. This incidence varies with the type of surgical procedure and is unaffected by baricity or the dilution of lidocaine to 0.5%. Contemporary reports of cauda equina syndrome after continuous lidocaine spinal anesthesia and the potential concentration-dependent neurotoxicity of lidocaine have led several authors to label TNS as a manifestation of subclinical neurotoxicity.Table 3: Incidence of Transient Neurologic Symptoms (TNS) with Spinal Anesthesia in Prospective Randomized StudiesAs previously discussed, laboratory work in both intrathecal and desheathed peripheral nerve models has proven that the concentration of lidocaine is a critical factor in neurotoxicity. Because concentrations of lidocaine <40 mM (approximately 1.0%) are not neurotoxic to desheathed peripheral nerve, such dilute concentrations of spinal lidocaine should not cause TNS if the syndrome is caused by subclinical concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. We recently examined whether spinal lidocaine concentrations of <1.0% might therefore decrease the incidence of TNS [21]. Patients undergoing knee arthroscopy were randomized to receive 50 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine as either a 2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5% solution. There was no difference in the incidence of TNS (18%) among the three groups. The high incidence of TNS with lidocaine concentrations <1%, despite further dilution in cerebrospinal fluid, seem to lessen the plausibility of a concentration-dependent neurotoxic etiology. Other potential etiologies for TNS include patient positioning, early mobilization, needle trauma, neural ischemia, pooling of local anesthetics secondary to maldistribution by pencil-point needles or the addition of glucose, muscle spasm, myofascial trigger points, and irritation of dorsal ganglia [21]. The etiology of TNS is undetermined, and further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In summary, local anesthetics all have the potential to be neurotoxic, particularly in concentrations and doses larger than those used clinically. In histopathologic, electrophysiologic, behavioral, and neuronal cell models, lidocaine and tetracaine seem to have a greater potential for neurotoxicity than bupivacaine at clinically relevant concentrations. Nonetheless, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics. Spinal Analgesics There is a complex system of different receptors for the transmission and inhibition of nociception in the spinal cord. These receptors include [micro sign]1-opioid receptors, alpha2-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, gamma-amino butyric acid agonist (GABA) receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The neuropeptides substance P and somatostatin function as activators and inhibitors of nociception, respectively, and arachidonic acid metabolites enhance pain transmission [23]. Drugs that have been administered spinally in humans are thought to act directly or indirectly within this array of agonists and receptor sites (Figure 2). For each drug, the animal safety data and the human safety data are presented and summarized in Table 4.Figure 2: Schematic of mechanisms and sites of actions of spinal analgesics. mu-1 = opioid receptor, m1 = muscarinic type I acetylcholine receptor, ACh = acetylcholine, alpha2 = adrenergic receptor, NE = norepinephrine, GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABAr = GABA receptor, NMDAr = N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NK-1r = neurokinin 1 receptor, NSAIDS = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, + and unshaded arrows = activation, - and black arrows = inhibition.Table 4: Evidence of Neurotoxicity of Spinal AnalgesicsOpioids Hydrophilic Opioids. Dogs and cats exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal morphine for several weeks through indwelling catheters showed no abnormal histopathology of the spinal cord under light microscopy [24,25]. Spinal cord blood flow is unaffected by 0.2 mg of intrathecal morphine in dogs [26]. Consistent with a lack of histologic or physiologic neurotoxicity, behavioral effects reported in rats receiving 10-100 [micro sign]g/kg intrathecal morphine did not include evidence of neurotoxicity [27]. Limited postmortem neurohistopathology studies in patients with cancer after long-term, continuous intrathecal infusions containing morphine failed to definitively implicate the drug (with metabisulfite preservative) in any histopathologic abnormalities [28,29]. Electrophysiologic study of spinal morphine is limited to examination of somatosensory evoked potentials, which are unchanged despite intense analgesia [30]. No clinical abnormalities attributable to intrathecal morphine were reported in these studies. Spinal meperidine has undergone no published preclinical animal neurotoxicity testing. In humans, spinal meperidine has been reported as an effective sole drug for surgical anesthesia without noted clinical neuropathology, but no formal neurotoxicity testing has been undertaken [31]. Spinal hydromorphone has not been safety tested in animals. A single report describes hydromorphone administered spinally with clonidine in a woman with cancer pain without postmortem evidence of abnormal neurohistopathology [32]. Lipophilic Opioids. In its present preservative-free, commercially available form, fentanyl is commonly administered spinally. However, fentanyl is also notably absent from animal safety testing data. Histopathologic studies of isolated rabbit vagus nerve axons bathed in test solution failed to show evidence of localized neural damage with fentanyl dissolved in isotonic solution. Potential electrophysiologic neurotoxicity was reported with the commercially available hypotonic solution of fentanyl, which caused permanent conduction deficits comparable to water alone [33]. In vivo, only relatively large doses of fentanyl citrate would be expected to create a hypotonic intrathecal environment. Controlled human safety data are also minimal with spinal fentanyl. There are no published reports specifically addressing the histologic, physiologic, or clinical evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal fentanyl. No report of persistent neurologic complications was retrieved from a MEDLINE search, despite widespread clinical use of spinal fentanyl. Sufentanil was administered to cats with indwelling intrathecal catheters for 5 days without distinguishable neurohistopathological abnormalities [27]. Similarly, dogs exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal sufentanil for several weeks also showed no abnormal histopathology [24]. However, sheep exposed to large (approximately 50 [micro sign]g) and very large (approximately 200 [micro sign]g) doses of sufentanil every 6 h for 3 days through intrathecal catheters showed evidence of dose-dependent spinal cord histopathology [34]. These findings may reflect a neurotoxic effect at large doses or quite possibly an artifact of the experimental design due to the frequent, large-volume, hypotonic preparation used in this study. No studies of spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology are available. The rats, cats, and dogs used in the above experiments had no persistent behavioral deficits. The sheep demonstrated dose-dependent agitation and hind-limb motor deficits that resolved spontaneously. There is no formal human neurotoxicity testing of sufentanil, but there are also no clinical reports of neurological impairment from widespread use. The spinal administration of alfentanil to cats for 5 days and to dogs for several weeks through indwelling intrathecal catheters induced no abnormal histopathology [24]. There are no reports of human experience with intrathecal alfentanil. Spinal remifentanil has been studied for efficacy in rats, but no histopathology has been published [35]. Rat behavior changes, other than sedation, were not reported, and recovery was not described. There is no published human experience with spinal remifentanil. Partial Opioid Receptor Agonists. In the sheep experiments with sufentanil noted above, butorphanol given intrathecally as a commercial solution of citrate and tartate salts caused florid histologic and behavioral pathology, whereas nalbuphine in saline was associated with minimal inflammatory histologic changes, mild neuronal changes at large doses, and transient hindlimb weakness [34]. No other animal or human data are available. In summary, laboratory studies and extensive clinical experience with morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil can reasonably assure the safety of limited intrathecal doses of these drugs. Other opioid agonists or partial agonists are without animal and human safety testing data. alpha2 Receptor Agonists Clonidine is the predominant spinal alpha2-agonist. Extensive preclinical tests in animals produced no neurohistopathologic abnormalities in rats, dogs, sheep, or monkeys. Spinal cord blood flow studies in rats, pigs, and awake sheep reveal perturbations that, on the whole, do not suggest significant decreases under normal clinical circumstances. No behavioral abnormalities suggesting neurotoxicity have been associated with intrathecal clonidine [36]. There has been extensive and graded exposure of humans to spinal clonidine (>968 surgical, obstetrical, and chronic pain patients) with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [36]. Although no histopathologic or physiologic studies have been reported, clonidine seems to be a safe spinal drug in humans. Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitors Neostigmine indirectly produces a muscarinic agonist effect by inhibiting acetycholinesterase and has been shown to cause analgesia in animal and human experiments. Neurohistopathological analysis of rats and dogs after long-term intrathecal neostigmine (with and without paraben preservatives) administration reveal no spinal cord toxicity [37,38]. Neostigmine does not affect spinal cord blood flow in sheep [37], and there were no behavioral changes suggesting neurotoxicity reported in the above animal studies. Phase I safety assessments in human volunteers have been performed for both preservative-free (50-750 [micro sign]g) and paraben-containing hyperbaric preparations (10-100 [micro sign]g) of spinal neostigmine without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [40,41]. Although the human experience with spinal neostigmine is limited, clinical trials performed thus far have not reported any evidence of neurologic sequelae. gamma-Amino Butyric Acid Agonists (Table 5) Midazolam. Unlike other benzodiazepines, midazolam is soluble in an aqueous solution when buffered to approximately pH 3.5. At physiologic pH, midazolam becomes lipophilic, facilitating tissue penetration. These characteristics have made midazolam the most extensively studied spinal benzodiazepine. Neurotoxicity studies in animals have yielded conflicting results. Four initial rat studies with intrathecal catheter implantation using 0.15 mg/kg for 15 days (two studies) or isolated exposures to 0.1-0.3 mg/kg of midazolam (two studies) prepared in saline solution showed no neurotoxic reactions on light or electron microscopy [42]. However, a subsequent study in rabbits after a single 0.1 mg/kg intrathecal injection of midazolam reported that three of nine animals (33%) showed spinal cord histopathologic changes 8 days after exposure [43]. The diffuse nature of the histopathologic abnormalities that uncharacteristically extended from cervical to lumbar sections, the presence of significant and persistent diastolic hypotension in the treatment group, and the delayed postmortem tissue fixation all suggest a possible systemic source of artifact in the three affected animals. To investigate these contrasting results, a state-of-the-art study on the rat was performed using light microscopy, electron microscopy, cell morphometry, and transcardial tissue fixation after daily intrathecal administration of approximately 0.3 mg/kg midazolam for 20 days [44]. The spinal cords showed strong evidence of neuronal death and cellular abnormalities, even on light microscopy, in most midazolam-treated rats. Of note, a hypotonic commercial preparation of midazolam was used in contrast to the isotonic saline preparation used in all previous reports. Hypotonicity results in permanent nerve injury in isolated nerve preparations [33] and has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of spinal sufentanil in sheep [45]. Although hypotonicity may be the etiology of the reported abnormalities, intrinsic neurotoxicity of spinal midazolam is a consideration.Table 5: Comparative Animal and Human Toxicity Data of Common Spinal AdjuvantsNo animal studies on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology have been reported. The effect of midazolam on blood-brain barrier integrity was investigated in the above-described study on rabbits and showed compromise in three of nine animals [43]. Despite some histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity, no significant behavioral abnormalities have been reported in any of the animal neurotoxicity studies of intrathecal midazolam. There are no histologic or physiologic studies of humans exposed to spinal midazolam, although there are seven small reports of intrathecal midazolam for anesthesia and pain management. Within this limited human experience, there are no reports of clinical neurologic deficit, even after prolonged continuous intrathecal use in four patients with chronic benign pain syndromes [46]. Midazolam neurotoxicity is controversial. Although the commercial midazolam solution seems to be neurotoxic in rats, hypotonicity of the solution may be culpable, rather than the drug itself. Midazolam in saline does not seems to be neurotoxic in the rat, but it may be toxic in the rabbit. There are insufficient studies in humans to determine the risk of neurotoxicity with spinal midazolam. Baclofen Spinal spasticity, which is thought to result from disinhibition of motor horn cells after upper motor neuron damage, can be treated with baclofen. Baclofen is a stable analog of GABA and interacts primarily with the inhibitory GABA-B receptors in lamina 2 of the dorsal horn (Figure 1). Twenty-eight dogs exposed to chronic spinal delivery of either saline, clinical, or supraclinical doses of baclofen showed no neurohistopathologic changes. Cats exposed to intrathecal baclofen for 8 days likewise showed no abnormal spinal cord histopathology [47]. No studies on spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology have been published with regards to intrathecal baclofen. Neither dogs, cats, nor monkeys showed behavioral evidence of neurotoxicity [25]. There are no published human studies evaluating histopathologic or physiologic neurotoxicity of baclofen. Spinal baclofen was infused in seven subjects for 3-22 mo without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [48]. An extensive review of cases involving intrathecal baclofen overdose did not note any long-term sequelae [49]. Based on animal studies and considerable clinical experience, spinal baclofen is not likely to cause neurologic damage. N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Antagonists Ketamine. Animal studies examining the neurotoxicity of ketamine generally support its safety, with the exception of some poorly explained findings. Studies performed in monkeys, baboons, and rabbits after single-dose intrathecal ketamine injections (0.3-0.6 mg/kg) with and without benzethonium chloride preservative did not uncover histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity [50,51]. In contrast, two other rat studies reported histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal ketamine. One study found vacuolization of the ganglion cells in posterior nerve roots in 3 of 33 rats that died immediately on injection of preservative-free ketamine [52]. However, it is difficult to ascribe these findings to ketamine neurotoxicity given the uncertain circumstances of demise. Similarly, another rat study with single intrathecal injections of 2.5 mg of ketamine hydrochloride with the preservative benzethonium chloride reported that two of six rats had radicular demyelination injury at sites distant from the injections on histological examination [53]. However, more than half of the animals in the ketamine treatment group either died after rapid injection (two rats) or had single hindlimb paralysis after injection (four rats), which puts the validity of the results in question. No animal studies have been published on the effect of spinal ketamine on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology. Rabbits showed a pattern of blood-brain barrier compromise differing significantly from that of saline-injected control rabbits after single 3-mg injections of ketamine with chlorbutanol [43] but not with preservative-free ketamine [50]. The neurotoxicity of spinal ketamine is largely untested in humans, despite a few case series reporting ketamine use for spinal anesthesia and analgesia [54]. Taken together, the rat, rabbit, and primate studies with intrathecal ketamine support its safety if used without a preservative. A small preliminary human experience suggests that the anesthetic is well tolerated. However, the commercially available preparation of ketamine contains an untested preservative (benzethonium chloride) and cannot be recommended for intrathecal use in humans. Amitriptyline. Preclinical animal testing of intrathecal amitriptyline is limited to a physiologic assessment in adult sheep [55]. A range of intrathecal doses (0.25, 1, or 5 mg) with a maximal dose representing approximately 25-50 times the anticipated human dose did not reduce spinal cord blood flow. No behavioral abnormalities were reported except for transient agitation with the injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline. The injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline into the cervical intrathecal space sedated the animals for 10-60 min, whereas 10 mg produced intense sedation and seizure, followed by death from uncertain causes in one animal. Long-term exposure and neurohistopathologic studies are reported to be in progress [55]. The determination of amitriptyline neurotoxicity awaits further investigation. Somatostatin In rats, intrathecal somatostatin (SST) produced marked, dose-dependent neurotoxic responses at or near doses required to produce analgesia [56] with similar findings in cats and mice [57]. SST administered in similar doses to guinea pigs, in contrast, did not provoke significant neurohistopathological changes [58]. Spinal SST in rats had significant vasoconstrictive effects in the spinal cord and brain, leading to reduced blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and compromised blood-brain barrier [59]. No spinal cord blood flow changes were seen in the guinea pig. Significant behavioral changes were noted in the rat, cat, and mouse experiments, but not in the guinea pig experiments. Species differences in the neurotoxic susceptibility to SST may explain these differences, but there is evidence for neurotoxicity in several animal species. In humans, spinal SST has been offered to terminally ill patients. Four patients with intractable cancer pain were studied after daily injections of spinal SST. Postmortem histopathology was undertaken on the spinal cords of two patients. One showed moderate degeneration of some dorsal roots within the cauda equina, whereas the other demonstrated no histopathologic changes. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were not discussed [60]. In summary, SST has been shown to be neurotoxic in rats, mice, and cats at doses comparable to those that confer analgesia. In humans, relatively small doses of SST have been anecdotally reported to variably relieve pain in the absence of overt neurologic sequelae. Based on this demonstrated record of neurotoxicity in several animal species, spinal SST should be considered a last-line analgesic only in the terminally ill patient. Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs Prostaglandins are involved in the spinal cord facilitation of pain processing, and spinal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can abolish wind-up behavior in animals [61]. Although the analgesic efficacy of spinal ketorolac has been established, no animal neurotoxicity studies have been published [61]. However, the 10% alcohol solvent used for commercial preparations is potentially neurotoxic, and commercial ketorolac should not be used spinally. Lysine acetylsalicylic acid (L-ASA) dosed intrathecally has been shown to be antinociceptive and has been tested in the rat for neurotoxicity with conflicting results. Although limited technically by a >50% spinal cord trauma rate related to needle puncture, one rat study reported radicular demyelination injury in one of the seven undamaged rats (14%) who received intrathecal L-ASA [53]. In contrast, neither histopathologic abnormalities nor a persistent decrease in spinal cord blood flow were seen in another rat study with large daily doses of L-ASA for at least 14 days [62]. The initial study described aggressive behavioral changes in rats after the spinal injection of L-ASA, leading to death from combat. The subsequent study did not report behavioral findings.

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

Por otro lado, los trastornos formales del pensamiento inciden directamente en la comunicacion de las personas con esquizofrenia. Se analizo psicopatologia, lenguaje y trastornos formales del pensamiento en 51 pacientes con diagnostico de esquizofrenia y 51 sujetos sanos, tomados como grupo control. Los resultados indican como el lenguaje a nivel de semantica y pragmatica en personas con esquizofrenia, se encuentra alterado, pudiendo hablarse de un lenguaje esquizofrenico, con un amplio nivel de afectacion en el lenguaje. Ademas, la relacion entre psicopatologia-trastornos formales del pensamiento-trastornos del lenguaje-habilidades comunicativas forma parte de un continuo, en el que si una parte se encuentra afectada, altera los valores de los demas.

There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment.

O objetivo deste estudo foi caracterizar os achados neurológicos e vestibulares de três casos clínicos com diagnóstico de EM. Dados sobre a avaliação neurológica e do exame de ressonância magnética de crânio foram coletados dos prontuários. Os pacientes responderam a uma entrevista inicial e foram submetidos à avaliação clínica do equilíbrio corporal e ao Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT). Observou-se presença de sintomas vestibulares e alterações em pelo menos uma das provas clínicas do equilíbrio corporal e função cerebelar. No vHIT, obteve-se alterações em testes oculomotores, como presença de nistagmo semi-espontâneo e em parâmetros do teste sacádico, e ganho reduzido em um ou mais canais verticais. Foram verificadas lesões, na ressonância magnética de crânio, em áreas centrais que processam as informações vestibulares, como cerebelo e tronco encefálico. A associação destes achados sugere a presença de disfunção vestibular central, compatível com as lesões detectadas nos exames de imagem.",

Karya Tulis Ilmiah Studi Kasus, Program Studi DIII Keperawatan, Jurusan Keperawatan, Politeknik Kesehatan Kemenkes Riau. Pembimbing (I) Ns. Nia Khusniyati M, S.Kep, M.Kep (II) Hj. Melly, SST, M.Kes.\r\n\r\nDiabetes Mellitus adalah suatu keadaan dimana tubuh bisa menghasilkan hormon insulin sesuai kebutuhan atau tubuh tidak bisa memanfaatkan secara optimal insulin yang dihasilkan, sehingga terjadi lonjakan kadar gula dalam darah melebihi normal. Pada penderita diabetes mellitus terutama yang sudah bersifat kronik dapat terjadi gangguan atau komplikasi berupa neuropati diabetik, protein uria, kelainan koroner. Pada kerusakan sistem saraf dibagi tiga kelompok yaitu kerusakan sistem saraf perifer, kerusakan saraf otonom, kerusakan saraf motorik. Kerusakan sistem saraf perifer pada umumnya dapat menyebabkan kesemutan, nyeri pada tangan dan kaki, serta berkurangnya sensitifitas atau mati rasa. Sehingga penderita diabetes mellitus lebih tinggi resikonya mengalami masalah kaki yaitu sirkulasi darah kaki ke tungkai yang menurun, berkurangnya perasaan pada kaki, berkurangnya daya tahan tubuh terhadap infeksi. Pada umumnya penderita diabetes mellitus terlambat untuk menyadari bahwa terjadi luka pada kakinya disebabkan gangguan sirkulasi pembuluh darah yang menyebabkan luka tersebut sukar untuk sembuh dan akan menjadi ulkus atau gangren. Tujuan dari penulisan ini adalah mahasiswa mampu memberi asuhan keperawatan secara komprehensif dengan metode kasus yang dilakukan terhadap Ny. J pada tanggal 30 Maret sampai 01 April 2020. Hasil studi kasus ini menyebutkan bahwa Ny. J mengalami diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik dengan empat masalah keperawtan yaitu nyeri, hambatan mobilitas fisik, kerusakan integritas kulit, resiko infeksi. Evaluasi selama menjalani perawatan nyeri yang dirasakan hilang, nyaman dalam beraktifitas, luka pada kaki pada fase maturasi (penyembuhan). Saran untuk perawat di UPT puskesmas sungai pakning terutama perawat di ruangan rawat inap untuk dapat menerapkan asuhan keperawatan klien diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik secara komprehensif yang memperhatikan kesembuhan pasien secara teratur. Saran untuk penulis selanjutnya adalah studi kasus ini dapat dikembangkan lagi untuk penulis selanjutnya pada asuhan keperawatan yang lebih rinci lagi untuk menghasilkan asuhan keperawatan yang lebih berkualitas dan bermanfaat bagi pasien. \r\n\r\nKata kunci : Diabetes Mellitus, Ulkus Diabetik, Nyeri, Hambatan Mobilitas, Kerusakan Integritas Kulit, Resiko Infeksi",

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

The primary paralytic form of obstruction may be caused (1) by violent inhibitory impulses transmitted to the muscle walls of the intestines from the central nervous system by the splanchnic nerves through the sympathetics; (2) by impairment or destruction of the energy in the neurenteric plexus, and the myogenic force in the walls of the intestines on which motility and peristalsis depend, resulting from the poisonous action of bacterial enzymes from the intestines or the peritoneal cavity on the nerves or muscles in the bowel walls, or from traumatism; or (3) by the combined",

      "title": "Somatoform Disorders",
      "abstract": "Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. Some authors prefer other terminology, including use of the terms medically unexplained symptoms, emphasizing the uncertainty about diagnosis, or functional somatic syndromes, suggesting that symptoms are due to disturbances in the function of psychophysiological systems rather than structural or anatomical pathology.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Sensory deprivation speeds up the degenerative changes normally associated with aging and enhances the loss of functional cells in the central nervous system. Since it connotes reduction or absence of stimulation of the five senses, it involves the patient's physical activity, social relationships, intellectual status and overall \"value system.\" Geriatric patients with various illnesses are particularly vulnerable to sensory deprivation, which becomes increasingly pronounced as physical or mental deterioration progresses. All cells require stimulation for continued growth and activity; lack of stimulation leads to atrophy, with secondary physical or psychosocial abnormalities. Depression acts as a negative reinforcement of stimuli, and anxiety acts as a blocking mechanism. The goal of rehabilitation is to maintain and strengthen the patient's social values and to preserve mental and physical motility. The recommended procedure involves assessment of medical, psychologic and social factors, and determination of whether organic disease is present. A specific treatment plan to meet the individualized needs of each patient is then established so as to minimize sensory deprivation and maximize physical and mental functioning. Re-evaluation (physical and psychologic) at regular intervals establishes a pattern not only for individual comparison but for comparison with results in untreated control groups.",

      "title": "2394 – Burnout is a myth",
      "abstract": "The term „burnout” does not denote a psychiatric category, but a psychological label for the experience of a long-lasting exhaustion and loss of interest. Burnout is not an explicitly recognized disorder in prominent classifications of diseases. It is rather a state of emotional exhaustion and reduced sense of personal accomplishment than a syndrome or a disease. It can be assessed, e.g., by The Maslach Burnout Inventory which uses a three dimensional description of exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. Some authors argue for an “exhaustion only” model that sees exhaustion as the hallmark of „burnout“. Engagement, which is characterized by energy and efficacy, may be regarded as the opposite to burnout, which is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy. On the other hand, this condition is described in the ICD-10 as “Problems related to lifemanagement difficulty” (Z73, i.e., not among mental disorders but among Factors influencing health status and contact with health services, Z00-99). As this condition is also described in DSM-IV as “adjustment disorder”, the concept of „burnout” seems to be redundant and useful only out of medicine as a journalistic label for a reaction which can be classified otherwise.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

A number of abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia have been linked to the field of psychoneuroimmunology. Schizophrenia occurs due to various factors (multifactorial), including genetic factors, environment and neurological abnormalities. Psychologically, schizophrenia occurs due to a mismatch between affection, cognition and behavior. Neurologically, in schizophrenia there is overactivity of the dopaminergic system, in the main dopamine pathway, namely in the mesolimbic, mesocortex, nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular, as well as increased serotonergic activity. Meanwhile, immunologically, schizophrenia occurs due to changes in microglia activity which affects the immune response and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The clinical manifestations of schizophrenia consist of 3 categories of symptoms, in the form of positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms/interpersonal relationship disorders. Management of schizophrenia is carried out comprehensively with pharmacological antipsychotic treatment and psychosocial therapy which aims to improve quality of life and reduce morbidity and mortality of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Les signes neurologiques mineurs (SNM) sont des marqueurs aujourd’hui bien reconnus dans la schizophrénie, présents à un moindre degré chez les apparentés. Leur signification et leur spécificité reste néanmoins incertaines. Des aspects méthodologiques pourraient expliquer certaines de ces incertitudes (échelles variables selon les publications, méthodes de cotation sensible ou non au changement, types de signes pris en comptes etc) [1]. Les corrélats des SNM peuvent apporter des éléments de réponses sur leur origine et leur signification. Nous avons ainsi montré que la SNM sont associés à une moindre performance cognitive, à plus d’erreurs dans les tâches oculomotrices, notamment dans des tâches de saccades adaptatives [2], ainsi à une altération du circuit préfronto cérébelleux [3], suggérant un dysfonctionnement cérébelleux. Par ailleurs, nous avons également montré que les patients ayant des SNM ont une altération de la morphologie corticale, avec une moindre gyrification corticale, témoignant de l’origine développementale des SNM [4]. Enfin, nous avons montré récemment que les SNM sont plus marqués chez les sujets présentant un début des troubles précoces, avant l’adolescence (avant 15 ans), comparés à ceux présentant un trouble débutant à l’âge adulte, suggérant à nouveau que les SNM sont les marqueurs d’une forme à charge développementale plus importante. L’association des SNM avec un âge de début précoce et des anomalies structurales touchant en particulier les circuits cérébelleux, suggère que les SNM pourraient permettre d’identifier un sous-type de schizophrénie précoce, et interroge sur un continuum avec les troubles du spectre autistique.",

      "title": "Funcionamiento neurocognitivo y psicosocial de pacientes con trastorno bipolar en una unidad de salud mental",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION: Existe evidencia de que los pacientes que padecen TB, e incluso sus familiares sanos, presentan patrones caracteristicos de afectacion de ciertos dominios neurocognitivos que persisten tras la remision clinica o periodo de eutimia. La perdida de funcionalidad psicosocial de estos pacientes se predice mejor con la presencia de alteraciones cognitivas que con variables clinicas o evolutivas. El clinico asistencial deberia conocer si existe afectacion o deterioro las funciones neurocognitivas de sus pacientes pero el medio asistencial cotidiano es dificil poder evaluar adecuadamente las funciones cognitivas y tampoco se acostumbra a cuantificar la funcionalidad psicosocial de los pacientes con TB. Las dificultades principales son la falta de entrenamiento de los profesionales y el elevado consumo de tiempo de las baterias neuropsicologicas. Por ello la mayoria de publicaciones a nivel mundial sobre este tema se han realizado centros asistenciales de tercer nivel o unidades superespecializadas, las cuales suelen estudiar pacientes con una mayor gravedad clinica. Es posible que, al menos parte de los conocimientos actuales sobre cognicion y funcionalidad del TB, no sean representativos o extrapolables al universo (o conjunto) de personas con esta enfermedad. Pretendemos esta investigacion estudiar una poblacion en el real, no afectada por sesgos que pueden derivarse de las muestras de las unidades superespecializadas o de los restrictivos ensayos clinicos. METODOLOGIA: El estudio pretende reclutar a todas las personas que padecen TB seguimiento psiquiatrico una Unidad de Salud Mental (USM) para evaluar el estado neurocognitivo y el funcionamiento psicosocial y cuantificar el consumo de recursos sanitarios durante el ano previo a la evaluacion. Las escalas elegidas por su brevedad y facil aplicabilidad para evaluar dichos funcionamientos son respectivamente el Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S) y la Escala Breve del Funcionamiento o Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST), sus versiones espanolas. El objetivo principal del estudio es caracterizar el funcionamiento neurocognitivo y psicosocial de la muestra y objetivos secundarios son el analisis de la relacion entre distintas variables clinicas, evolutivas, diagnosticas y de tratamiento con el funcionamiento cognitivo y psicosocial asi como su relacion con el consumo de recursos sanitarios y establecer que parte de la varianza del funcionamiento psicosocial se explica por el grado de afectacion cognitiva de los pacientes con TB. JUSTIFICACION DEL ESTUDIO: Ademas del interes que supone este estudio por realizarse una muestra que pretende representar el mundo real al cenirse a explorar a los pacientes que acuden al primer punto basico de atencion psiquiatrica un Departamento de Salud como son las USM, se anade la innovacion de correlacionar el estado cognitivo y funcional con el uso de recursos sanitarios, aspecto aun no reflejado la literatura. RESULTADOS: El estudio corrobora hallazgos previos la relacion de ciertas variables clinicas con la afectacion cognitiva y funcional, sobre todo con la presencia de sintomas subsindromicos depresivos. Difiere la severidad de la afectacion cognitiva y funcional. No hay relacion del consumo de recursos sanitarios el ano previo con la afectacion cognitiva pero si la hay con la funcional. El modelo de regresion lineal y logistica para predecir la varianza de la afectacion funcional confirma la hipotesis inicial de que la afectacion cognitiva la predice junto con otras variables clinicas y terapeuticas. DISCUSION Y CONCLUSIONES: Nuestra muestra presenta diferencias sus caracteristicas demograficas y clinicas respecto de otras muestras estudiadas y esto parece relacionado con los resultados de afectacion cognitiva, funcional y de consumo de recursos sanitarios. Se discuten las implicaciones de estos resultados y la importancia de aplicar una evaluacion neurocognitiva y funcional la practica clinica habitual de una USM.",

Since afferent sensations of pain travel through fibers that may be of symppathetic origin and these fibers run parallel with the postganglionic fibers to blood vessels and visceral organs, pain also is considered a symptom resulting from dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system. The surgical treatment consists of sympathetic ganglionectomy and trunk resection, with section of rami and postganglionic fibers,<sup>1</sup>in order to interrupt completely sympathetic pathways carrying efferent and afferent stimuli to a given area or organ.

      "abstract": "Functional testing is useful to monitor the natural history of several neuromuscular disorders, and to measure the efficacy of therapeutic agents in clinical trials. A major limitation of functional testing is that a single test is often not appropriate throughout all stages of disease. The same limitation holds true for other measurements of disease progression. MMT and quantitative myometry become technically difficult to perform and lack sensitivity to disease progression at some stages in the course of DMD, ALS, and spinal muscular atrophy. Other limitations of functional testing are its lack of sensitivity to detect a subtle improvement or decline in muscle strength, and the difficulty of applying standard statistical methods to analyze disease progression or therapeutic efficacy. The advantages of functional testing outweigh the limitations. Function testing uses daily activities to monitor disease progression. Patient's appreciate improvements in function more readily than improvements in muscle strength. Functional testing is easily standardized and is reliable. It can be performed, with little or no expense, in almost any clinical setting. The primary challenge for investigators who wish to incorporate functional tests is to identify functional tests that best measure the natural history of the specific disease under investigation. Further, functional testing allows the clinician to provide an educated guess on the likely future course of disease.",

In a consideration of this influence, it is desirable that we remember the prime subdivisions indicated by the will, intellect and emotions.

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

      "abstract": "Zhang et al 1 recently reported that visual function loss but not visual acuity was associated with depression.In an accompanying editorial, Morse 2 further described how the loss of functional vision (ie, actual task-related visual performance) leads to depression.The article and editorial raise important questions about the terminology of vision and function.To explore understanding of these terms, we informally discussed the abstract with 20 ophthalmologist colleagues.Based solely on the abstract, 6 participants (30%) believed that the study focused on conversion symptoms (ie, a somatoform disorder).According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), \"The common feature of somatoform disorders is the presence of physical symptoms that suggest a general medical condition… and are not fully explained by a general medical condition, by the direct effects of a substance, or by another mental disorder.\" 3Psychiatrists have replaced the term functional with the more specific DSM-IV-TR classification.Ophthalmologists appear to lack a clear sense of the term functional when describing vision and function.How should loss of visual function (ie, physical decline in the ocular system), self-reported loss of function due to poor vision, and functional vision loss (ie, perceived vision loss in the absence of organic pathology) be described?The disablement literature provides a unique framework for separating organic and somatoform loss of vision, and their functional sequelae.Verbrugge and Jette posited in 1994 the \"disablement process,\" a sociomedical model of disability that describes \"how chronic and acute conditions affect functioning\" 4 and how \"personal and environmental factors speed or slow disablement.\" 4In this model, pathology leads to impairment (dysfunctions and structural abnormalities in specific body systems), which leads to functional limitations (restrictions in basic physical and mental actions) and then disability (difficulty performing activities of daily life).Ophthalmologists might best adhere to this model when describing eye disease and its consequences, invoking vision loss, visual impairment, loss of visual function, and visual disability.This schema will improve communication between clinicians and in the medical literature and provide a clearer conception of the impact of vision loss on function.As to our patients who report high levels of disability due to vision loss, perhaps beyond what we might expect based on what we see in their eyes, we should abandon any deprecatory terms, recognize their distress, and direct treatment to the whole person.",

      "abstract": "The spinal cord is a complex organization of nerve cells responsible for movement and sensation. It carries signals between the brain and the rest of the body. Spinal cord injuries can range from sensory loss to incomplete or complete paralysis. Spinal cord diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions that cause damage or dysfunction of the spinal cord. They include infections, inflammatory disorders, vascular diseases and disorders that affect the meninges or perimeningeal spaces that surround the spinal cord. Motor, sensory, reflex, and sphincter abnormalities may be used to determine the location of a lesion within one of four major longitudinal divisions of the spinal cord. The divisions are cervical (C1–C5 spinal cord segments), cervical enlargement (C6–T2), thoracolumbar (T3–L3), and lumbar enlargement (L4–Cd5). A disorder of each of the four regions of the spinal cord results in a combination of neurological signs that is specific for the region involved. Recognition of a characteristic group of clinical signs therefore allows accurate localization of a spinal cord lesion. Spinal Cord disorders are conditions that cause damage and deterioration to the spinal cord. These conditions include Spinal stenosis, Herniated Discs, Degenerative disc disease etc. Symptoms of Spinal Cord Disorders are weakness or paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, uncontrolled muscle spasms and back pain etc. Having knowledge of the location and structure of the protective spinal cord can help healthcare professionals to provide pain relief for certain procedures.",

Every strongly relevant individual concern, like fears, can yield cognitive bias or \"cognitive-emotional sensitization\". It might also be present for bodily and environmental information related to illness, and could be an etiological factor in medically unexplained complaints. Physiological and cognitive sensitization are theoretically compared. There is evidence for cognitive-emotional sensitization in some medically unexplained somatic complaints, and negative affect is suggested as a catalyst. Prolonged cognitive-emotional sensitization (\"perseverative negative cognition\" or worry, rumination) might even have demonstrable somatic pathological effects. It is concluded that sensitization may be organized at different levels, both in the organism and in the larger living system within which the organism is subsumed. This view might not only help to clarify medically unexplained pain syndromes, but virtually every subjective complaint, both with and without recognized physiopathology.",

Le concept de remission fonctionnelle a pris de l'importance dans notre societe ces dernieres annees. L'aptitude a la reprise de travail en fait partie. De nombreux facteurs peuvent influencer la remission fonctionnelle d'un episode depressif majeur en remission clinique partielle comme les symptomes cliniques residuels de la depression (symptomatologie anxieuse, troubles du sommeil...), les comorbidites (psychiatriques / somatiques eventuelles), la prise d'un traitement antidepresseur, les evenements professionnels, les troubles cognitifs residuels de la depression (deficit des fonctions executives, deficits attentionnels, ralentissement psychomoteur). Ce travail a explore l'Influence de la Cognition Sociale et plus specifiquement de la Theorie de l'Esprit sur la remission fonctionnelle de la depression et l'aptitude professionnelle, au travers d'une etude comparative de 30 patients en remission partielle d'un episode depressif majeur, repartis en deux groupes en fonction de leur statut professionnel.

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "abstract": "The American Psychiatric Association defines mental illnesses as alterations in the cognitive, emotional or behavioral sphere (or a combination of these domains), which lead to suffering and/or problems in the person's social, professional or relational interaction skills. Given the range of possible symptoms, when talking about mental illnesses, reference should always be made to a standardized classification system, i.e. a list of disorders recognized to date, accompanied by their description and lists of symptoms and essential criteria for diagnosis. Currently, the most widely used manual in the world is the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), published by the American Psychiatric Association, whose structure follows a multiaxial system. Other international norms or classification systems include the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), which is often referred to by the WHO in mental health action plans, defining \"mental disorders\" as the range of disorders that falls under the ICD-10 classification. Within the given classifications, we can find disorders of different severities, with significant differences both in terms of the degree of suffering and in terms of the effects on the person's capacity for social interaction. However, the present paper does not aim to analyze clinical problems related to mental illnesses, but to address the state of care of people suffering from such illnesses in our country. In particular, we are motivated by the need to examine, from a bioethical point of view, critical issues arising from various studies of the current state of psychiatric care, critical issues affecting the lives of people with mental illness and their families, and which are strongly denounced to the institutions by the scientific societies.",

In this paper, I describe common psychiatric conditions that often feature pain as part of the illness: somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, factitious physical disorders, pain associated with psychological factors (new DSM-IV nomenclature), and malingering. These conditions can be distinguished based on the conscious awareness (or lack of awareness) of both motivation and symptom production. Other psychiatric disorders may strongly influence chronic pain without directly causing it-depression, anxiety, panic, and post-traumatic stress disorders. Except for malingering and factitious pain, chronic pain should be regarded as genuine.

On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

      "title": "[Possible mechanisms of chronic fatigue syndrome in multiple sclerosis].",
      "abstract": "One of frequent presentations of multiple sclerosis (MS) is chronic fatigue that may be determined as a subjective decrease of the physic and/or psychic energy level. Fatigue can be divided into asthenia (fatigue in resting state), pathological fatigability (exhaustion during physical loading) and fatigue concomitant with other symptoms (MS exacerbation). There are central as well as peripheral mechanisms of fatigue formation. Frequent is a combination of fatigue and affective disorders in MS, in particular depression, as well as sleep disturbances (insomnia, restless legs syndrome) that may indicate the common origin of their mechanisms, i.e. reduction of serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems activity. Endocrinal and autoimmune components are considered as important in fatigue syndrome formation, the latter exerting more influence on asthenia than on pathological fatigability. Further investigation into pathogenetic mechanisms of asthenia (fatigue in resting state), pathological fatigability (fatigue in active state) and specification of their differential diagnostic features allow not only to understand the essence of this syndrome but to choose an adequate individualized therapy.",

      "abstract": "The results of clinical research indicates that multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease of the central nervous system. As a disease which directly affects brain cells, it may cause severe psychological and physiological dysfunctions in some of its victims. The principal psychological effects consist of cognitive and affective disturbances. Among cognitive deficites are memory loss and severe difficulty in conceptual reasoning. These deficits are likely to deprive the person affected by the disease of the ability to understand, reason, and elicit deliberate choice. Severe emotional disturbance indicative of a substantial change in personality. Such a change in personality may incapacitate multiple sclerosis victims in several aspects of their intrapsychic and interpersonal life. In marital relationship, a person may be rendered incapable of fulfilling the essential obligations of marriage. The physiological effects which have important juridic consequences are in the area of sexual dysfunctions. If these effects are present at the time of exchanging consent, a marriage court may have to look for possible functional impotence. If the dysfunction becomes evident after the marriage, the only approach seems to be to investigate the possibility of incapacity to assume the perpetuity of the right to sexual intercourse. If this approach is adopted, the basis for this incapacity is to be found in c. 1095, 3°, which requires that the cause of incapacity to assume the essential obligations of marriage be „psychic” in nature. The fact that someone has been diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis does not constitute definitive basis for the juridic conclusion that such a person is inept for or incapable of contracting marriage. The disease affects each person differently and, hence, interpatient variability with regard to physiological effects is inevitable. Therefore, all patients cannot be regarded as lacking in discretion of judgement and/or in their capacity to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Each case is unique and, therefore, each case must be investigated under an appropriate caput or capita nullitatis according to its particular circumstances.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder broadly characterized by insidious changes in psychosocial domains including personality/mood, behavior, and cognition. Early detection of bvFTD can be challenging in the absence of structural brain changes, cognitive deficits, and/or patient report. Collateral reports and behavioral observations become integral to diagnostic conceptualization.The patient is a 71-year-old White male who was seen by a neurologist for semi-involuntary fidgeting. His spouse also began noticing medication mismanagement and personality changes characterized by irritability, compulsive spending, and irrational thoughts, as well as uncharacteristic lapses in judgement and difficulty with planning and organization. Additional family reports endorsed new perseverative behaviors and intermittent confusion while operating familiar devices. An MRI of the brain demonstrated mild white matter disease.The patient demonstrated superior premorbid intellectual functioning and average-to-above average scores across most neuropsychological tests. Subtle deficits in maintaining set on executive tasks were noted. Behaviorally, speech was perseverative and tangential throughout the evaluation and he demonstrated low frustration tolerance. Collateral questionnaires indicated a decline in most activities of daily living and significant elevations in apathy, personal neglect, and loss of insight.While there were subtle changes in cognition, the patient's overall cognitive profile was intact. However, collateral reports, reported functional decline, and direct behavioral observations warranted concern for early stage bvFTD. Consistent with bvFTD literature, current neuropsychological assessments lack sensitivity for capturing deficits in the presence of behavioral and functional impairment. This case highlights the continued need to develop and validate naturalistic assessments to appropriately capture bvFTD.",

This paper applies the neurosensitization model to the three syndromes which are frequently comorbid and treatment-refractory in clinical practice: (1) chronic pain; (2) depression; and (3) posttraumatic stress disorder.

Dentre outras funcoes, e responsavel em manter a continencia urinaria. A perda das funcoes dessas estruturas, seja por lesao nervosa direta ou por distensao/laceracao muscular, pode reduzir a capacidade do assoalho pelvico e enfraquecer o mecanismo de continencia permitindo a perda urinaria, assim, interferindo negativamente na qualidade de vida causando limitacoes fisicas, sociais, ocupacionais e ou sexuais. A Esclerose Multipla (EM) e a Mielopatia Associada ao HTLV-1 (HAM/TSP) sao desordens neurologicas cronicas, caracterizadas por ataque auto-imune a bainha de mielina causando desmielinizacao do nervo afetado, no qual geralmente resulta na diminuicao da conducao pelo nervo. Um metodo de avaliacao que vem sendo recentemente utilizado para avaliar a funcao dos musculos do assoalho pelvico e a eletromiografia (EMG) com uso de sensor vaginal. Alem de avaliar a capacidade de contracao muscular, a EMG registra a amplitude de contracao em microvolts (µV), sendo que os valores registrados em repouso caracterizam o tonus basal da musculatura. Durante a contracao muscular, a EMG oferece informacoes sobre as fibras fasicas que produzem contracoes de maxima amplitude e maior tempo de duracao. O estudo teve como objetivo avaliar a atividade mioeletrica da musculatura do assoalho pelvico de mulheres portadoras de EM, mielopatia associada ao HTLV-1 e mulheres saudaveis. Foi utilizado um eletromiografo Miotool 400, para a captacao da atividade mioeletrica. Participaram do estudo 15 mulheres, sendo 5 pacientes em cada grupo. Os resultados demonstraram que as mulheres infectadas com o virus HTLV-1 possuem um maior tonus basal da musculatura do assoalho pelvico, em comparacao com as pacientes portadoras da EM. Em relacao a forca de contracao total, as mulheres com o virus HTLV-1 tiveram uma melhor captacao do sinal eletrico dos MAP comparando-se com as doadoras saudaveis e as portadoras de EM. Em geral, as portadoras de EM apresentaram uma menor chegada do sinal eletrico em todos os quesitos avaliados, tanto no tonus basal como nas contracoes voluntarias. Acredita-se que devido o acometimento neurologico das pacientes com EM ser maior do que o das pacientes com HTLV-1 que se apresentaram assintomaticas, a conducao do sinal eletrico ate a musculatura do assoalho pelvico e em menor quantidade.",

Though the most prominent symptom of FM is pain in defined points of the musculoskeletal system, the numerous other somatoform and psychological disorders suppose a common primary disturbance which we consider to originate within higher levels of the central nervous system. Recent studies of the entire endocrine profile of FM patients following a simultaneous challenge of the hypophysis with corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotropin‐releasing hormone, growth hormone‐releasing hormone, and luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone support the hypothesis that an elevated activity of CRH neurons determines not only many symptoms of FM but may also cause the deviations observed in the other hormonal axes. Hypothalamic CRH neurons thus may play a key role not only in “resetting” the various endocrine loops but possibly also nociceptive and psychological mechanisms as well.",

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte.

An important aspect of pain is nociception, a complex series of electrochemical events that involves activation of specialized neural pathways in response to (potentially) tissue-damaging stimuli. Clinically, the degree of nociception is manifested as signs of tissue damage. Pain, in contrast to nociception, is a subjective experience that may involve stimulus-induced activation of afferent neural pathways or other components, such as somatosensory processing or psychosocial factors. Reflex responses to nociceptive stimulation can be described as suprasegmental or cortical and spinal or segmental. Spinal reflexes are generated by nociceptive signals being transmitted through the dorsal horn to somatomotor or autonomic neurons at various spinal levels, resulting in responses such as paralytic ileus, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, or muscle spasm. Suprasegmental reflexes are propagated via the ascending pathways to the brain stem, hypothalamus, and cortex, where withdrawal reflexes and autonomic responses are generated.",

Apesar de raras estas podem apresentar-se como défices dos pares cranianos, sendo importante ter um elevado índice de suspeição e estar familiarizado com o seu diagnóstico e abordagem terapêutica. Os sintomas são por vezes muito inespecíficos, contudo os mais frequentes são as cefaleias, alterações da acuidade visual e diplopia no contexto de disfunção de um ou mais nervos oculares motores. Reporta-se o caso de um indivíduo do sexo masculino, 59 anos de idade, que foi referenciado ao Serviço de Urgência Otorrinolaringologia por quadro de cefaleias frontotemporais de carácter progressivo com uma semana de evolução e agravamento clínico nas últimas 12 horas associando-se diplopia. O exame neurológico sumário não releva outras alterações para além da parésia do nervo motor ocular comum esquerdo. Na rinoscopia anterior/posterior não se verificava presença de massas ou rinorreia mucopurulenta. A Tomografia Computadorizada revelava preenchimento por componente tecidual de partes moles dos seios esfenoidais e erosão do teto do seio esfenoidal esquerdo.

      "title": "Current understanding of nociplastic pain",
      "abstract": "Nociplastic pain by the \"International Association for the Study of Pain\" is defined as pain that arises from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of nociceptive or neuropathic pain. Augmented central nervous system pain and sensory processing with altered pain modulation are suggested to be the mechanism of nociplastic pain. Clinical criteria for possible nociplastic pain affecting somatic structures include chronic regional pain and evoked pain hypersensitivity including allodynia with after-sensation. In addition to possible nociplastic pain, clinical criteria for probable nociplastic pain are pain hypersensitivity in the region of pain to non-noxious stimuli and presence of comorbidity such as generalized symptoms with sleep disturbance, fatigue, or cognitive problems with hypersensitivity of special senses. Criteria for definitive nociplastic pain is not determined yet. Eight specific disorders related to central sensitization are suggested to be restless leg syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorder, migraine or tension headache, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivities, and whiplash injury; non-specific emotional disorders related to central sensitization include anxiety or panic attack and depression. These central sensitization pain syndromes are overlapped to previous functional pain syndromes which are unlike organic pain syndromes and have emotional components. Therefore, nociplastic pain can be understood as chronic altered nociception related to central sensitization including both sensory components with nociceptive and/or neuropathic pain and emotional components. Nociplastic pain may be developed to explain unexplained chronic pain beyond tissue damage or pathology regardless of its origin from nociceptive, neuropathic, emotional, or mixed pain components.",

Die Sturzfolgen können so schwerwiegend sein, dass Betroffene versterben oder eine schwere Behinderung mit Pflegebedürftigkeit davontragen. Unter den zahlreichen Risikofaktoren für Stürze im Alter scheinen sensomotorische Störungen mit verminderten Muskelfunktionen, beeinträchtigter posturaler Balance und Veränderungen der Gehfunktionen im Alter besonders bedeutend zu sein. Sarkopenie beschreibt die altersassoziierten morphologischen und funktionellen Änderungen im Muskel. Mit zunehmendem Alter nehmen die posturalen Balancefunktionen ab, und die automatischen posturalen Reaktionsmuster infolge einer Störung des Haltungsgleichgewichts werden komplexer. Das Gangbild beim alten Menschen verliert an Dynamik; Schrittzeit und Schrittweite variieren stärker als bei jungen Leuten. Die Objektivierung der Muskelfunktionen, Gleichgewichtsfunktionen und Gehfunktionen ist im Rahmen der Abklärung des Sturzrisikos beim alten Menschen sinnvoll, da diagnostizierte Störungen mit physikalischen Therapien im Rahmen der Rehabilitation und Prävention erfolgreich behandelt werden können.",

Als gesichert gilt, dass es sich sowohl um eine neuroinflammatorische als auch neurodegenerative Erkrankung des zentralen Nervensystems handelt, bei der es zu multiplen, zeitlich und örtlich disseminierten Demyelinisierungen unterschiedlichster Lokalisation kommt. Diese bedingen auf klinischer Ebene, neben vielfältigen physischen Symptomen, kognitive Teilleistungsstörungen und psychosoziale Beeinträchtigungen wie eine Depression und Zustände abnormer Ermüdbarkeit (Fatigue). Da der Krankheitsausbruch für die meisten Patienten in eine Lebensphase der beruflichen und sozialen Etablierung und Neuorientierung fällt, stellen v.a. die neurokognitiven Probleme und die Fatigue für einen Großteil der Betroffenen unüberwindbare Hürden dar. Es ist daher von besonderer Relevanz, diese Symptome bereits frühzeitig im Krankheitsgeschehen zu erfassen. Um eine zuverlässige kosten- und zeitökonomische Diagnostik in der klinischen Routine sicherzustellen, wurden subjektive und objektive Screeningverfahren entwickelt, über deren Einsatz bei Multipler Sklerose im Folgenden berichtet wird.",

They can be determined by the action of various influences and their interactions on functional development of the brain. There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders. The article provides review on most significant neurobehavioral manifestations of developmental impairment of the brain during prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal period. The most known adverse factors causing developmental neurobehavioral dysfunctions in humans as well as in experimental animals are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of animal well-being is a complex matter. It is difficult to establish a causal link between stimuli and internal state because of numerous variables and the time interval between cause and effect. Many studies document a correlation rather than a causal relationship among stimuli, responses, and subsequent health, disease, or mental state. Research objectives are often vague, the choice of assessment parameters is perplexing, and the results are difficult to interpret. In general, animal well-being cannot be assessed directly. There are no standardized methods or specific endpoints that provide an objective determination. Overt changes in physical and psychological functions occur only after the animal has experienced a prepathologic state. An animal's response to general arousal, life's events, and aversive stimuli depends on an integrated activation of various neural and endocrine factors. A variety of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics change when an animal is exposed to aversive situations and stimuli, although many also change with the onset of positive general arousal, such as play, pleasant experiences, and sexual excitement. There is a need to evaluate numerous criteria (e.g., performance, clinical state, neurochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, morphology, behavior, and ethology) to compile a complete mental and biological profile of animals. The various systems, processes, and individual specific responses are interrelated and interact in a well-structured manner. Given the complexity of the topic and the disparate disciplines involved, developing a comprehensive understanding of animal well-being is not straightforward. Consequently, observers should be cautious. Foremost in any determination of animal well-being is assurance that criteria being used are relevant to well-being.",

      "abstract": "Functional neurological symptoms refer to neurological symptoms that are not explained by disease. They may also be called psychogenic, non-organic, somatoform, dissociative or conversion symptoms. The most common functional neurological symptoms are non-epileptic attacks and functional weakness. These are common in neurology and general medical practice, especially in emergency situations, where they can be mistaken for epilepsy or stroke. Many studies have shown that these symptoms often persist, are associated with distress and disability and, in the right hands, have a low rate of misdiagnosis. Physicians are often uncertain how to approach patients with these problems. Are patients making up the symptoms? How can the diagnosis be made confidently? What is the best way to explain the diagnosis to the patient? Does treatment ever help? This review takes readers through these questions with practical tips for avoiding common pitfalls, both in diagnosis and management. There is no good evidence that these symptoms are any more 'made up' than irritable bowel symptoms or chronic pain. The diagnosis should usually be made by a neurologist on the basis of positive signs of inconsistency such as Hoover's sign or the typical features of a non-epileptic attack. A 'functional' model of the symptoms is useful both in thinking about the problem and when explaining the symptoms to the patient. There are many useful steps in management that do not require a detailed understanding of aetiology in an individual patient.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

But, in the specific field of psychosis, there \nis an additional contradiction that a fundamental impossiblility in thinking leds the \nsubject to a paradoxical excess of mentalization and keeps him in anxious and attentive overtones concerning his psychic life, which is very different from what escapes \nfrom this mentalization for a logic of another order in the psychosomatic process.",

      "abstract": "Neurosurgical operations treat involuntary movement disorders (MvDs), spasticity, cranial neuralgias, cancer pain, and other selected disorders, and implantable neurostimulation or drug delivery devices relieve MvDs, epilepsy, cancer pain, and spasticity. In contrast, studies of surgery or device implantations to treat chronic noncancer pain or mental conditions have not shown consistent evidence of efficacy and safety in formal, randomized, controlled trials. The success of particular operations in a finite set of disorders remains at odds with disconfirming results in others. Despite expectations that surgery or device implants would benefit particular patients, the normalization of unproven procedures could jeopardize the perceived legitimacy of functional neurosurgery in general. An unacknowledged challenge in functional neurosurgery is the limitation of biological determinism, wherein network activity is presumed to exclusively or predominantly mediate nociception, affect, and behavior. That notion regards certain pain states and mental conditions as disorders or dysregulation of networks, which, by implication, make them amenable to surgery. Moreover, implantable devices can now detect and analyze neural activity for observation outside the body, described as the extrinsic or micro perspective. This fosters a belief that automated analyses of physiological and imaging data can unburden the treatment of selected mental conditions and pain states from psychological subjectivity and complexity and the inherent sematic ambiguity of self-reporting. That idea is appealing; however, it discounts all other influences. Attempts to sway public opinion and regulators to approve deep brain stimulation for unproven indications could, if successful, harm the public interest, making demands for regulatory approval beside the point.",

      "abstract": "Patients with suspected medically unexplained symptoms or psychogenic disorders are frequently requested to undergo an EMG exam. However, the suspected diagnosis is not always told to the electromyography practitioner, who must be able to recognize such a condition to avoid false positive diagnosis without dismissing the possibility to uncover any true dysfunction. There are many clinical manoeuvers to assess the consistency of the patients' reported weakness or sensory deficit. The electrodiagnostic practitioner should be aware of those clinical tricks and interpret the electrodiagnostic findings in the clinical context. There are many electrodiagnostic tests that the practitioner can use for the assessment of motor and sensory functions but these tests have also important drawbacks and limitations. Only after a good clinical evaluation would the practitioner be able to give his/her opinion on the clinical relevance of the electrodiagnostic findings. Here we review some of the tests that can help the practitioner to define the electrophysiological characteristics of a suspected functional disorder presenting with weakness or sensory deficit.",

      "title": "A window into the mind-brain-body interplay: Development of diagnostic, prognostic biomarkers, and rehabilitation strategies in functional motor disorders",
      "abstract": "Background and aims Functional motor disorders (FMD) present a prevalent, yet misunderstood spectrum of neurological conditions characterized by abnormal movements (i.e., functional limb weakness, tremor, dystonia, gait impairments), leading to substantial disability and diminished quality of life. Despite their high prevalence, FMD often face delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, resulting in significant social and economic burdens. The old concept of psychological factors as the primary cause (conversion disorder) has been abandoned due to the need for more evidence about their causal role. According to a predictive coding account, the emerging idea is that symptoms and disability may depend on dysfunctions of a specific neural system integrating interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Consequently, symptoms are construed as perceptions of the body’s state. Besides the main pathophysiological features (abnormal attentional focus, beliefs/expectations, and sense of agency), the lived experience of symptoms and their resulting disability may depend on an altered integration at the neural level of interoception, exteroception, and motor control. Methods and materials Our proposal aims to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of FMD through a three-stage research approach. Initially, a large cohort study will collect behavioral, neurophysiological, and MRI biomarkers from patients with FMD and healthy controls, employing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Subsequently, validation will occur using patients with organic motor disorders. Finally, the algorithm’s prognostic value will be explored post-rehabilitation in one subgroup of patients with FMD. Results Data collection for the present study started in May 2023, and by May 2025, data collection will conclude. Discussion Our approach seeks to enhance early diagnosis and prognostication, improve FMD management, and reduce associated disability and socio-economic costs by identifying disease-specific biomarkers. Trial registration This trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT06328790 ).",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a severe and a complicated mental disorder that affects the overall well-being of an individual through alterations in thought and perceptions wherein the person losses touch with reality. The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

Diese können auch ohne den Nachweis einer substanziellen Hirnschädigung in der neuropsychologisch zu erwartenden Region auftreten. Als Ursache für diese Diskrepanz gelten neuroinflammatorische Prozesse und oxidativer Stress. Am häufigsten sind das verbale Gedächtnis, visuell-räumliche Fähigkeiten, das Gedächtnis für visuelle Inhalte, Aufmerksamkeit, Arbeitsgedächtnis, Exekutivfunktionen (Planung, Kontrolle, Problemlösung, Aufmerksamkeit, Entscheidungsfindung), die allgemeine kognitive Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit und die sprachliche Domäne betroffen. Es zeigt sich, dass das Vorhandensein kognitiver Beeinträchtigungen einen wesentlichen Risikofaktor darstellt, nicht mehr beruflich reintegriert werden zu können. Zusätzlich zu den kognitiven Symptomen treten nach einer aSAB auch gehäuft psychiatrische Symptome wie Angst, Depression und Fatigue auf. Diese wirken sich zusätzlich zu den körperlichen und kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen negativ auf die Teilhabe am beruflichen und sozialen Leben aus, was wiederum zu einer schlechteren Lebensqualität beiträgt.",

Coma is potentially reversible and life threatening and should be treated as a medical emergency. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is often used to describe a person's level of consciousness after injury or medical event. Brain death is the determination of death by neurological criteria. Components of the brain death determination process include a clinical exam documenting the complete absence of all brain stem reflexes and an apea test documenting absent respirations in the setting of hypercarbia. The emotional and psychosocial impact of death is always stressful for those who survive the patient; this can be even more difficult in the setting of brain death.",

The most frequently reported pattern is the one in which patients have a selective or disproportionate impairment in processing the concepts of living things, but the reverse pattern, with the nonliving concepts being more impaired, has also been reported. The existence of such patterns of dissociation suggests that the conceptual system is organized on a categorical basis. However, according to the most widely accepted account for category-specific semantic deficits, these patterns in fact emerge as an accidental consequence of another organizing principle of semantic knowledge, namely, the kind of properties (sensorial or functional) being represented. This sensori-functional account of category-specific semantic deficits presented itself as superior to a categorical account on the basis of the following points: (1) the patterns of dissociation between impaired versus spared categories do not follow the living versus nonliving distinction; (2) these patterns can be accounted for by reference to the kind of properties (visual versus functional) that are relevant for a given class of concepts; (3) the patients with a selective deficit for living things also present with a selective deficit in processing the visual properties of concepts. Here we show that none of these points stand up to analysis of the empirical facts, which in addition are more consistent with the hypothesis of a categorical organization of the conceptual system.",

      "abstract": "NIOSH, 1997) in the USA defines Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) as a disorder that affects a part of the body's musculoskeletal system, which includes bones, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, blood vessels and spinal discs.These are the injuries that result from repeated motions, vibrations and forces placed on human bodies while performing various job actions.The individual factors that can contribute to musculoskeletal symptoms include heredity, physical condition, previous injury, pregnancy, poor diet, and lifestyle.Work-related musculoskeletal disorders occur when there is a mismatch between the physical requirements of the job and the physical capacity of the human body (Korhan, 2010).Musculoskeletal disorders are work-related when the work activities and work conditions significantly contribute to their occurrence, but not necessarily the sole or significant determinant of causation.Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) describe a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative conditions affecting the muscles, tendons, ligaments, joint, peripheral nerves, and supporting blood vessels.These conditions result in pain and functional impairment and may affect especially the shoulder (Westgaard, 2000).The causes of musculoskeletal disorders in the workplace are diverse and poorly understood.The meaning that working has to an individual may help to explain why certain psychological factors are associated with musculoskeletal discomfort and may eventually provide one way to intervene to reduce WRMSD (Mekhora et al., 2000) .Musculoskeletal disorders have been observed and experienced widely at workplaces where the computers are frequently used.Increase in the number of employees working with computer and mouse coincides with an increase of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) and sick leave, which affects the physical health of workers and pose financial burdens on the companies, governmental and non-governmental organizations (Korhan and Mackieh, 2010).WRMSDs cover a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the locomotor system, such as inflammations of tendons, pain and functional impairments of muscles, compression of nerves, and degenerative disorders occurring especially in the shoulder www.intechopen.comErgonomics -A Systems Approach 32 region due to occupations with large static work demands [European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), 2008].The multifactorial causation of WRMSDs is commonly acknowledged.Different groups of risk factors including physical and mechanical factors, organizational and psychosocial factors, and individual and personal factors may contribute to the genesis of WRMSDs (EU- OSHA, 2008).Repetitive handling at high frequency, awkward and static postures, demanding and straining work and lack of recreation times, high time pressure, frequently overtime hours, repetitive or monotonous work, reduced physical capacity, obesity, and smoking are all the risk factors that contribute to WRMSDs either each one solely or by interacting each other.WRMSDs largely affect the back (45%), and upper limb (37%); it is less common to suffer lower limb disorder (18%) (Health and Safety Executive, 2005).Work situations across all industries are implicated, particularly those involving use of the upper limbs, including computer work (Oakley, 2008).

The major sleep disorders discussed in this chapter are insomnia (characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality), hypersomnia or hypersomnolence (characterized by excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy (caused by loss of orexin neurones in the central nervous system (CNS), mutations in orexin receptors or deficits in the synthesis of orexin and characterized by an urge to sleep) and cataplexy (typified by bilateral weakness of the skeletal muscles). Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep. Parasomnias are disorders about sleep–wake transitions and are characterized by strange or abnormal behaviours, incidents or experiences that occur during sleep.",

      "title": "The subjective experience of negative symptoms: Characteristics of emotional withdrawal",
      "abstract": "According to the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), negative symptoms are those personal characteristics that are thought to be reduced from normal functioning, while positive symptoms are aspects of functioning that exist as an excess or distortion of normal functioning. Negative symptoms are generally considered to be a core feature of people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not always present in those diagnosed, and a diagnosis can be made with only negative or only positive symptoms, or with a combination of both. Negative symptoms include an observed loss of emotional expression (affective flattening), loss of motivation or self directedness (avolition), loss of speech (alogia), and also a loss of interests and pleasures (anhedonia). Positive symptoms include the perception of things that others do not perceive (hallucinations), and extraordinary explanations for ordinary events (delusions) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Both negative and positive symptoms are derived from watching the patient and thus do not consider the patient’s subjective experience. However, aspects of negative symptoms, such as observed affective flattening are highly contended. Within conventional psychiatry, the absence of emotional expression is assumed to coincide with an absence of emotional experience. Contrasting research findings suggests that patients who were observed to score low on displayed emotional expression, scored high on self ratings of emotional experience. Patients were also observed to be significantly lower on emotional expression when compared with others (Aghevli, Blanchard, & Horan, 2003; Selton, van der Bosch, & Sijben, 1998). It appears that there is little correlation between emotional experience and emotional expression in patients, and that observer ratings cannot help us to understand the subjective experience of the negative symptoms. This chapter will focus on research into the subjective experiences of negative symptoms. A framework for these experiences will be used from the qualitative research findings of the primary author (Le Lievre, 2010). In this study, the primary author found that subjective experiences of the negative symptoms belonged to one of the two phases of the illness experience; “transitioning into emotional shutdown” or “recovering from emotional shutdown”. This chapter will use the six themes from the phase of “transitioning into emotional shutdown”. This phase described the experience of turning the focus of attention away from the world and onto the self and the past, thus losing contact with the world and others (emotional shutdown). Transitioning into emotional shutdown involved; “not being acknowledged”, “relational confusion”, “not being expressive”, “reliving the past”, “detachment”, and “no sense of direction” (Le Lievre, 2010). Detail will be added to this framework of experience from other qualitative research in this area. We will now review the six themes that constitute a “transition into emotional shutdown” and corresponding previous research findings.",

It is an attempt that often proves difficulty by lack of access to specific investigations and the lack of neuroophthalmology specialists. In most cases, the sudden decrease of vision occurs in the stroke of the eye by occlusion of central retinal artery or one of its branch, occlusion of vein, occlusion of optic nerve vessels or by demyelinating processes of the optic nerve. Rapid diagnosis of eye disease by appropriate clinical or paraclinical investigations, leads to prompt treatment with decreased risk of complications, but in many cases it requires preventive measures.",

      "title": "Pain and Its Modulation",
      "abstract": "Sensory perceptions are inherently subjective, being influenced by factors such as expectation, attention, affect, and past experiences. Nowhere is this more commonly experienced than with the perception of pain, whose perceived intensity and emotional impact can fluctuate rapidly. The perception of pain in response to the same nociceptive signal can also vary substantially between individuals. Pain is not only a sensory experience. It also involves profound affective and cognitive dimensions, reflecting the activation of and interactions among multiple brain regions. The modulation of pain perception by such interactions has been most extensively characterized in the context of the “descending pain modulatory system.” This system includes a variety of pathways that directly or indirectly modulate the activity of neurons in the spinal dorsal horn, the second-order neurons that receive inputs directly from nociceptors. Less understood are the interactions among brain regions that modulate the affective and cognitive aspects of pain perception. Emerging data suggest that certain pain conditions result from dysfunction in pain modulation, suggesting that targeting these dysfunctions might have therapeutic value. Some therapies that are thought to target pain modulation pathways—such as cognitive behavior therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and placebo analgesia—are safer and less expensive than pharmacologic or surgical approaches, further emphasizing the importance of understanding these modulatory mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms through which pain modulation functions may also illuminate fundamental mechanisms of perception and consciousness.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "abstract": "In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), hidden symptoms such as cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction significantly affect quality of life and contribute to disability progression. Despite high prevalence, these symptoms often remain underestimated and underdiagnosed in clinical practice. The pathogenesis of hidden manifestations in MS is multifactorial, involving inflammatory, neurodegenerative, vascular, metabolic, and psychosocial mechanisms. Cognitive impairment in patients with MS most commonly includes decreased information processing, memory deficits, and executive dysfunction. Depression and anxiety frequently co-occur; depressive symptoms are associated with hippocampal changes and cortico-limbic network alterations, while anxiety is linked to dysregulation of limbic structures and neuroinflammatory processes. Fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms in MS, with its pathoge­nesis involving grey matter atrophy, and thalamic lesions. Sexual dysfunction affects more than half of patients and may arise from neurological (primary), somatic (secondary), or psychosocial (tertiary) factors. This review aims to summarize current data on hidden manifestations of MS, their pathogenic mechanisms and clinical significance, as well as to highlight new diagnostic trends. The literature search was performed using Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases with the keywords “multiple sclerosis”, “cognitive impairment”, “depression”, “anxiety”, “fatigue”, and “sexual dysfunction.” Additional references were identified through manual bibliography screening.",

Despite the fact that perinatal grief presents a set of distinctive characteristics, it is not recognized as a differentiated entity in the main diagnostic manuals (DSM-5 and ICD-11). There are a number of characteristics that make perinatal grief a different grief reaction. Characteristics that make perinatal grief a different grief reaction: General characteristics: Proximity between the beginning and the end of life, the lack of religious rituals that legitimize the loss. Physiopathological characteristics; The gestational hormone increase act in the brain favoring emotional bonding with the child and facilitating care, sustained modifications in the gabaergic, endorphinic and nitrinergic synapses in the mothers’ brains. Increased physical activity of the fetus during the third trimester increases the mother’s basal metabolism and changes her emotional reaction. Clinical characteristics; feelings of guilt, loneliness and detachment, irritability, dissociative symptoms, concern dead son and angry reactions. Objectives Search for the specific characteristics of perinatal grief and the importance of its therapeutic approach. Methods Literature review using pubmed database and scientific dissemination articles. Results Between 10 and 50% of mothers who suffer perinatal grief develop depression disorder, 50% have anxiety disorders that usually reappear with the possibility of a new pregnancy, and between 5 and 25% are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Conclusions Perinatal grief has characteristics that differentiate it from other grief reactions; mental health professionals must attend to and understand these specificities in order to attend it.",

This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included \"Parkinson's disease\", \"diagnosis\" and \"signs and symptoms\".Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.",

      "abstract": "La relacion de la ansiedad y depresion entre si y con otros trastornos psiquiatricos supone una gran controversia, precedida por los problemas clasicos en determinar la dependencia o independencia de la sintomatologia y la direccion de la causalidad.  En el campo de las adicciones, este problema se agrava por la implicacion de sustancias externas, hecho que no se da en el juego patologico, siendo las conclusiones derivadas de las investigaciones sobre este trastorno mas viables a la hora de conocer la etiologia adictiva. En el presente articulo se revisan algunos estudios que han examinado el papel de la ansiedad y/o depresion en la adquisicion y mantenimiento del juego patologico, con el objetivo de aclarar las distintas posturas, extrapolando las conclusiones a otras adicciones.  La revision sugiere la unificacion de criterios teoricos y empiricos para poder establecer la implicacion y direccionalidad de determinados factores psicologicos relacionados con el juego patologico.",

Brain death differs from the vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS). The VS is characterized by the complete absence of behavioral evidence of self or of environmental awareness; however, the capacity for spontaneous or stimulus-induced arousal is preserved, as evidenced by the presence of sleep-wake cycles. The MCS is characterized by inconsistent but clearly discernible behavioral evidence of consciousness and can be distinguished from coma and the VS by documented evidence of specific behavioral features not found in either of these conditions. Electrophysiological evaluations, including the assessment of the auditory brainstem response, somatosensory evoked potential, pain-related P250 components, and continuous electroencephalography frequency analysis expressed as a compressed spectral array, are useful for the differential assessment of resting brain function in patients in a VS or MCS.",

To elucidate the pathogenesis of functional somatic syndromes, it is important to focus on gender-related factors, comorbidities of depression and anxiety, physiological responses like autonomic nervous function and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and patient-doctor relationship. Based on recent literatures, mood state and somatosensory amplification are suggested to play an important role in the psychopathological mechanism of functional somatic syndromes, and genetic and environmental factors need to be considered as well.",

Results: Suicidality manifests itself as a disorder in its own right without any one-to-one relationships with other psychiatric or somatic disorders or illnesses. Conclusion: Suicidality has specific features such as susceptibility to interindividual contagion. By preventing suicide we may be able to forestall the development of other types of ill-health and thus improve the quality of the life that has been saved.",

Along with this, a number of diagnoses characterized by an unfavorable prognosis for life can cause significant changes in the patient's mental health, so informing the patient can become a difficult task. A qualitative analysis of doctor-patient communication about life-threatening diseases was carried out and the main psychological problems that arise during such communication were determined. The main negative expectations of doctors in the situation delivering bad news are: intense negative emotions in patient; the possibility development of mental disorders in the patient; projecting negative emotions on the doctor who reported the news; complication of further communication with the patient in connection with the growth of mental distress; discomfort when answering \"uncomfortable questions\"; responsibility imbalance. Improving the professional communication of doctors can be provided by increasing knowledge in clinical psychology, communication skills. But also important is psychological state and dynamics of the doctor's own experiences during reporting a diagnosis, self-observation, reflection and psychological self-help skills, are also an important component.

Grief tasks involve a series of stage or phases following an important loss that gradually permit adjustment and recovery. Three phases of grief involve phase 1 (walking the edges), phase 2 (entering the depths), and phase 3 (reconnecting the world). For intervention to be effective they need to be individually tailored to abnormal grief reaction or unresolved grief reaction.

L’origine d’une collusion se situe dans des problèmes psychologiques non résolus, en lien avec des thématiques comme la perte, l’intimité ou le contrôle, qui sont partagés par le clinicien et son patient.

      "title": "PTSD, DEMENTIA, AND SLEEP DISORDER: A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: A recent article in this journal described three World War II veterans with cognitive impairment who presented with symptoms suggestive of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 The nature and type of dementia in these patients was not specified. Fluctuating cognition is one of the three major diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Fluctuations are described as marked variation in a patient's cognitive or functional abilities or periods of confusion or decreased responsiveness alternating with reasonable lucidity. While identification of fluctuations is difficult, two of the reported patients had episodes of confusion and withdrawal suggestive of fluctuations. Other core features of DLB include recurrent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism.2 The presence of any one criterion is required for a diagnosis of possible DLB, and two or more criteria are required to make a diagnosis of probable DLB. The clinical histories do not mention the presence of visual hallucinations or neuroleptic sensitivity, and the neurological examination was not reported in sufficient detail to ascertain whether these patients might have had features of parkinsonism. All three patients were diagnosed with depression before the onset of their symptoms. All also suffered from paranoid delusions. Delusions and other behavioral disturbances, while seen in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are not common presenting symptoms. Delusions are one of the supportive features of DLB. We have recently reported the validity of the proposed clinical criteria for DLB in our clinical-pathological series.3 We found that whereas delusions had high specificity (91%) in cases with mild to moderate dementia, it had low sensitivity in the diagnosis of DLB (38%). A combination of any three major or minor clinical criteria had the best predictive value (75%) in mild to moderate disease. A subjective disturbance of sleep, including the occurrence of repetitive, stereotypical anxiety dreams, is characteristic of PTSD.4-6 The phenomenology of the PTSD anxiety dream has seemed most consistent with an underlying rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysfunction.4, 5 Whereas near total paralysis is characteristic of the REM phase of sleep, motor activity is common in the sleep disorder seen in PTSD.6 REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a recently described parasomnia characterized by excessive and elaborate motor activities during sleep and is associated with pathological absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep. The relationship between sleep disturbances in PTSD and RBD needs further research. However, the identification of RBD-like signs in PTSD, in previous cases as well as in this series, adds to the evidence for a fundamental disturbance of REM sleep mechanisms in PTSD.4-6 Other reports have described patients with RBD presenting with or subsequently developing cognitive impairment.7, 8 Most of these patients also meet criteria for possible or probable DLB. The pattern of cognitive differences from AD in these patients with RBD and dementia is similar to reported comparisons between DLB and AD. A recent international workshop on criteria for DLB has recommended including depression and RBD as additional supportive features for the diagnosis of DLB.9 The clinical features in these patients suggest a diagnosis of possible or probable DLB. The clinical descriptions do not have features typical of other common types of dementia, such as AD or vascular dementia. It is possible that in some patients PSTD and/or RBD may either herald or present with cognitive impairment, which may subsequently evolve into DLB. Further studies with longitudinal assessments will be required to address this issue. Additional investigations utilizing as polysomnography, sleep questionnaires, and detailed neuropsychological assessments may also help in this regard. The finding of a specific disturbance of sleep unique to PTSD has significant therapeutic implications and also contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the dementia associated with the cases reported.

We present 5 cases: all female, 11–14 years, presenting with vague symptomatology and normal investigations. 3/5 had identifiable psychological stressors. They had a combined total of 15 presentations, 9 admission episodes, 40 in-patient bed days and 20 radiological investigations. 1/5 was diagnosed with a treatable neurological condition. Case 1: EO, 11 years old, repeated presentations with generalised weakness, dizziness, headache and arthralgia. Patient's father had died tragically one year prior. Mother has fibromyalgia and functional neurological disorder. Case 2: RM, 14 years old, multiple episodes of collapse, with apparent unconsciousness (up to 40 minutes) with repeated presentations to hospital. Postulated aetiologies included neurocardiac syncope and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. There followed exclusion from school and multiple medical opinions. Case 3: KO, 14 years old, presented following recurrent pre-syncope, collapse, and shaking episodes. Previously investigated for recurrent vomiting, with no aetiology found. Psychological stressors included disabled sibling, significant mental health disorders, both parents. Case 4: AO, 14 years old, recurring presentations to the emergency department with stuporous state, collapse, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea. Perceived pressure to achieve academic excellence seems the psychological stressor. There followed exclusion from school for some months, on health and safety grounds. Case 5: CM, 13 years old, presented with general malaise, arthralgia, headache and dizziness, with ataxic gait. Difficult transition to secondary school, and involvement in road collision 6 months previous noted. Repeated presentations with worsening symptoms. Objective difficulty eliciting lower limb deep tendon reflexes. Diagnostic lumbar puncture, 3<sup>rd</sup> admission, demonstrated elevated CSF protein. Subsequent development of symmetrical lower limb paraesthesia. Confirmed diagnosis, Guillain Barre syndrome, responsive to immunoglobulin therapy. Conversion disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion and careful systematic approach should be applied, ensuring all organic causes of symptoms have being explored, before attributing symptoms to a psychogenic disorder. <sup>2,3</sup> <h3>References</h3> WHO. <i>The ICD-10 classification of mental behaviour disorders</i> 1992.

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

The study of disease is called pathology. Disease can be described as a medical condition associated with particular symptoms and signs. It can be caused by external factors like pathogens, or caused by internal malfunctions mainly the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity such as allergies and autoimmunity. Diseases are broadly classified to any abnormal condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, or death to the person affected with similar problems. It includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviours, and atypical variations of structure and its function and for others these may be considered as distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically and mentally, as living with a disease will alter the affected person's thinking ability. Death caused by disease are often natural. Diseases are categorised into four main types: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, genetic diseases and physiological diseases. Diseases can be classified as contagious and non-contagious.

Some outstanding questions remain and there are no clear answers so far regarding the differentiation of \"normality\" and pathology related to the SAD, like: (1) is a strong relationship between family members the consequence of specific cultural and social patterns or a pathological pattern that indicates SAD?, or (2) are the pain and suffering resulting from separation from loved ones after wars, natural or other disasters \"normal\"/common/expected or are they psychopathological manifestations of SAD?, etc. In order to clearly identify SAD as an unambiguous psychopathological category, it is necessary to answer these questions in detail.",

      "title": "Compulsive targeted self-injurious behaviour in humans with neuropathic pain: a counterpart of animal autotomy? Four case reports and literature review",
      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

In an era of increasing incidence and survival of patients with single or multiple organ failure, knowledge on both multiorgan crosstalk and the physiopathological consequences of extracorporeal organ support have become increasingly important. Immerse within the cross-talk of multiple organ failure (MOF), Acute kidney injury (AKI) may be a part of the clinical presentation in patients undergoing ECOS, either as a concurrent clinical issue since the very start of ECOS or as a de novo event at any point in the clinical course. At any point during the clinical course of a patient with single or multiple organ failure undergoing ECOS, renal function may improve or deteriorate, as a result of the interaction of multiple factors, including multiorgan crosstalk and physiological consequences of ECOS. Common physiopathological ways in which ECOS may influence renal function includes: 1) multiorgan crosstalk (preexisting or de-novo 2)Hemodynamic changes and 3) ECOS-associated coagulation abnormalities and 3) Also, cytokine profile switch, neurohumoral changes and toxins clearance may contribute to the expected physiological changes related to ECOS. The main objective of this review is to summarize the described mechanisms influencing the renal function during the course of ECOS, including renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/carbon dioxide removal and albumin dialysis.",

Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

These features may herald the onset of the dementia and also are seen in all stages of dementia. Different dementing processes have different neuropsychiatric symptom profiles, which can aid in the differential diagnosis and have therapeutic implications. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may have an adverse impact on the quality of life and well-being of patients as well as their caregivers. Impairment of insight and judgment can lead to financial, medical, and testamentary decision-making impairments. Early recognition of neuropsychiatric changes is a crucial step toward instituting timely social and medical interventions.",

In other words, they generally do not derive from the symptoms of the disorder, nor are they a result of medication nor are they induced by institutionalization. On the contrary, many (though not all) of the neurocognitive deficits seem to reflect predisposition to the illness as opposed to the presence of illness. Hence, the neurocognitive deficits of schizophrenia can be considered central to the disorder.",

Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The nervous, endocrine, and immune systems maintain permanent and concerted communication through humoral and neural pathways, which involves neurotransmitters like serotonin and noradrenaline; hormones like cortisol, corticosterone release hormone; and a wide range of inflammatory molecules and their corresponding receptors. Variations in the circulatory levels of these soluble mediators modulate several physiological processes and help to mantain homeostasis in the face of stressful stimuli, regardless whether they are physical like systemic bacterial, viral or parasitical infections, as well as tissular injuries or psychological stress, that is secondary to the individual’s perception and processing. Chronic activation of neuro-immune-endocrine interactions induces numerical and functional changes in these systems and behavioral disorders. “Sickness behavior” is one the most studied behavioral disorders that is characterized by the presence of anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, decreased appetite, altered sleep patterns, and pain-increased sensitivity. Based on the similarities between the behavioral symptoms of “sickness behavior” and major depression, it has been hypothesized that molecules like cytokines and other inflammatory factors could be involved in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety and personality disorders as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer. The behavioral disorders in major depression can be induced by single or combined administration of proinflammatory cytokines as well as mitogens or infectious agents that induce significant secretion of wide range of inflammatory molecules. Variations in peripheral and central inflammatory mediators significantly affect the levels of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin; p38 MAPK and IDO proteins. The latest data on the involvement of cytokines and neurotransmitters in metabolic pathways have provided various targets for pharmaceutical development and have established new treatment approaches for psychiatric disorders. All this advantages about molecular mecanism involved in behavioural changes will result in the short term in a better quality of life for patients.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of peripartum depression are the same as those of major depressive disorder, and include depressed mood, insomnia, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, guilt, worthlessness, fatigue, impaired concentration, change in appetite, and change in motor activity. Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "abstract": "Somatoform dissociation is a specific form of dissociation with somatic manifestations represented in the form of 'pseudoneurological' symptoms due to disturbances or alterations of normal integrated functions of consciousness, memory or identity mainly related to trauma and other psychological stressors. With respect to the distinction between psychological and somatoform manifestations of dissociation current data suggest a hypothesis to which extent mild manifestations of 'pseudoneurological' symptoms in healthy young population may be linked to stress-related psychopathological symptoms or whether these symptoms more likely could be attributed to unexplained somatic factors. With this aim we have assessed the relationship between somatoform dissociation and stress-related psychopathology (i.e. anxiety, depression, symptoms of traumatic stress, alexithymia) in a group of 250 healthy non-psychiatric and non-clinical young adults. Results of this study show that the symptoms of somatoform dissociation are significantly linked to stress-related psychopathology. Findings of this study show that the 'pseudoneurological' symptoms may be linked to stress-related psychopathological processes which indicate that also mild levels of stress may influence somatic feelings and may lead to various somatoform dissociative symptoms.",

Klinisch beginnt die Symptomatik mit vermehrten Aufwachvorgängen, die zunehmend in eine Fragmentation des Nachtschlafes münden können. Der Zerfall der zirkadianen Rhythmik und die zunehmenden kognitiven Defizite im Rahmen der Demenz stehen in Beziehung zu funktionellen und neuroanatomischen Veränderungen, die die Therapie komplizieren. Benzodiazepine können teilweise hilfreich sein, aber auch paradoxe Reaktionen hervorrufen. Neuroleptika sind in vielen Fällen unverzichtbar, weisen aber ein erhöhtes Risiko für zerebrovaskuläre Ereignisse auf. In diesem Zusammenhang sind nicht pharmakologische Optionen wie der Einsatz von Lichttherapie und körperlicher Aktivität zur Stabilisation des Schlaf-/Wachrhythmus von Interesse. Auch Cholinesterasehemmer und Melatonin können zu einer Stabilisierung des Schlaf-/Wachrhythmus beitragen.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Specific learning disorders (SLD) involve persistent difficulties in reading, writing, and/or mathematics, with a neurobiological basis and not attributable to intellectual, sensory deficits, or inadequate instruction. Their prevalence in school populations ranges from 5–15%, with significant impact on academic performance, self-esteem, and social participation. Objective: To synthesize evidence on the neurobiological foundations, differential diagnosis, and educational implications of SLD, guiding clinical and pedagogical practice. Development: Dyslexia shows alterations in left temporo-parietal phonological networks and, in some cases, in the dorsal magnocellular-visual pathway, suggesting a multisystem disorder. Dyscalculia is associated with intraparietal sulcus dysfunction and altered numeric-mnemonic connectivity. Dysgraphia may be linguistic (phonological-orthographic deficit) or motor (dyspraxia/DCD), linked to working memory and executive function impairments. Comorbidities (e.g., ADHD) further complicate cognitive profiles and interventions. Strategies such as the Response to Intervention model support early detection, while Universal Design for Learning and assistive technologies promote educational inclusion. Continuous teacher training and socio-emotional learning programs are essential to mitigate negative effects and foster resilience. Conclusions: SLD require comprehensive diagnosis, evidence-based interventions, and inclusive adaptations. Combining early screening, targeted support, accessible environments, and teacher training enhances academic and psychosocial outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize identification and intervention protocols, particularly regarding dyscalculia and emerging technologies.",

Validity is problematic because diagnosis is entirely based on signs and symptoms; there are no biological markers for any of the major mental disorders. Clinicians can under-diagnose or overdiagnose disorders, but the problem of overdiagnosis is more prevalent and more problematic. At the present state of knowledge, psychiatry does not need hundreds of diagnoses, only a few of which have established validity. Overdiagnosis is an attempt to short-circuit a process of scientific discovery that will require many more decades of research.",

From an epidemiological point of view, normality can be seen as the person being within the mid-range of a bell shaped curve of normal population distribution.Abnormality typically has a negative connotation or meaning like being anomalous, aberrant, deviant, odd, etc. A person has a mental disorder if the person suffers from a disturbance of thought, mood, volition, perception, orientation or memory that impairs judgment or behaviour to a significant extent. Psychiatric diagnosis usually refers to a statement specifying required symptoms and signs, their onset, duration, reaction to treatment and possible outcome. The main practical purposes of diagnosis in psychiatry are communication between mental health professionals and statistics of mental disorders. The reliability of psychiatric diagnoses is sometimes questionable and their validity can be dubious and arbitrary. Current work is underway by the International College of Person-centered Medicine (ICPCM) in collaboration with other major international organizations in order to overcome these limitations using a model of Person-Centred Integrative Diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Sometimes concussion is accompanied by an abrupt change in behavior, including psychosis or dementia, but concussion is not necessarily the cause. It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

This paper presents the neurological approach to such patients highlighting the clinical clues that need to be sought to decide whether the patient is in a persistent vegetative or minimally conscious state (i.e., showing any responsiveness to external stimuli), or alternatively suffering from a locked-in syndrome. This neurological clinical formulation is then assimilated with other tests and assessments from a range of medical specialities, and by so doing helps confirm the clinical impression. This multidisciplinary approach is vital in the assessment of such patients and ideally should also include neurophysiological and functional imaging paradigms.",

Seu diagnóstico, muitas vezes, é desafio clínico devido aos seus variados padrões de apresentação; por essa razão, pode ser negligenciado não apenas por médicos gerais, mas também em alguns casos por neurologistas. Vários sintomas, incluindo dor de cabeça grave, visão anormal, desmaio ou perda de consciência, fraqueza da face, membros e convulsões podem ocorrer. Embora possa ser apresentada com diferentes sintomas neurológicos, na TVC normalmente não ocorrem alucinações.Relato de CasoUm homem saudável de 59 anos foi internado com queixas de episódios recorrentes de dor de cabeça no último mês e subsequentes alucinações visuais, especificamente prosooometamorfopsia - ele relatou ter visto imagens distorcidas de rostos e objetos. Não foi associado a nenhuma reclamação sensorial ou motora. O exame médico e neurológico geral na admissão estava intacto, incluindo estado mental, exame fundoscópico, nervos cranianos, motor, sensorial, coordenação e reflexos. Ele não tinha meningismo. O exame de sangue revelou uma alteração na proteína C-reativa (9,4 mg/L) e o líquido cefalorraquidiano apresentou apenas pleocitose linfocítica. Realizada a tomografia computadorizada de crânio que mostrou uma lesão cortical hipodensa mal definida na região temporal e occipital direita. A ressonância magnética confirmou a presença de trombose venosa cerebral nos seios sigmoides e transversais. Paciente foi tratado com heparina de baixo peso molecular seguido de varfarina, mas as alucinações visuais permaneceram. Optou-se por iniciar corticosteroide. Após excelente recuperação dos sintomas, em uma investigação mais aprofundada para trombofilias, ele foi considerado positivo para a mutação no gene da protrombina. O paciente assinou o Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido e foram utilizados apenas prontuários médicos para a elaboração desse relato.ConclusãoPor essa razão, as ilusões devem ser adicionadas ao já amplo espectro de apresentação clínica da trombose venosa cerebral. Esse diagnóstico pode ser considerado, ainda, em pacientes que apresentam alucinações auditivas e visuais súbitas, particularmente no contexto de cefaleia e com fatores de risco convencionais para trombose venosa cerebral.",

      "abstract": "As discussed in Chapter 1, for many young people, exacerbation of manic or depressive symptoms occurs through a spiral of contributing factors, both biological and psychosocial. Specifically, a young person may have an underlying biological or cognitive vulnerability to bipolar disorder, which results in the reduced effectiveness of the person's “shock absorbers” for significant events. Therefore, when a significant event occurs, he/she may experience more marked cognitive, behavioral, or affective change than would someone without the disorder. Following this, he/she may experience either decreased social or occupational functioning or social withdrawal leading to depression, or increased activity and sleep disruption resulting in mania. These changes may in turn exacerbate the initial mood state, and lead to a cycle towards more marked symptomatology (see Figure 6.1).",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY, BODY PERCEPTION AND MOTOR AND SENSORY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

      "abstract": "Any pain experience results from the interaction of biological and functional (namely, psychological and environmental) factors. In some cases functional factors may be primarily responsible for exacerbating and maintaining pain, therefore, the physician should be attentive to a variety of signs that may indicate a significant nonorganic component to the patient's pain. Problems in case management commonly arise when the organic signature is blurred, for pain patients are notoriously resistant to any suggestion that their pain is not purely organic in origin. Clinical experience has shown that the diagnosis and treatment of pain patients can be greatly facilitated by educating the patient about the complex nature of pain and by integrating the assessment of functional factors into the overall diagnostic work-up.",

This straightforward and pragmatic definition of psychological problems is offered as an alternative to the current medical model view in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> and the <italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic> that dominates thinking about psychological problems in most of the world today. Psychological problems are not the result of terrifying illnesses of the mind.

Easy life style, including physical activity, healthy dietary habits as well as good mental health are characterized by an efficient immune response. Life style is related to the type of occupational activity since work has a central part in life either as source of income or contributing to represent the social identity. Not only occupational stress, but also job loss or insecurity are thus considered serious stressful situations, inducing emotional disorders which may affect both neuroendocrine and immune systems; reduced reactivity to mitogens and/or decreased blood NK cytotoxic activity was reported in unemployed workers or in those with a high perception of job insecurity and/or job stress. Although genetic factors have a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, occupational stress (as in night shifts) was reported associated to an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders. Monitoring blood NK response may thus be included in the health programs as an indirect index of stressful job and/or poor lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is a symptom whose causes are protean and whose phenotype includes physical, mood, and behavioral components. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.",

One of the common referral queries to clinicians of people with ID – ‘Is this a mental illness or just a problem behaviour?’ – tends to stir up more discussion. At one extreme, attempts to understand maladaptive behaviours are merely descriptive and simply default to the ID itself. For example, aggression or self-injurious behaviour is said to be a product of the individual's cognitive disability and does not warrant a ‘diagnosis’. At the same time, the degree to which an individual is held accountable for his behaviour is also placed into consideration, as is the appropriateness of pharmacotherapy, depending on the answer to the referral question.",

      "abstract": "The brain reciprocally communicates with the rest of the body via neural, endocrine, immune, and other systems. This is crucial for coordinating the complex behavioral and physiological responses needed to cope with the many challenges of life. The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is a key brain structure involved in assessing rewards and threats, as well as activating appropriate responses. This is a dynamic process that depends on evolving needs and challenges. Important challenges include illness or injury. These typically involve inflammation and pain, which evoke neuroinflammatory processes in the brain to drive sickness behaviours. In the short term, sickness behaviours are considered adaptive, as they promote convalescence (e.g. low mood; lethargy, fatigue, social withdrawal), and enhanced threat appraisal (e.g. anxiety) to combat increased risk/vulnerability associated with sickness. Chronic inflammation, however, appears to remodel the system to inappropriately activate threat-coping responses, resulting in depressive and/or anxious phenotypes. These mood disorders are particularly pronounced in diseases and disorders associated with gut dysfunction, which feature chronic inflammation and altered ACC function. We propose that chronic inflammation remodels ACC physiology such that it errantly predicts heightened danger based on a mental model (a.k.a &amp;lsquo;schema&amp;rsquo;) of the world. This evokes chronic activation of threat-coping systems, including endocrine signaling (e.g. adrenaline), and anxiety. Inflammation can be driven by brain systems involving ACC, leading to a feedback-cycle that self-reinforces pathological states. This theory accounts for a wealth of clinical and preclinical data that implicate the ACC in disorders of mood and gastrointestinal function, and reveals a key player in the gut-brain axis that may represent a novel therapeutic target.",

Each of these symptom types is probably related to different brain processes that are altered in the depressed state. A further line of investigation is in the exploring of these brain processes. Even if the symptoms presenting in the patients are not able to discriminate between the underlying aetiologies, it is possible that associated neurocognitive deficits do. Depression is a disorder of mood, cognition, and behaviour with associated disturbance of brain structure and function. Psychomotor retardation reflects ventral striatum-cortico-thalamic network dysfunction and is associated with severe depression. There is decreased hippocampal volume and disturbed memory and learning in depression. Amygdala–anterior cingulate networks normally responsible for emotion regulation are disturbed in depression. Cognitive distortions seen in depression have associated abnormalities in prefrontal regions. Neurocognitive characteristics can distinguish between unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "title": "Neurocognición y resultado funcional en el trastorno bipolar con síntomas psicóticos",
      "abstract": "El trastorno bipolar (TB) es considerado un trastorno mental grave que se caracteriza por la presencia de alteraciones del estado de animo que siguen un curso recurrente, y puede estar asociado a un deficit neurocognitivo y funcional que esta presente incluso durante los periodos de remision sintomatica. Mas del 50% de los pacientes con TB no consiguen alcanzar la recuperacion funcional, de forma que constituye una de las cinco causas principales de discapacidad dentro del grupo de las enfermedades relacionadas con los trastornos mentales y el consumo de sustancias. Ademas, el TB se caracteriza por su heterogeneidad, tanto desde una perspectiva clinica, neurocognitiva y funcional, como desde un punto de vista neurobiologico. Asi, encontramos pacientes cuyo funcionamiento neurocognitivo y psicosocial es similar al de los controles sanos (CS), mientras que otros presentan un severo deterioro neurocognitivo y funcional. Las causas del deterioro neurocognitivo y funcional de los pacientes con TB no estan claras. Se ha sugerido que variables clinicas, como la duracion de la enfermedad, la edad de inicio, el numero de ingresos, el numero de episodios, especialmente el numero de episodios maniacos o la presencia de una historia de sintomas psicoticos podrian estar relacionadas con el grado de deterioro. La esquizofrenia (ESQ), por otra parte, tambien se caracteriza por una marcada heterogeneidad y por un deterioro neurocognitivo y funcional. Se ha sugerido que los pacientes con TB que tienen una historia de sintomas psicoticos (TB-Ps) podrian constituir un subtipo fenotipicamente homogeneo caracterizado por un grave deterioro neurocognitivo y funcional, de forma que este grupo de pacientes estaria mas proximo a los pacientes con ESQ que a los de los pacientes con TB sin sintomas psicoticos (TB-NPs). Sin embargo, hasta el momento actual no hay resultados concluyentes que permitan sustentar esta hipotesis Por otra parte, numerosos estudios han senalado que el curso del deterioro neurocognitivo y funcional de los pacientes con TB tiene un caracter estable. Sin embargo, no se puede descartar la existencia de un subgrupo de pacientes con caracteristicas clinicas especificas, como la presencia de sintomas psicoticos, que presente un deterioro progresivo. Sin embargo, no se han llevado a cabo estudios longitudinales especificamente disenados para examinar esta hipotesis. El objetivo de esta tesis doctoral es analizar la trayectoria del funcionamiento neurocognitivo y psicosocial de pacientes con TB-Ps, en comparacion con pacientes con TB-NPs, pacientes con ESQ y CS. En ultima instancia pretendemos aumentar nuestros conocimientos sobre ambos trastornos, contribuyendo a definir de una manera mas precisa sus limites. Asimismo, esperamos que nuestros resultados contribuyan a aclarar si pacientes con TB, y pacientes con ESQ pueden compartir estrategias de rehabilitacion cognitiva y psicosocial o si, por el contrario, son necesarios programas de rehabilitacion especificos para cada uno de estos grupos, en base a un distinto patron de deficits neurocognitivos y funcionales. Para ello, fueron evaluados clinica, cognitiva y funcionalmente 100 pacientes diagnosticados de TB tipo I (DSM-IV/SCID-I), que cumplieron rigurosos criterios de eutimia, divididos en dos subgrupos dependiendo de la presencia o ausencia de psicosis a lo largo de la vida, 50 pacientes con ESQ y 51 CS. Los cuatro grupos fueron evaluados durante un periodo de seguimiento de 5 anos. Los resultados indicaron que: 1) los pacientes con TB-Ps, TB-NPs y ESQ mostraron un marcado deterioro neurocognitivo, que fue similar desde el punto de vista cualitativo. Las diferencias fueron solo cuantitativas, principalmente circunscritas a la memoria de trabajo; 2) los pacientes con TB tuvieron un deterioro psicosocial clinicamente significativo, que es independiente de la presencia de una historia de sintomas psicoticos. La disfuncion neurocognitiva y la sintomatologia depresiva subumbral fueron las variables que explicaron un mayor porcentaje de la varianza del resultado funcional; 3) El curso del funcionamiento neurocognitivo y psicosocial en pacientes con ESQ y TB, incluyendo los que tienen una historia de sintomas psicoticos, fue estable. Estos resultados indican que los pacientes TB, con y sin sintomas psicoticos, y los pacientes con ESQ, tienen un perfil de deterioro neurocognitivo similar y podrian beneficiarse de las mismas estrategias de rehabilitacion cognitiva y funcional. Estos resultados permiten resaltar la importancia de las actividades dirigidas a mejorar la funcion neurocognitiva en el TB, asi como la necesidad de llevar a cabo intervenciones dirigidas a reducir la sintomatologia depresiva.",

      "abstract": "Patients with movement disorders experience fluctuations unrelated to disease progression or treatment. Extrinsic factors that contribute to the variable expression of movement disorders are environment related. They influence the expression of movement disorders through sensory-motor interactions and include somatosensory, visual, and auditory stimuli. Examples of somatosensory effects are stimulus sensitivity of myoclonus on touch and sensory amelioration in dystonia but also some less-appreciated effects on parkinsonian tremor and gait. Changes in visual input may affect practically all types of movement disorders, either by loss of its compensatory role or by disease-related alterations in the pathways subserving visuomotor integration. The interaction between auditory input and motor function is reflected in simple protective reflexes and in complex behaviors such as singing or dancing. Various expressions range from the effect of music on parkinsonian bradykinesia to tics. Changes in body position affect muscle tone and may result in marked fluctuations of rigidity or may affect dystonic manifestations. Factors intrinsic to the patient are related to their voluntary activity and cognitive, motivational, and emotional states. Depending on the situation or disease, they may improve or worsen movement disorders. We discuss various factors that can influence the phenotypic variability of movement disorders, highlighting the potential mechanisms underlying these manifestations. We also describe how motor fluctuations can be provoked during the clinical assessment to help reach the diagnosis and appreciated to understand complaints that seem discrepant with objective findings. We summarize advice and interventions based on the variability of movement disorders that may improve patients' functioning in everyday life. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

      "abstract": "Thoughts, feelings, and moods can have a significant effect on the onset of some diseases, the course of many, and the management of nearly all.Many visits to the doctor are occasioned by psychosocial distress. Even in those patients with organic medical disorders, functional health status is strongly influenced by mood, coping skills, and social support, yet the predominant approach in medicine is to treat people with physical and chemical treatments that neglect the mental, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of illness. This critical mismatch between the psychosocial health needs of people and the usual medical response leads to frustration, ineffectiveness, and wasted health care resources. There is emerging evidence that empowering patients and addressing their psychosocial needs can be health and cost effective. By helping patients manage not just their disease but also common underlying needs for psychosocial support, coping skills, and sense of control, health outcomes can be significantly improved in a cost-effective manner. Rather than targeting specific diseases or behavioral risk factors, these psychosocial interventions may operate by influencing underlying, shared determinants of health such as attitudes, beliefs, and moods that predispose toward health in general. Although the health care system cannot be expected to address all the psychosocial needs of people, clinical interventions can be brought into alignment with the emerging evidence on shared psychosocial determinants of health by providing services that address psychosocial needs and improve adaptation to illness.",

The importance of altered mental status is yet further magnified by its prevalence, as one of the most common reasons to receive acute medical care. The term altered mental status, however, represents an especially complex constellation of symptoms, a label applied by clinicians that simultaneously consolidates and oversimplifies different patient concerns and clinical syndromes that can be due to disparate causes within and outside of the nervous system.[1] This complexity can provoke nearly as much confusion in clinicians as patients themselves.",

While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

      "abstract": "Modified state of consciousness (MSC) is defined as a mental state that can be subjectively recognized by an individual or by an objective observer of the individual, as representing a difference in the psychological functioning of the “normal” state, alert and awake of the individual. Drugs are products with definitions and conceptual boundaries, historically defined. The use of psychoactive drugs is related to the increased plasticity of human subjectivity which is reflected in various technical means to change the perception, cognition, affect and mood. The authors propose to conduct a literature review on the types of MSC, the way to achieve them and their implications in drug consumption pattern. A MSC consists of dimensions such as self-oceanic limitlessness, agonizing self-dissolution and visionary restructuring. Normal MSC includes dreams, hypnagogic state and sleep. Others may be induced by hypnosis, meditation or psychoactive substances. Those achieved by drugs allow the subject to access feelings and sensations which go beyond the everyday reality or, on the other hand, leakage of reality. Anthropological studies show that in almost all civilizations, man sought ways to induce MSC. What characterizes the problematic or abusive use of certain substances is not necessarily the amount and frequency of drug use, but the disharmony in the socio-cultural, family and psychosocial contexts of the individual.

      "abstract": "Introducción: Ciertos sectores económicos en pandemia establecieron el decremento de la carga física de los trabajadores, relacionadas con sus tareas de carácter manual; éstas a la vez, fueron reemplazadas por el incremento permanente de actividades vinculadas a funciones cognitivas y psicosociales que se corresponden íntimamente a la carga mental, que se constituye en uno de los factores de mayor influencia para el riesgo laboral y adquiere gran interés, esencialmente por las nuevas formas de organización del trabajo; así como también, los avances tecnológicos e informáticos, que demandan de mayores esfuerzos cognoscitivos e intelectuales. La carga mental genera tensiones en el trabajador, provocadas por distintas variables concernientes a los requerimientos laborales; dada la relación que se produce entre éstas y las capacidades mentales o recursos propios de la persona para afrontarlas, junto con los procesos cognitivos y aspectos afectivos del individuo.Se han descrito efectos en la salud y ciertos componentes de riesgo mental se expresan como síntomas depresivos y estrés, afines con otros elementos específicos de las profesiones como: agotamiento, cansancio físico y fatiga generalizada, lesiones musculares, perturbación del sueño y exposición a situaciones y comportamientos de violencia en el contexto laboral. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), ha reconocido que el bienestar de los trabajadores, no solo se condiciona por peligros en el lugar de trabajo, sino también por factores sociales e individuales. Las consecuencias que surgen a raíz de los intentos por superar las condiciones precarias que enfrenta el trabajador, llevan a una connotación negativa de las cargas físicas, psíquicas y fisiológicas, que a futuro se manifiestan en cargas mentales excesivas difíciles de manejar lo que genera un decrecimiento en la productividad. En Ecuador, las políticas públicas, no han considerado aún la salud mental como parte de la salud pública; de ahí, la necesidad de iniciar su discusión, análisis y propuesta.Objetivo: El estudio tiene como propósito fundamental determinar los factores asociados a la carga mental de los docentes de diferentes niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico, conforme a la normativa vigente ecuatoriana.Materiales y Métodos: Se aplicó una metodología con enfoque cuantitativo. Fue aplicado el cuestionario CarMen-Q que evalúa cuatro dimensiones de carga mental: dimensión cognitiva, temporales, requisitos de desempeño y aspectos emocionales. Consta de 29 ítems, con un formato de respuesta mediante Escala Likert. El instrumento se aplicó en línea a 111 docentes de Ecuador de niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico. Para analizar los resultados se recurrió a técnicas estadísticas multivariantes como Análisis de Componentes Principales y estadística descriptiva para análisis de los datos socio demográficos.Resultados: Los resultados sugieren que los factores asociados a la carga mental, se relacionan con la gestión de información, la dimensión emocional, carga laboral y la presión por rendimiento, al que deben responder en este caso los docentes de las instituciones educativas investigados.Conclusiones: Los docentes enfrentan dificultades para responder a las demandas de las tareas. Estas, están directamente relacionadas con las dimensiones cognitivas, de rendimiento y temporales, sin dejar de lado, aquellas vinculadas con la subjetividad humana como corresponde a las emociones, sentimientos y vivencias, más aún cuando el ejercicio de la docencia involucra la interacción directa entre seres humanos.",

      "abstract": "Stroke dianggap sebagai masalah besar yang tengah dihadapi hampir di seluruh dunia, penyakit stroke merupakan salah satu penyebab kematian yang utama baik di negara-negara maju maupun negara berkembang. Di daerah Surakarta saja jumlah pasien penderita stroke saat ini bisa dibilang cukup tinggi, data yang diperoleh dari ruang ICU RSUD Dr. Moewardi Surakarta, dalam dua bulan terakhir (Januari – Februari 2009), tercatat ada 36 pasien stroke yang mengalami kondisi kritis.\r\nMenurut Smeltzer dan Bare (2002), stroke adalah kelainan fungsi otak yang diakibatkan oleh berhentinya suplai darah ke bagian otak. Manifestasi klinis yang timbul dari stroke antara lain: kehilangan motorik, kehilangan komunikasi, gangguan persepsi, kerusakan fungsi kognitif dan efek psikologi, disfungsi kandung kemih. Sedangkan masalah keperawatan yang muncul: gangguan perfusi serebral tak efektif berhubungan dengan penurunan aliran darah serebral, gangguan mobilitas fisik berhubungan dengan kelemahan neuromuskuler, gangguan komunikasi verbal berhubungan dengan kerusakan otak pada area broca. \r\nHasil dari asuhan keperawatn yang diterapkan pada Ny. P didapat evaluasi : klien mengatakan masih pusing tapi merasa lebih nyaman, klien tampak bedrest dengan posisi kepala ditinggikan 15o, tekanan darah: 170/100 mmHg. Klien mengatakan tubuh sebelah kanan tidak dapat digerakkan, keluarga mengatakan dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan dasar klien dibantu keluarga. Klien mengatakan (secara sederhana) paham dengan apa yang dimaksud perawat, klien tampak masih sulit untuk berbicara (pelo), klien berusaha untuk mengungkapkan apa yang dirasakan. Dari hasil evaluasi tersebut, didapat kesimpulan bahwa masalah-masalah keperawatan yang dialami Ny. P baru teratasi sebagian.\r\n\r\nMetode yang digunakan adalah wawancara dan observasi",

This is partly because the nervous system is a communications system with direct access to consciousness, so that the patient is in a unique position to monitor his own disorder. Clinical diagnosis becomes very difficult in the presence of dysphasia, confusion or dementia. Another reason is that useful biochemical and histological information about the function of neurons is rarely available, in contrast to the wealth of data used in the assessment of diseases of other organs, such as the lungs, liver or kidneys. The failure of neurons in the CNS to regenerate means that delay in making a precise diagnosis can worsen the eventual outcome; the clinician often cannot afford to watch how an illness progresses before intervening.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome. Therapeutic interventions include cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on exploration of attitudes toward hope and meaning in life.",

Method: Narrative review. Results: FCD is common in neuropsychological practice. It is characterized by cognitive symptoms that are not better explained by another medical or psychiatric disorder. The cognitive symptoms are associated with distress and/or limitations in daily functioning, but are potentially reversible with appropriate identification and treatment. Historically, a variety of diagnostic frameworks have attempted to capture this condition. A contemporary conceptualization of FCD positions it as a subtype of Functional Neurological Disorder, with shared and unique etiological factors. Patients with FCD tend to perform normally on neuropsychological testing or demonstrate relatively weak memory acquisition (e.g. list learning trials) in comparison to strong attention and delayed recall performance. Careful history-taking and behavioral observations are essential to support the diagnosis of FCD. Areas of ongoing controversy include operationalizing \"internal inconsistencies\" and the role of performance validity testing. Evidence for targeted interventions remains scarce. Conclusions: Neuropsychologists familiar with FCD can uniquely contribute to the care of patients with this condition by improving diagnostic clarity, richening case formulation, communicating effectively with referrers, and leading clinical management. Further research is needed to refine diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.",

      "title": "Promoting Physical Activity in People with Brain Impairments",
      "abstract": "Brain impairment is defined as a significant loss or abnormality in the brain structure. Brain impairments may be acquired as a result of trauma (e.g., traumatic brain injury or stroke), non-traumatic origins (e.g., tumour) or disease (e.g., Parkinsonrs disease or multiple sclerosis) or congenital (e.g., cerebral palsy) and are frequently associated with abnormal brain function (e.g., impaired memory, executive function and/ or impaired motor control). Evidence indicates that physical activity is beneficial for individuals with brain impairment as the subsequent loss of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and flexibility that occurs as a result of inactivity can compound the effects of the initial disability. Current cross-sectional evidence indicates that individuals with brain impairment are significantly less active than individuals without brain impairment. In order to address the low levels of physical activity in adults with brain impairment and thereby improve health, fitness and functioning, it is critical to develop interventions which effectively promote physically active behaviour in this population. The overall aim of the program of research described in this thesis is to contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based physical activity promotion strategies in individuals with brain impairment. This thesis presents studies relating to two major subpopulations of people with brain impairment: adolescents with cerebral palsy (Chapters Three and Four); and adults with brain impairment (Chapters Five and Six). Chapter Three presents a systematic review of the clinimetric properties of objective and subjective measures of physical activity in adolescents with cerebral palsy. Seven measures were included in this review. Each measure had notable limitations related to the assessment of physical activity intensity and duration and compliance with the physical activity guidelines. The review identified accelerometry as a promising means of measuring physical activity as it is objective and can collect real-time activity data on the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity, allowing for meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Four presents a study that evaluated the validity of the ActiGraph accelerometer for the measurement of physical activity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. Results indicated that the ActiGraph is able to differentiate between different intensities of walking and that, for the purpose of classifying activity intensity, the cut-points developed by Evenson et al. for typically developing children had excellent classifaction accuracy for detecting moderate to vigorous physical activity. These findings indicate that the ActiGraph is a suitable device for measuring free-living ambulatory physical activity among children and adolescents with cerebral palsy and that the output can be used to make meaningful comparisons to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Five presents a systematic review of the research relating to physical activity and adults with brain impairment mapped against the five phases of a behavioral epidemiological framework. Results indicated that the vast majority of research to date has focused on identifying the benefits of physical activity for people with brain impairment; that measures previously used to evaluate physical activity participation do not allow meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines; that the evidence relating to correlates of physical activity has been largely concerned with levels of impairment and self-efficacy and; there is a relative paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions that promote physically active behaviour in this population. Currently there are no studies that evaluate the translation of physical activity interventions previously shown to be successful in controlled efficacy or effectiveness studies into widespread practice. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that future studies should consider a community-based rehabilitation model of intervention and that the rigor of such studies would be enhanced by the use of objective measures of physical activity. Chapter Six presents the results of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a physical activity promotion intervention for community-dwelling adults with brain impairment. The intervention utilised elements of a community-based rehabilitation approach to deliver a lifestyle intervention to community-dwelling adults with brain impairment and outcomes were evaluated using an objective measure of physical activity. After the 12-week program, intervention participants exhibited significant increases in average counts per minute (cpm) (60.9 p 20.7 cpm, p= .004) and daily average time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (10.4 p 4.0 mins MVPA, p= .01). Daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity declined significantly among attention controls (-11.1 p 22.9 cpm; -2.6 p 4.5 mins MVPA). Net differences in daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity were 71.9 cpm (p= .02) and 12.9 mins MVPA (p= .03), respectively. Between-condition differences in the physical activity outcomes were not significant at 3-months follow-up. These findings are noteworthy given the particularly low rates of physical activity participation in this population and the significant physical and environmental barriers that individuals with brain impairment face. Given the rigour of the study, the results are sufficiently positive to warrant conducting a larger scale effectiveness trial utilising trained practitioners in clinical practice settings.n",

      "title": "Resonancia magnética funcional en la evaluación del dolor pélvico crónico en la mujer",
      "abstract": "Introduccion El dolor pelvico cronico es un dolor no ciclico con una duracion minima de seis meses localizado en la pelvis anatomica, pared abdominal anterior o por debajo del ombligo, espalda lumbosacra o nalgas y de suficiente gravedad como para causar una discapacidad funcional o solicitar atencion medica por este motivo. La investigacion del dolor es un campo que ha adoptado el uso de tecnicas de imagen cerebral, desde la tomografia por emision de positrones hasta estudios de imagenes por Resonancia Magnetica funcional. Estudios de neuroimagen han demostrado que los cambios en la actividad cerebral que a menudo acompanan al dolor pelvico cronico, afectan especialmente a areas del cerebro relacionadas con la percepcion del dolor y la modulacion del mismo. La actividad cerebral tambien debe reflejar la experiencia y el aprendizaje dependientes de los cambios debidos a la presencia del dolor, como el movimiento fisico, la funcion diaria o el estado de animo, subyacentes a la patologia especifica y a las consiguientes modificaciones cognitivo-conductuales. Objetivo Lo objetivo general de nuestro estudio es caracterizar los hallazgos en las imagenes por Resonancia Magnetica funcional cerebral en mujeres con dolor pelvico cronico, describiendo las alteraciones especificas de esta patologia segun la enfermedad causante y teniendo en cuenta su estado psicosomatico. Material y metodologia Entre enero de 2014 a mayo de 2016 se reclutaron, en la consulta de Algia Pelvica de la Unidad de Gestion Clinica de Obstetricia y Ginecologia del Hospital Universitario San Cecilio de Granada, 48 mujeres que cumplian criterios diagnosticos de dolor pelvico cronico. Para un subanalisis y caracterizacion del grupo de estudio, se reclutaron 38 mujeres como controles sanos que aceptaron participar. Las fuentes de informacion del estudio fueron: Cuestionario de la Sociedad Internacional de Algia Pelvica modificado; el Cuestionario de depresion de Beck; Inventario de Ansiedad Rasgo-Estado (IDARE); el Cuestionario de calidad de vida EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D); y ecografia abdominal y transvaginal. En las mujeres diagnosticadas de sindrome de congestion pelvica se realizo la embolizacion de las venas gonadales en la Unidad de Radiologia Intervencionista del Hospital Universitario San Cecilio de Granada. Para el analisis de los datos se utilizo el programa estadistico para las Ciencias Sociales (SPSS) 20.0 para Windows. Se obtuvieron frecuencias y porcentajes para las variables cualitativas, asi como las medias y las desviaciones estandar para las variables cuantitativas. Para el analisis de imagenes por Resonancia Magnetica funcional cerebral se realizo un estudio observacional transversal, seleccionando a 13 mujeres con dolor pelvico cronico del grupo anterior que cumplian los criterios para la realizacion de las pruebas de imagen y aceptaron participar. Estas pruebas se realizaron en la Unidad de Resonancia Magnetica del Centro de Investigacion Mente, Cerebro y Comportamiento (Universidad de Granada, Espana). El procedimiento de obtencion de las imagenes asi como del test del dolor experimental utilizado fue una modificacion del procedimiento del cold pressor test tradicional – el Cold pressor gel test. El preprocesamiento de la imagen y el analisis de los datos funcionales se realizaron con el programa SPM8 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, Reino Unido). Resultados Existen una serie de factores asociados al perfil clinico de mujeres con dolor pelvico cronico, entre ellos un bajo nivel educativo y la situacion de desempleo, ademas de que es mas frecuente encontrar en estas pacientes antecedentes de consumo de sustancias psicoactivas como tabaco, drogas o farmacos psicotropicos y antecedentes de cirugia abdominal previa, acompanandose con mayor frecuencia de disfunciones sexuales y uso frecuente de analgesicos. Es caracteristica la prolongada duracion del dolor junto con una intensidad percibida del mismo bastante elevado, lo que puede agravar las consecuencias en la salud a todos los niveles. La etiologia de esta enfermedad es muy variada y con frecuencia se asocian diferentes patologias en la misma paciente. Es de destacar el sindrome de congestion pelvica, que debe ser una entidad a tener en cuenta en el diagnostico del dolor pelvico cronico. La ecografia es una herramienta sencilla, inocua y reproducible para el diagnostico de esta enfermedad y la embolizacion de venas gonadales una opcion terapeutica eficaz. En la evaluacion de las pacientes con dolor pelvico cronico es imprescindible la valoracion desde un punto de vista psicoafectivo, ya que es muy frecuente la asociacion con niveles elevados de ansiedad, presencia de depresion y, por supuesto, una mala calidad de vida, y por tanto una mala percepcion del estado de salud. Aunque en el grupo de pacientes evaluadas en este Trabajo de Tesis Doctoral no hay un gran numero de pacientes con antecedente de abuso sexual y/o fisico, debe incluirse en la valoracion, ya que esta frecuentemente asociado al desarrollo de dolor pelvico cronico y su enfoque terapeutico debe ser especifico. Es importante senalar, por tanto, la necesidad de un abordaje concreto para el tratamiento de la depresion y la ansiedad conjuntamente con el tratamiento etiologico de la enfermedad, para mejorar todos los aspectos senalados. El Cold Pressor Gel Test es un test de dolor experimental accesible y facilmente reproducible. Tiene la ventaja de ser rentable, seguro y compatible con la resonancia magnetica. Nuestro estudio de imagenes por Resonancia Magnetica funcional proporciona evidencia de que en mujeres con dolor pelvico cronico, durante la estimulacion con un dolor experimental, se produce una activacion en determinadas areas cerebrales diferentes dependiendo del estado psicosomatico. Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que el estudio de la activacion del dolor podria ayudar a definir los cambios psicosomaticos en la percepcion dolorosa en condiciones de dolor cronico y, finalmente, en la orientacion de la terapia del dolor. Adicionalmente, la duracion del dolor, ademas del estado psicosomatico, parecen modular esta respuesta, no asi la etiologia de la enfermedad, lo que sugiere una independencia en el procesamiento del dolor cuando este se cronifica. Por ultimo, las causas multifactoriales y las consecuencias multidimensionales del dolor pelvico cronico en la mujer, fuerzan a plantear estrategias de tratamiento con un modelo de cuidado integral e individualizado para cada mujer, cubriendo todo el proceso como un todo, considerando no solo la causa del dolor, sino tambien el mecanismo de su desarrollo y los factores asociados. El tratamiento del dolor debe pasar de tratar un sintoma a tratar una enfermedad que afecta en gran medida a la calidad de vida.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "abstract": "This paper does not attempt to review the whole topic of clinical efficacy but will consider general concepts, particularly in the light of the advent of the serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The aetiology of depression is complex. In most cases there is some form of predisposition based on problematical family dynamics, disordered family communication and/or genetic factors; each may be present to a variable extent. On top of this predisposition, some form of stimulus - ‘stress’, an external problem, loss of control, a physical disorder, adverse life circumstances - appears to affect those who are already primed. There are a variety of possible outcomes from this combination of predisposition and stimuli: low mood, depression in the full syndromic sense, and depression with biological features. It seems likely that, particularly with severe depressions (the major syndromic forms and those with biological features), there are neuroendocrine and neurochemical changes to mediate the effects of stress into those of the clinical symptoms and signs. It has been hypothesised that stressors induce adaptive neurochemical changes, failure of which may engender behavioural disturbances (Anisman &amp; Zacharko, 1992). However, there are also many individuals who may not undergo this process, but who probably have some cognitive or learned change leading to dysphoria; this aspect needs to be considered carefully in relation to efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder that makes an individual responsive to negative stimuli as higher cognitive functions of the brain of the individual like perception, attention, memory related functions, planning, decision making etc. are seriously challenged by the causes like excessive stresses in life, serious illness, loss of self-esteem, certain medications etc. Erroneous information processing in the brain of depressive individuals attaches them to the feelings of loss, sadness and hopelessness. In extremely stressful situation the cognitive functions of the depressive individuals may impaired to such an extent that they may have the feeling of entrapment for which they may take the way of suicidal acts for escape. A number of brain regions that are involved in higher cognitive functions are altered in depression patients, suicidal individuals and in complete suicides. Along with the morphological changes, monoaminergic neurotransmission system is also severely deteriorated in these brain regions indicating their possible involvements in regulating cognitive activities. Monoaminergic dysfunctions may give rise to serious cognitive impairments and deterioration of associated mental functions required for maintaining normal internal homeostasis. Loss of cognitive functions makes an individual incapable to interact properly to various aspects of normal life functions making them depressive and severe depression may be the forerunner of suicidal acts.",

      "abstract": "Psychological disorders that follow traumatic brain injury are possibly more complex and diverse than those associated with other forms of \"brain damage\". These may include organic aggressive, or organic affective syndromes that are episodic in nature and therefore require a more specific diagnosis, a different classification, and a different approach to treatment. Consequently, it is necessary for clinicians to learn to distinguish between \"primary\" psychiatric illnesses and those disorders of behavioural control and mood that stem specifically from brain injury. There is relatively little in the clinical literature that explains the relationship between variable states of behaviour, mood or temperament, and clinical disorders that may have long-term implications for patient management. This concept paper therefore addresses abnormalities of mood and behaviour that are episodic in character and are not recognisably included in the DSM and ICD classifications of psychological or psychiatric disorders.",

Nevertheless, this is the picture that can be produced by an increased serum viscosity.<sup>1,2</sup>The bleeding characteristically occurs from the nose, mouth, or gums but may stem from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Postoperative oozing is also common. Ocular symptoms range from partial to complete loss of vision due to retinal hemorrhages, venous changes, or even papilledema. The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

      "abstract": "Acute physical restraint represents a potent Stressor in several animal species and is accompanied by a complex pattern of hormonal responses and functional changes in the central nervous system. Repeated immobilization leads to partial blunting of the behavioral and hormonal responses, with transient modifications of neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Pain reactions, as investigated by different kinds of nociceptive tests, are usually attenuated both during and immediately following acute immobilization and the analgesic effect of opiate compounds potentiated; these behavioral alterations may be attributed at least in part to activation of an endogenous opioid system. In some species, restraint may induce a reflex immobility (animal hypnosis or tonic immobility) which is also characterized by suppression of pain reactions in rabbits, probably subserved by different mechanisms. Analysis of available data suggests that pain testing in unanesthetized, restrained animals may involve alterations of the animal's reactivity to noxious stimuli.",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

Con el objetivo de llevar a cabo un buen diagnóstico diferencial proponemos un protocolo clínico con una evaluación neuropsicológica breve de las funciones que pudieran estar diferencialmente afectadas en todos esos síndromes, como atención, praxias y lenguaje.

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

Dentre esse quadro clinico, destaca-se a dor cronica, como caracteristica mais marcante, podendo levar a incapacidades laborais e declinio na qualidade de vida.\r\nA fisiopatologia da FM ainda e desconhecida, mas acredita-se que existe uma alteracao no mecanismo central de controle da dor, o qual poderia resultar de uma disfuncao dos neurotransmissores2. Assim, essa disfuncao acarretaria uma deficiencia no sistema de neurotransmissores inibitorios em niveis espinhais ou supraespinhais (serotonina, encefalina e noradrenalina), ou uma hiperatividade de neurotransmissores excitatorios (substância P, glutamato e bradicinina)3.\r\nAtraves da analise dos registros do eletroencefalograma (EEG), pode-se observar nas areas envolvidas no processamento da dor, uma hiperexcitabilidade representando um mecanismo importante na manutencao deste sintoma na FM1. Nesse contexto, alteracoes no EEG tem sido relacionadas a um biomarcador fisiologico em sindromes dolorosas distintas. Achados de perfis electroencefalograficos de grupos populacionais com dor cronica estao sendo avaliados com o intuito de elucidar a fisiopatologia da dor e promover a avaliacao e monitoramento do tratamento da dor1.\r\nEmbora alguns estudos envolvendo o uso do EEG para avaliacao da dor cronica tenham mostrado que existem algumas caracteristicas semelhantes entre individuos que sofrem de diversas sindromes dolorosas, os dados permanecem inconclusivos1.

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales.

Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation.

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure.

Sometimes cumulative or potentiating effects are associated with clinical and paraclinical confusing manifestations induced by one of the components of the lesion complex, or by mutually aggravating effects. It is also the case of vertebromedular traumas associated with other post-traumatic lesions, where the neurological signal is distorted, and may induce particularities of associated lesions. Posttraumatic spinal shock, autonomic dysreflexia and motor, sensory and autonomous after effects, bring distortions of the neurogenic signal, which will significantly affect other traumatized territories, generating clinical manifestations and atypical reaction elements. The prototype of this post-traumatic morbid association is represented by the lesion complex vertebromedular trauma - abdominal trauma.",

      "title": "Functional cognitive disorder: dementia’s blind spot",
      "abstract": "Abstract An increasing proportion of cognitive difficulties are recognized to have a functional cause, the chief clinical indicator of which is internal inconsistency. When these symptoms are impairing or distressing, and not better explained by other disorders, this can be conceptualized as a cognitive variant of functional neurological disorder, termed functional cognitive disorder (FCD). FCD is likely very common in clinical practice but may be under-diagnosed. Clinicians in many settings make liberal use of the descriptive term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for those with cognitive difficulties not impairing enough to qualify as dementia. However, MCI is an aetiology-neutral description, which therefore includes patients with a wide range of underlying causes. Consequently, a proportion of MCI cases are due to non-neurodegenerative processes, including FCD. Indeed, significant numbers of patients diagnosed with MCI do not ‘convert’ to dementia. The lack of diagnostic specificity for MCI ‘non-progressors’ is a weakness inherent in framing MCI primarily within a deterministic neurodegenerative pathway. It is recognized that depression, anxiety and behavioural changes can represent a prodrome to neurodegeneration; empirical data are required to explore whether the same might hold for subsets of individuals with FCD. Clinicians and researchers can improve study efficacy and patient outcomes by viewing MCI as a descriptive term with a wide differential diagnosis, including potentially reversible components such as FCD. We present a preliminary definition of functional neurological disorder–cognitive subtype, explain its position in relation to other cognitive diagnoses and emerging biomarkers, highlight clinical features that can lead to positive diagnosis (as opposed to a diagnosis of exclusion), and red flags that should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. In the research setting, positive identifiers of FCD will enhance our recognition of individuals who are not in a neurodegenerative prodrome, while greater use of this diagnosis in clinical practice will facilitate personalized interventions.",

      "title": "Does Your Patient Have a Psychiatric Illness or Nonverbal Learning Disorder? Clinical Clues Help Differentiate Overlapping Symptoms and Syndromes",
      "abstract": "Patients who present with impairment in academic, cognitive, social, and vocational functioning might be struggling with an unrecognized learning disorder. Ten percent of the US population has some form of learning disability, and up to 40% of those with learning disorders may meet diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. (1), (2) Some learning disorders affect a person's ability to read, write, or do math, whereas less - recognized nonverbal learning disorder (NLD) impacts the social and emotional functioning of children, adolescents, and adults. Common features of NLD include: * deficits in nonlinguistic information processing * speech prosody deficits * difficulty reading facial expressions * associated impairment in interpersonal functioning. The severity of these deficits varies among individuals with NLD. Patients may experience chronic low self-esteem, anxiety, and mood symptoms because of their limited ability to express their feelings within an appropriate social context. NLD may be first misdiagnosed as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), or Asperger's disorder. In this article we review the underlying neurophysiology of NLD and present a clinical approach to these patients, including the differential diagnosis and factors that will allow clinicians to distinguish NLD from psychiatric conditions with symptomatic and syndromic overlap. We also describe treatment for patients with NLD. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Table 1 Clinical manifestation of nonverbal learning disorder Tactile - perceptual deficits and psychomotor coordination deficiencies, usually more marked on the left side Visual - spatial organization deficits Deficiencies in nonverbal problem solving, such as hypothesis testing and understanding cause - effect relationships Difficulty adapting to novel situations and reliance on rote behaviors Relative deficiencies in mechanical arithmetic with proficiencies in reading, word recognition, and spelling Well developed rote verbal - memory skills Verbosity characterized by poor pragmatics Deficits in social perception, judgment, and interaction source: reference 7 The learning process Learning is a cognitive process of acquiring and processing information and experiences from the environment that allows us to acquire knowledge, skills, and social abilities. When we learn how to relate to others, we undergo neurophysiology changes that subsequently influence behavior and the way we understand our environment. Deficits in learning processes or the ability to acquire relational skills result in impaired affect regulation in regard to others and may lead to low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, interpersonal conflict, and anger toward others. Learning influences a person's ability to navigate social relationships and perform academically and occupationally. The impact of learning deficits may be magnified in adulthood after an individual has suffered years of insecurities and poor self-esteem. Adults with learning disabilities often seek psychiatric treatment as a result of their disappointment about difficulties in relationships and work. NLD may coexist with or mimic other neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, problematic behavior within a family or at the workplace I is a common reason for referral to a psychiatrist. These behaviors may be influenced by a patient's NLD symptoms, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Persons with NLD are at increased risk for depression because of failures in coping, loss of self-esteem, internalized psychopathology, and other social and emotional strains. In addition, individuals with NLD may experience multiple psychosocial impairments, including difficulty maintaining employment, achieving goals, and maintaining relationships. …",

      "abstract": "O presente estudo teve como objetivo fornecer informações sobre a fisiopatologia, manifestações clínicas e os impactos físicos, sociais e emocionais que influenciam na qualidade de vida de idosos portadores doença de Parkinson. A doença de Parkinson é considerada uma enfermidade neurodegenerativa crônica e progressiva que limita a independência nas atividades funcionais e na qualidade de vida dos pacientes podendo causar uma série de desafios. Apresenta sintomatologia complicada, com disfunções de ordem motora, como fortes tremores de mãos, pés e corpo, rigidez muscular, alterações posturais, desequilíbrio, incontinência urinária, alterações na fala, entre outros. É caracterizada, também, por manifestações não motoras, como as sensitiva-sensoriais, autonômicas, afetivas, cognitivas, comportamentais e do sono, que poderão causar incapacidades e contribuir com a dependência do portador. A qualidade de vida atua como um indicador nos conceitos clínicos de doenças específicas por meio da avaliação do impacto físico e psicossocial que algumas enfermidades podem gerar, possibilitando assim um melhor conhecimento do paciente e de sua adaptação a determinada condição. Devido à possibilidade de incapacidade produzida pelos sintomas da doença, é fundamental a adoção de estratégias para melhorar a qualidade de vida dos portadores, como adoção de recursos terapêuticos complementares. Foi realizado um levantamento bibliográfico através de busca eletrônica de trabalhos científicos que nos possibilitou perceber que, devido ao caráter progressivo e degenerativo da doença é preciso que profissionais da área de saúde estejam atentos para conhecer e indicar maneiras adequadas para prevenir e minimizar os efeitos da enfermidade, proporcionando aos portadores manutenção/ melhoria qualidade de vida.",

      "title": "The Behavioural Dimension of Brain Disorders-An Area for Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a branch of medicine with a relatively short history. Although mental illness has probably existed throughout the history of mankind, it has received little attention from the medical perspective. Major psychoses have been considered as either spiritual or functional until recently. The functional or organic dichotomy has been the official watershed dividing the disciplines of Neurology and Psychiatry. While Neurology follows the basic medical approach, Psychiatry takes a much broader, and perhaps more diffuse, perspective. During the past few decades, there has been a quantum leap in the volume of basic neuroscientific research. A much better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying most, if not all, psychiatric disorders has led to a revolutionary change in the concept of mental disorders. Most functional or psychogenic problems have now been found to have an 'organic' aetiology. Functional psychiatric disorders are much better perceived as medical disorders leading to disturbances in brain function. Clinical manifestations are disturbances of the integration between mood, perception, and thought processes. The old distinction between diseases as either neurological or psychiatric faces challenges to its validity. It would be over-simplistic to assume that brain disorders will manifest either along the neurological or psychiatric dimension, and be managed with a single approach. In this issue, the significance of a combined neuropsychiatric approach to the assessment and management of brain disorders is highlighted. The article on depressive disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) underscores the prevalent psychiatric co-morbidity in this classical neurological disorder. (1) Discovery of degeneration of the dopaminergic system in this disorder led to the development of an associated treatment. It is well-recognised that PD is readily amenable to pharmacological interventions that bolster dopaminergic transmission. Nevertheless, the focusing of attention on the motor symptoms of PD is associated with a neglect of other important determinants of quality of life, such as depressive disorders and other psychopathology. The report on mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) provides an excellent example of the complex neuropsychiatric manifestations of a rare metabolic brain disease. (2) In MELAS, a combination of neurological and psychiatric symptomatology, and use of sophisticated neuroimaging and laboratory technology are required to make the diagnosis. It is perhaps meaningless to argue about the importance of paying dual attention to the neurological and psychiatric aspects of brain disorders. A more intriguing question may be the need for a division between Psychiatry and Neurology, or more specifically, the distinction between Behavioural Neurology and Neuropsychiatry. …",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

      "abstract": "Functional (conversion) neurological symptoms represent one of the most common situations faced by neurologists in their everyday practice. Among them, acute or subacute functional weakness may mimic very prevalent conditions such as stroke or traumatic injury. In the diagnosis of functional weakness, although elements of the history are helpful, physical signs are often of crucial importance in the diagnosis and positive signs are as important as absence of signs of disease. Hence, accurate and reliable positive signs of functional weakness are valuable for obtaining timely diagnosis and treatment, making it possible to avoid unnecessary or invasive tests and procedures up to thrombolysis. Functional weakness commonly presents as weakness of an entire limb, paraparesis, or hemiparesis, with observable or demonstrable inconsistencies and non-anatomic accompaniments. Documentation of limb movements during sleep, the arm drop test, the Babinski's trunk-thigh test, Hoover tests, the Sonoo abductor test, and various dynamometer tests can provide useful bedside diagnostic information on functional weakness. We therefore present here a brief overview of the positive neurological signs of functional weakness available, both in the lower and in the upper limbs; but none should be used in isolation and must be interpreted in the overall context of the presentation. It should be borne in mind that a patient may have both a functional and an organic disorder.",

These data indicate the difficulty to use the available cognitive resources of the patient. These alterations are similar to those present in other hypersomnias, although they might differ in intensity. Moreover, most of the studies emphasize a high prevalence of different depressive and anxious disorders. It has been suggested that predisposition to anxiety could be part of the characteristic phenotype of these patients. Anxiety could act either as a trigger for the disease or a consequence of the disease.Cognitive deficits in patients with NT1 appear in long lasting and/or monotonous tasks and in high cognitive demanding tasks. The presence of depressive symptomatology, together with excessive daytime sleepiness in these patients could affect their performance in neuropsychological test, and it might be related to their subjective perception of the cognitive deficits.Alteraciones neuropsicologicas en la narcolepsia con cataplejia: una revision.Objetivo. Describir el estado actual de conocimiento sobre los principales deficits cognitivos que presentan los pacientes con narcolepsia con cataplejia o narcolepsia de tipo 1. Desarrollo. La mayoria de los estudios ha encontrado que las funciones cognitivas mas afectadas son la atencion (especialmente el mantenimiento de la atencion o atencion sostenida), la velocidad de procesamiento de la informacion y las funciones ejecutivas (en particular, la fluidez verbal y la resistencia a la interferencia de estimulos). Estos datos indican una dificultad para utilizar los recursos cognitivos de los que dispone el sujeto. Estas alteraciones son similares a las presentes en otras hipersomnias, aunque difieren en la intensidad. Por otra parte, la mayoria de los estudios destaca una elevada prevalencia de diferentes trastornos depresivos y ansiosos. Se ha sugerido que la predisposicion a la ansiedad forma parte del fenotipo caracteristico de estos pacientes. La ansiedad podria actuar como un factor desencadenante de la enfermedad y ser asimismo una consecuencia de la enfermedad. Conclusiones. Los deficits cognitivos en los pacientes con narcolepsia de tipo 1 se manifiestan en tareas de larga duracion o monotonas y en tareas con alta demanda cognitiva, principalmente en tareas de atencion sostenida. La presencia de sintomatologia depresiva en estos pacientes, junto con la excesiva somnolencia diurna, parecen afectar a su rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas, y estar estrechamente relacionadas con la apreciacion subjetiva de dificultades cognitivas.",

Psychosis is a group of disorder characterized by thought disorder, abnormal behaviour, defective cognition, delusion and hallucination. Adverse drug reaction is defined as any undesired or unintended effects of drugs treatment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)- “adverse drug reaction (ADRs) has been defined one which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease, or modification of physiological function”. Adverse drug reactions are the most important causes of the mortality and morbidity. Antipsychotics are the most effective drugs which are used in the psychiatry in the maintenance therapy of mania, psychoses and schizophrenia. The antipsychotics drugs are chemically disparate but have the common property of alleviating the symptoms of organic as well as functional psychosis. But they also have a capacity to cause a wide range of potential adverse drug reactions that can lead to non-compliance that can impair quality of life, may cause the extra pyramidal symptoms which can lead to discontinuation of therapy and in extreme cases it may be fatal. Knowledge of assessment of ADRs due to different antipsychotics is necessary. It helps to choose to safe treatment and reduce the risk of occurrence of ADRs by the clinicians. ADR are often poorly identified and reported in day to day medical practice. As we collect more and more information about ADRs, we need an active surveillance system regarding identification and reporting of ADRs with antipsychotic drugs.

Colucci, AuD, MAThis system considers diagnosis, functional symptomatology, physical findings, and epidemiology and clinical studies as the bases for assessment, allowing for standardization across modalities and organ systems, and for rating decisions to be more uniform across patients. HEARING LOSS DOESN'T STAND ALONE People with hearing loss are at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating activities of daily living, especially when patients are older and have other sensory or motor comorbidities. Each physical or mental challenge adds a layer of impairment to the whole person. For example, adding a cognitive disability or a psychological condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation to hearing loss would increase the whole person impairment (WPI). A patient with hearing loss and tinnitus has ratings for each, with the possibility of additional ratings from the mental and behavioral domains for debilitating tinnitus, hyperacusis, or misophonia. To the clinician, hearing loss does not stand alone in the overall health of a person and should be weighed against all factors that affect engagement or isolation because auditory training and neuroplasticity maintenance are daily activities. Understanding the workings of the WPI system is useful for rating how the impairment affects quality of life and, specifically, activities of daily living. This approach is helpful from a number of standpoints, both clinical and legal. The percentage of WPI varies across systems. For example, the functional loss of an eye converts to 16 percent WPI, and the loss of one ear's function is 7 percent WPI. Bilateral profound deafness is rated at 35 percent WPI, while 95 percent vision loss is 100 percent WPI. In the last case, vision loss is considered more of an impairment because it reduces daily functionality, visual mobility, and reading, and requires significant accommodations. Deafness does not prevent mobility or the ability to take care of oneself. For binaural hearing loss WPI, the calculations, originally developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO–HNS) for a moderate hearing loss, work like this: First, calculate the monaural impairment: Pure-tone average (PTA) = [(0.5 kHz + 1 kHz + 2 kHz + 3 kHz)/4] = dB HL Then, deduct the first 25 dB of loss, and multiply the remainder by 1.5 percent: (dB HL – 25 dB) x 1.5% = impairment For example, if right-ear values are 45, 50, 50, and 55, respectively, right-ear impairment is: (45 + 50 + 50 + 55)/4 = 50 50 – 25 = 25 25 x 1.5% = 37.5% If left-ear values are 40 for all frequencies, left-ear impairment is: (40 + 40 + 40 + 40)/4 = 40 40 – 25 = 15 15 x 1.5% = 22.5% Second, calculate binaural impairment: [5(Better Ear) + Worse Ear]/6 [(5 x 22.5) + 37.5]/6 = 25% Finally, see Table 11-3 of the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment and select the rating for 25 percent binaural impairment or 9 percent WPI. PROVIDE APPROPRIATE PRESCRIPTIONS The guide is not designed to establish work eligibility, restrict someone from performing a desired skill, or deny access, but rather as an index to set forth a diagnosis and percentage of physical or functional loss, establish permanent loss, and provide a hierarchy of classification for long-term conditions. The taxonomy of classifying impairments such as vertigo is broken into five severity classes based on history, physical examination, and diagnostic or objective findings, with Class 0 signifying minimal impairment and Class 4 the most severe. The fact that hearing loss was recently qualified as a risk factor for accelerating brain aging by reducing brain volume and cognitive abilities increases the importance of hearing loss to the medical professions. Since all advanced hearing technologies essentially have the same outcomes, providing appropriate prescriptive and verification/validation measures is mandatory for every audiologist. As hearing changes, so do communication ability, cognitive function, and psychological factors of depression and disorientation, affecting quality of life and the whole person, not just hearing.",

The correlates of emotional incapacities, emotional hypersensitivity, and normal emotional activities in psychopaths are studied and discussed in this paper. Emotional hypersensitivity might be linked with: a history of neglect, rejection and abuse; insult; changes which are forced or not under control of the psychopath; obstacles that prevent the psychopath to do what he or she wants to do; narcissistic injury; broken friendships or relationship. Normal emotional functioning might be associate with grief, warm relationship, adequate attention, disease, academic and/or occupational success, impressive events, confrontations, contemplation and maturation, hidden suffering (also as a result of neurobiological determination).",

Pain may be due to various disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system or muscles of different etiologies. There is a continuum from slightly unpleasant sensory disturbances to nociception. Differential diagnosis must be sought according to topological and pathophysiological interpretation of the clinical findings. This will determine the necessary diagnostic requirements and therapeutic procedures. Within the central nervous system lesions of the nociceptive projections of the spinal cord or brain may lead to pain in the lower limbs. Furthermore, different pathologies of the peripheral nervous system (root, plexus, peripheral nerve) or muscles can cause pain.

      "title": "Depression and resilience: insights from cognitive, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacological studies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

      "abstract": "Aims: Serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) are important monoamine neurotransmitters that are ubiquitously distributed throughout the peripheral and central nervous system and modulate functions that are vital to survive. Both neurotransmitters may be involved in the pathophysiological process or the treatment of – at first glance – divergent disease areas, namely stress urinary incontinence, major depressive disorder and neuropathic pain. The present review aims at describing the neurophysiological similarities between these disease areas, focussing on the role of the neurotransmitters 5-HT and NA at synapses of the spinal and supraspinal neural circuitry. Results/discussion: Recent clinical studies show convergence of symptoms (i.e. comorbidity) for incontinence, depression and pain, suggesting common biochemical imbalances. Duloxetine, a dual serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, has a central mechanism of action at different locations in the central nervous system and has proven to be a sound treatment of all these different diseases. Data obtained from animal model studies, randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials, as well as open label trials have provided evidence of the efficacy and safety of duloxetine as a suitable compound for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in women as well as major depressive disorder and diabetic neuropathic pain in both men and women.",

These remote effects result from deafferentation, a phenomenon known as \"diaschisis\". After an interval of time, which will vary directly with the severity of the lesion, functional recovery occurs due to synaptic reactivation of neurones. This is favourably influenced by rehabilitation. Diaschisis most commonly manifests itself by such neurological signs as impaired consciousness or cognitive impairments including dementia, dyspraxias, dystaxias, dysphasias, incoordination and sensory neglect. The nature of diaschisis has been demonstrated by widespread depressions of local cerebral blood flow and metabolism extending far beyond the anatomical lesion. Recovery of function is associated with recovery of local perfusion and metabolism. [Neurol Res 1993; 15: 362-366]",

      "title": "Sensorimotor Deficits Associated with Chronic Ankle Instability",
      "abstract": "Kim, Kyung-Min. Sensorimotor Deficits Associated with Chronic Ankle Instability. Exercise Science, 23(4): 287-296. 2014. Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a common debilitating condition in sports medicine that contributes to dysfunction and disabilities. A significant portion of patients with ankle sprains develops CAI, resulting in recurrent injuries and an increased likelihood to develop a degenerative disease like ankle osteoarthritis. CAI may be due to either mechanical or functional insufficiencies, or both. The mechanical contributing factors are pathologic joint laxity, arthrokinematic restrictions, synovial inflammation and impingements, and degenerative changes. The functional insufficiencies include impairments in proprioception, alpha motoneuron pool excitability, reflex actions, strength, postural control, walking and running mechanics, and jumping and landing mechanics, which indicate alterations in the sensorimotor system. It may be intuitive that mechanical disruptions of the lateral ligaments in the ankle joint following an ankle sprain cause changes in joint mechanics, leading to the joint instability, but it is not clear how sensorimotor deficits arise from mechanical injury to the ankle. Recent evidence showed that deficits in postural control and alpha motoneuron recruitment might be more influential, however, each of the sensorimotor deficits play a role in CAI. Thus, the purpose of this review is to discuss the relevant literature surrounding chronic ankle instability with an emphasis on deficits in postural control and alpha motoneuron pool excitability, and to provide insight into rehabilitation for CAI patients suffering from sensorimotor dysfunction.",

Im Rahmen der weiteren Entwicklung stellt sich eine ständige Wechselwirkung zwischen der neurologischen Störung und den persönlichen kompensatorischen Möglichkeiten (motorisch, kognitiv, verbal) ein. Dies führt zu einem immer stärker werdenden individuellen Mischbild. Die Problematik der Kinder wird durch eine unterschiedlich ausgeprägte Wahrnehmungsstörung und Wahrnehmungsverarbeitungsstörung (Perzeptionsstörung) zusätzlich erschwert.",

      "title": "Quantification of walking mobility in neurological disorders",
      "abstract": "Difficulty in walking is a major feature of neurological disease, and loss of mobility is the activity of daily living on which patients place the most value.1 Consequently, how to measure and assess this is of importance to any member of the inter-disciplinary team. In clinical practice, the World Health Organization international classification of functioning (ICF)2 is often adopted as the underlying framework for the assessment of mobility, which is an individual's ability to move about effectively in their environment.2 The ICF also introduces the constructs of performance (what an individual does in his environment) and capacity (ability to execute a task or action). This has a clear impact on the current methodology for the assessment of mobility.\n\nDifferent pathologies and impairments culminate in abnormal or reduced walking. For instance, in multiple sclerosis (MS), impairments such as weakness and spasticity from pyramidal tract lesions, loss of proprioception and co-ordination from dorsal column and cerebellar lesions, vestibular and visual dysfunction, cognitive and mood disturbance and pain may all contribute (Figure 1). In primary muscle disease, mobility is determined by weakness but secondary factors such as weight gain, contractures, fatigue and breathlessness may have important impacts. The degree of impairment has a non-linear relationship with activity and participation. For example leg strength and walking speed are poorly correlated,3 while many personal and environmental factors may influence the impact of similar degrees of loss of walking on mobility. Figure 1. \nFramework of international classification of function (ICF) as illustrated by mobility in MS.\n\n\n\nImpaired walking can be a marker of both disability and disease progression, and is therefore an important outcome measure in the treatment and rehabilitation of diseases such as MS and Parkinson's disease (PD). In some cases, measurement of mobility may have a direct influence on access to treatment. … \n\nAddress correspondence to Dr O.R.

Aber auch klassische Präsentationen im Sinne von Depressionen oder Psychosen können durch immunologische Enzephalopathien verursacht werden. In Zusammenschau von Labor-, Bildgebungs- (MRT, ggf. FDG-PET), EEG- und Liquorbefunden kann die Diagnose einer immunologischen Enzephalopathie gestellt werden. Insbesondere dem Nachweis von Antikörpern gegen neuronale Zelloberflächenantigene oder intrazelluläre synaptische/onkoneuronale Antigene kommt eine wesentliche Bedeutung zu. Eine Tumorsuche und ggf. Behandlung ist in vielen Fällen angezeigt. Eine Tumorresektion kann in solchen Konstellationen eine genuin kausale Therapie der neuropsychiatrischen Symptomatik darstellen. Immunmodulatorisch kommen eine hoch dosierte Steroidbehandlung, Plasmapherese oder intravenöse Immunglobuline (First-Line) zum Einsatz. Bei fehlendem Ansprechen können Behandlungsversuche mit Rituximab oder Cyclophosphamid (Second-Line) erwogen werden. Das Erkennen von immunologischen Enzephalopathien im psychiatrisch-psychotherapeutischen Alltag ist wichtig, da potenziell lebensbedrohliche Erkrankungen vorliegen, oftmals eine Tumorassoziation besteht, eine im Vergleich zur klassischen psychiatrisch-medikamentösen Behandlung unkonventionelle bzw. innovative Behandlungsoption (Immuntherapie) vorliegt und diese Erkrankungen unter adäquater Behandlung potenziell reversibel sind.",

Cognitive enhancers can improve intellectual function and have been approved for Alzheimer’s dementia, dementia of Parkinson’s disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive enhancers are being developed for other cognitive disorders. There are many advantages for development of symptomatic cognitive enhancers compared to disease-modifying agents. Cognitive enhancers typically modulate transmitter systems. Cross-disease phenotypes such as executive function impairment may represent a development strategy for cognitive enhancing agents. Life cycle management strategies for cognitive enhancers include expanding indications to disorders with related pathophysiology or to different stages of disease severity and development of alternate formulations. Cognitive enhancers can restore essential cognitive capability and are a critical element of optimal care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",

Such outcomes are considered potentially more sensitive and specific to important therapeutic effects, and may be more linked to disability and disease-related life losses than conventional assessments of impairment (e.g. ability to walk, performance on language tests, serological or radiological indices). Self-report is invaluable to identify social and emotional consequences of brain injury: depression, changes in intimate and family relationships, social role and community participation losses. However, common stroke-related neuropsychological deficits are likely to confound subjective stroke outcome measures. The scientific community focused on stroke-related health outcomes may arrive at significantly underestimated patient reports of stroke-related disability, caused by a failure to adjust for the effect on self-report of spatial neglect, deficits of magnitude estimation, pathologic alteration of self-awareness, and alteration in distributed cortical systems supporting emotional semantics and abstraction.",

      "title": "Dissociative Disorders",
      "abstract": "Commonly encountered in people with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses (and in many people without a diagnosis), dissociative symptoms can affect consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, and behavior. Dissociative experiences are common, affecting perhaps half the population at some point. Although they are common, symptoms can be vaguely experienced and poorly recalled, so they are often overlooked by clinicians. Many or most dissociative episodes are fleeting or do not cause significant distress or dysfunction, and therefore do not warrant a specific DSM-5 diagnosis. Nevertheless, identification of dissociative experiences can help make sense of sometimes-confusing symptoms. DSM-5 describes three specific dissociative disorders—dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder—as well as two more general categories of dissociative disorder—other specified and unspecified. All are frequently associated with physical, emotional, and/or sexual trauma and abuse, and it is not at random that the DSM-5 chapter on dissociative disorders is located immediately after the chapter that focuses on trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) refers to the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Formerly known as \"multiple personality disorder,\" DID involves a discontinuity in the sense of self and the sense of agency, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. DID also involves memory gaps that transcend ordinary forgetting. Some cultural groups may view DID as \"possession\" by spiritual beings external to the person, but the disturbance should not be diagnosed as pathological if it conforms to broadly accepted cultural or religious practices. Furthermore, DID is generally not applicable to children who have imaginary playmates or who are otherwise engaging in normal imaginative play. As is often the case with all dissociative disorders, people with DID tend to present with other psychiatric issues, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-epileptic seizures. Patients may conceal or not be aware of memory gaps and other discontinuities, which further complicates the psychiatric evaluation. In contrast to DID, which involves organization of different personalities via dissociative processes, other dissociative diagnoses are perhaps more common and less controversial. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability to recall important autobiographical information that is generally related to a specific stressor or trauma. It can be associated with nonepileptic seizures or other functional neurological symptoms (e.g., DSM-5-TR functional neurological symptom disorder [conversion disorder]). DSM-5 removed dissociative fugue as a separate disorder and included it as a specifier for dissociative amnesia. Fugue states are notable for the inability to recall important autobiographical memories (e.g., personal identity) and can include wandering away from home while maintaining an ability to function adequately. A detached and unreal sense of oneself (depersonalization) or the outside world (derealization) is relatively common, with a reported lifetime population prevalence of 50%. To meet criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder, however, the symptoms must be persistent (generally lasting at least 1 month) and/or recurrent. Reality testing should be spared. As with other DSM-5 diagnoses, impairment and/or distress is also required, so occasional \"spacing out\" is not necessarily a disorder. DSM-5 provides a diagnostic option—\"other specified dissociative disorder\"—for presentations that do not meet full criteria for DID, dissociative amnesia, or depersonalization/derealization disorder. For example, the diagnosis \"other specified dissociative disorder (identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion)\" can be given when an individual has dissociative effects following an intense experience such as brainwashing, long-term political imprisonment, or indoctrination into a cult. Acute dissociative reactions to stressful events can have a variety of dissociative manifestations when viewed cross-sectionally but are notable for their brevity; they can clear within days. If they persist for more than 1 month, the individual likely warrants a different diagnosis (e.g., depersonalization/derealization disorder).",

      "title": "Translational research in motor and sensory function of the upper GI tract",
      "abstract": "Translational research in motor and sensory function of the upper GI tract Niels van Lelyveld Background and aim: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common disorder seen in daily clinical practice, characterized by the presence of pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen in the absence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease. Since reliable markers are not available (anatomic or biochemical abnormalities), the diagnosis is based upon symptoms. It is well established that motoric and sensory abnormalities are highly prevalent in FD patients. The key issue here is, whether gastric (dys)function is related to specific upper abdominal symptoms, and can be regarded as a etiologic factor of FD. The clinical importance of this is evident, since gastric sensory or motor dysfunctions may serve as important therapeutic targets. The aim of the current thesis was to improve the understanding of the aetiology of dyspeptic symptoms. Methods: For that purpose, we have investigated: (1) the relationship between dyspeptic symptoms and gastric motor and sensory function, (2) molecular factors potentially underlying the gastroduodenal motor and sensory abnormalities and/or the generation of upper abdominal symptoms. We investigated the (patho)physiology of upper gastrointestinal motility and the generation of upper abdominal sensations in functional dyspeptic patients using several techniques; three-dimensional ultrasonography (3D-US) to study total and partial gastric volume changes, the C-octanoic breathtest for the measurement of gastric emptying, and the nutrient drinktest to determine maximum drinking capacity. In our attempt to identify molecular factors underlying the gastroduodenal motor and sensory abnormalities and/or symptoms we focused on serotonergic signalling. mRNA expression levels of genes encoding proteins involved in serotonergic signalling were quantified by real-time PCR in mucosal biopsy specimens. Furthermore, the genotype distribution of functional polymorphisms was analyzed. Results and conclusions: Although impaired proximal gastric relaxation and delayed gastric emptying are highly prevalent in this patient group, we were not able to establish a relationship between gastric (dys)function and upper abdominal sensations experienced in daily life. The results of this thesis question the role of these pathophysiologic mechanisms in the generation of dyspeptic symptoms. Therefore, we have concluded that limited effect on symptoms may be expected when targeting these specific mechanisms. Several components of mucosal serotonergic signalling are higher in the duodenum compared to the stomach. Therefore we conclude that serotonin, released by EC cells, predominantly contributes to gastroduodenal function at the level of the duodenum. Examination of serotonergic signalling components in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis revealed that delayed gastric emptying and upper abdominal symptoms do not result from altered mucosal 5-HT biosynthetic and uptake capacity. However, a decreased expression of the 5-HT4(c) splice variant in the duodenum of FD patients may exert a modest effect on 5-HT availability, and be of importance in the pathogenesis of gastroparesis. Interestingly, tertiary referral FD patients have a higher prevalence of the T allele of the GNB3 C825T polymorphism compared to healthy controls. Therefore, a second messenger abnormality may be one of the molecular factors underlying the gastric motor and sensory dysfunction and upper abdominal symptoms observed in FD.",

      "abstract": "The modern concept of stress is based on responses to events or factors (\"stressors\") experienced as aversive, threatening or excessive for maintaining physiological equilibrium of an organism. Prolonged exposure to stressors, particularly during early life, is strongly associated with later psychiatric disorders. Underlying mechanistic connections between stress responses and development of psychiatric illnesses remain uncertain and typically appear to be nonspecific. Relevant candidate mechanisms are likely to include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by sustained excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. In turn, this process is influenced by and alters various central neurotransmitter and other molecular signaling systems that include glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and neurotrophic peptides. Additional manifestations of stress include altered neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, as well as oxidative neuron-damaging effects. The complex molecular systems involved in these processes present many opportunities for innovative pharmacological interventions that may have preventive or therapeutic benefits regarding mental illnesses arising from stress.",

      "abstract": "Until not too long ago, psychogenic trance was considered to be a 'conversion hysteria'. But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

Its phenomenology is characterized by emotional, behavioural, cognitive, and physical symptoms. Recent advances in neuropharmacology and neuroimaging are clarifying the role of putative brain circuits in regulating mood. In this context, it appears that a relationship between the three monoamine neurotransmitters (i.e., serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and different malfunctioning neural circuits mediating specific clinical domains in MD does exist. Therefore, these symptoms may be targeted by using antidepressants that enhance monoaminergic transmission within the hypothetically brain structures involved. This, in turn, would improve the effectiveness of the treatment. It has been suggested, mostly on empirical evidence, that some dual-acting drugs, by extensively targeting both core and associated symptoms of MD, may offer some advantages, when compared with more selective antidepressants, in terms of clinical remission and improvement of patient's quality of life.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological triggering factors in musicians with focal dystonia",
      "abstract": "Focal dystonia is a\n neurological movement disorder which affects the fine motor control of a\n specific body location. In professional musicians, a limb or the embouchure\n involved in playing a musical instrument may be impacted. Focal dystonia in\n musicians (FDM) is characterised by a loss of\n voluntary motor control and can be a career-ending condition. The\n pathophysiology of focal dystonia, which remains incompletely understood, is\n mainly associated with dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits, with impaired\n inhibition and dysfunctions of sensorimotor pathways. FDM is triggered by various\n neuropsychological and environmental factors. However the existence of\n psycho-psychiatric comorbidities and their possible impact on and/or\n contribution to the manifestation of FDM remains under-investigated. Recent\n studies have revealed that motor function can be altered as a result of\n psychological or psychiatric conditions, suggesting common neurobiological\n networks. Studies conducted in other forms of focal dystonia have uncovered\n psychiatric or other psychological comorbidities such as obsessions, phobias,\n anxieties and depression, whereas a limited number of investigations with FDM\n patients have mainly indicated elevated levels of anxiety and perfectionism.\n The aim of the current thesis was to provide new insights into the\n psychopathology of focal dystonia and its possible consequences for motor\n performance in affected musicians. The investigation was divided into three\n different studies (chapters), each exploring a different aspect of the\n overall topic.\n The first chapter comprises\n a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the psychological profile of FDM\n patients based on standardised psycho-diagnostic\n instruments. Findings indicate that in comparison to healthy controls, half\n of the FDM patients exhibited elevated instances of psychological traits\n related to anxiety, perfectionism and dysfunctional stress-coping features.\n Furthermore, results suggest that these conditions pre-dated the onset of the\n disease and may have contributed as aggravating risk factors to the\n development of FDM. We suggest that the existence of FDM patients with and\n without psychopathology could reflect different mal-adaptive processes\n mediated via different circuits of the cortico-basal\n ganglia-thalamic loops.\n Most of the features in the\n FDM patients diagnosed with psychopathology were related to elevated levels\n of stress and anxiety. Therefore the second chapter focuses on the design of\n a complex experimental paradigm which examines physiological parameters\n (electro-myography [EMG] and fine motor\n performance) in relaxed and stressful conditions, in combination with\n objective assessments (electrocardiography [ECG], cortisol) of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\n (HPA) axis. Due to the fact that no similar paradigm has previously been\n implemented for patients with focal dystonia, a pilot study with a small\n number of patients was conducted. Findings suggest that the experimental\n design is feasible and serves its purpose.\n The final chapter\n encompasses a combined design derived from the first two chapters. Possible\n electrophysiological differences were examined i)\n between FDM patients and healthy controls, ii) among FDM patients before and\n after stress and iii) between\n patients with and without psychopathology. Findings indicate that FDM\n patients are characterised by increased sensitivity to psychosocial\n stressors, in comparison to healthy controls. The impact of stress is\n expressed as an increase in muscular co-contraction of the affected hand, which can be\n explained as a “natural” physiological response under stressful conditions. Finally,\n no motor outcome differences are found between patients with and without\n psychopathology, however results indicate that musicians with psychopathology\n had, on average, developed dystonia around a decade earlier than the\n remainder of the patients, emphasising the contribution of psycho-psychiatric\n conditions to the manifestation of dystonia. Summarising, the current\n thesis suggests the existence of psychopathology in about 50% of musicians\n with focal dystonia. FDM patients with and without psychopathology did not\n differ in their motor performance, however there is clear evidence that\n psychopathology can be an aggravating factor, which may accelerate or even\n trigger the manifestation of dystonia. The current thesis supports the\n concept that motor and psycho-psychiatric features share common\n neurobiological networks in patients with focal dystonia.",

      "abstract": "<ns4:p>Ingestion and digestion of food as well as expulsion of residual material from our gastrointestinal tract requires normal propulsive, i.e. motor, function. Hypomotility refers to inherited or acquired changes that come with decreased contractile forces or slower transit. It not only often causes symptoms but also may compromise nutritional status or lead to other complications. While severe forms, such as pseudo-obstruction or ileus, may have a tremendous functional impact, the less severe forms of hypomotility may well be more relevant, as they contribute to common disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, chronic constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Clinical testing can identify changes in contractile activity, defined by lower amplitudes or abnormal patterns, and the related effects on transit. However, such biomarkers show a limited correlation with overall symptom severity as experienced by patients. Similarly, targeting hypomotility with pharmacological interventions often alters gut motor function but does not consistently improve symptoms. Novel diagnostic approaches may change this apparent paradox and enable us to obtain more comprehensive information by integrating data on electrical activity, mechanical forces, patterns, wall stiffness, and motions with information of the flow of luminal contents. New drugs with more selective effects or more specific delivery may improve benefits and limit adverse effects. Lastly, the complex regulation of gastrointestinal motility involves the brain-gut axis as a reciprocal pathway for afferent and efferent signaling. Considering the role of visceral input in emotion and the effects of emotion on visceral activity, understanding and managing hypomotility disorders requires an integrative approach based on the mind-body continuum or biopsychosocial model of diseases.</ns4:p>",

      "title": "Toward a Dimensional Understanding of Psychosis and Its Treatment",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a mental state characterized by a set of perceptual, thought disorder, and cognitive symptoms and constructs that manifest themselves in several psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, but also in some neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, and in some medical diseases, especially endocrinological and metabolic conditions. Psychotic symptoms are characterized by a combination of hallucinatory experiences, delusional interpretations of reality, and frank thought disorder, often accompanied by thought and behavior disorganization. Psychotic symptoms are experienced by individuals as real cognitive and sensory occurrences and involve all sensory modalities (auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile). The most characteristic experience of psychosis is \"loss of reality,\" which represents the psychotic individual's unquestioned perception that his or her symptoms are real occurrences and not pathological mental constructs; this experience occurs particularly in psychiatric psychotic syndromes. The World Health Organization's International Psychosis Study (Carpenter et al. 1973) investigated whether psychotic symptoms vary around the world in different cultures and regions by examining psychosis in individuals across seven countries; the conclusion was that psychotic symptomatology spans continents, languages, and cultures with great similarity, albeit with great interindividual variability. Several first-person accounts written by brilliant and self-perceptive individuals with psychosis record the nature of psychosis and illustrate the profound loss of reality testing around psychotic experiences. John Nash described the nature of his delusion:These ideas just keep coming into my head. I can't prevent it. [I] believe that there is a conspiracy among military leaders to take over the world, and that [I] am in charge of the takeover. [I] secretly feel that I am the left foot of God. And that God is walking on the earth. (qtd. in Nasar 1998, p. 234)Elyn Saks (2007) detailed her experience of psychotic \"disorientation\" as follows:Consciousness gradually loses its coherence. The \"me\" becomes a haze. . reality breaks up like a bad radio signal. There is no longer a sturdy vantage point from which to look out, take things in, assess what's happening. No core lens through which to see the world, to make judgments and comprehend risk. Random moments of time follow one another. Sights, sounds, thoughts, and feelings don't go together. No organizing principle takes successive moments in time and puts them together in a coherent way from which sense can be made. And it's all taking place in slow motion. (p. 89)The clinical manifestations of psychosis are illustrated in these two examples, with evidence of hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, and disorganization. Psychosis is a disturbance of cognition, not a global loss of cognitive capacity as seen within dementing illnesses. Indeed, psychosis is a \"gain-of-function\" symptom, with increased associational productions, bizarre perceptual experiences, thoughts, and established memories with psychotic content. This is in contrast to the dementias, which are \"loss-of-function\" cognitive disorders, in which memory is reduced and thought processes are altered and frequently diminished. Because psychotic experiences appear entirely real to the person suffering them, it is easy for the individual to act on the psychotic perceptions (i.e., command hallucinations) or the delusional thinking, which can result in bizarre, illogical, or even dangerous behavior. Psychosis is a broadly expressed symptom set across many diagnoses and can be called an intermediate phenotype or a symptom complex that may have a unique and independent brain network and biology and its own genetic associations. One could argue that the intermediate phenotype of psychosis is a symptom dimension representing a final common pathway of cerebral dysfunction (we would argue that psychosis is secondary to a disorder of learning and memory mechanisms) even though it is generated by diverse etiologies. It is possible to conceive that this symptom set has its own unique and distinctive anatomy, pathophysiology, and molecular targets, as well as treatments, although this has yet to be demonstrated. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) system from the National Institute of Mental Health is a leading example of this reorientation. In the RDoC framework, dimensions of normal cognition and affect are the unifying, homogenous units that decompose to generate psychopathology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The autonomic nervous system innervates all organs, producing predominantly involuntary and automatic actions that are mediated by two principal efferent pathways, the sympathetic and parasympathetic, which are neurochemically and anatomically distinct. Numerous synaptic relays and neurotransmitters allow the autonomic control of organ function at local and central levels to be integrated with the requirements of the whole body. The peripheral and central components of the autonomic nervous system are frequently affected by diseases, conditions, or toxins. Autonomic disorders are described as (1) primary—without defined cause, including multiple system atrophy and acute/subacute dysautonomias; or (2) secondary—with specific defects or as a consequence of other conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Riley–Day syndrome, amyloid neuropathy, dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency, spinal cord injury, and many drugs.",

Proprietary and open-source clinical examination tools are available, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Mini-Cog. Physician judgment is necessary in selecting the most appropriate tool for an individual patient. These tools have varying sensitivity and specificity for neurologic and psychiatric disorders, but none are diagnostic for any mental status disorder. Each must be interpreted in the context of physician observation. The mental status examination is useful in helping differentiate between a variety of systemic conditions, as well as neurologic and psychiatric disorders ranging from delirium and dementia to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. There are no guidelines to direct further testing in the setting of an abnormal mental status examination; therefore, testing is based on clinical judgment.",

In ideal circumstances, this can be diagnosed in a clinical sensory examination as a decrease or total loss of sensation of one or several sensory modalities within the affected nerve distribution. While the negative symptoms and signs of hypoesthesia are essential for the diagnosis of a neuropathy, some patients also develop one or more positive sensory signs including pain, allodynia, paraesthesia, and hyperesthesia. Within the trigeminal distribution, these positive phenomena may severely interfere with vital and socially important functions, e.g. mimics, eating, speaking, teeth brushing, and kissing. The sensory hypoesthesia caused by sensory nerve fibre damage may be so subtle, however, that it cannot be detected in the rather crude clinical sensory examination.",

      "abstract": "Many GPs find the care of patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) challenging. Therefore, the WONCA Working Party for Primary Mental Health asked for MUS guidance for family doctors worldwide in order to improve the care of patients with MUS globally. This article is a summary of this guidance.\n\nMUS are physical symptoms that have existed for several weeks and for which adequate medical examination or investigation have not revealed any condition that sufficiently explains the symptoms. MUS is a working hypothesis based on the (justified) assumption that somatic or psychiatric pathology have been adequately detected and treated, but that the clinical condition presented by the patients was not adequately resolved. Any change in symptoms could be a reason to revise the working hypothesis of MUS.1 For some patients with physical symptoms, a somatic or psychiatric condition may be present. However, if the physical symptoms are more severe or more persistent, or limit functioning to a greater extent than expected based on the condition in question, they too are referred to as MUS.\n\nMUS can be seen as a continuum ranging from self-limiting symptoms to recurrent and/or persisting symptoms and symptom disorders.

On the one hand, a simple physical tissue trauma that has failed to heal, does not explain what is currently observed as chronic pain behavior. Psychological problems and/or secondary gain are associated factors, suggesting the lack of a physical disorder. Recent findings on the neural mechanisms of pain, indicate that there may be some individuals whose traumatic event may have sensitized certain neurophysiologic processes to interpret as pain, from experiences of otherwise ordinary sensory-perception events. These central sensitization events could be caused or aggravated by various combinations of trauma, psychological disorders, or secondary gain and may provide at least a partial explanation of why some persons may develop chronic pain, and others will not.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Conversion disorder (a term that describes what was previously called hysteria) refers to motor or sensory symptoms, or both, that resemble a neurological disease, but that do not originate from or cannot be explained by a known physical disease. Objectives To find reliable tools that can guide the difficult diagnosis of conversion disorder. Methods Bibliographic review Results The exact prevalence of the disorder is unknown. It is estimated that approximately 5% of referrals to neurology are for this disorder. Approximately one third of patients referred to the neurologist have symptoms that cannot be explained by an organic disease. Involuntary movements are the most common motor manifestations of the conversive syndrome, being tremor one of the most frequent manifestations. The first differential diagnosis of conversion disorder is neurological disease. It is currently not necessary for the diagnosis to assess whether or not the symptoms are produced intentionally, as the assessment of conscious intentionality is unreliable. The neurological examination is the fundamental tool for the diagnostic approach, being even more enlightening than the complementary tests. Hoover’s sign, Babinski’s combined leg flexion, plantar flexion of the ankle, tremor and its distraction and synchronisation manoeuvres, as well as the clinical differences between epileptic seizures and non-epileptic seizures of psychogenic origin, are some of the reliable tools for a correct diagnosis. Conclusions The diagnosis of the disease should be one of exclusion. There must be clinical data showing clear evidence of incompatibility with a neurological disease and conversion symptoms do not correspond to known physiological mechanisms and anatomical pathways.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "title": "Psychological and social factors at work: contribution to musculoskeletal disorders and disabilities.",
      "abstract": "Psychological and social factors at work may contribute to musculoskeletal disorders by the following processes: (i) Direct pathogenic effects by affecting physiological mechanisms, such as muscle blood vessels and hormonal secretion; (ii) by altering work procedures and thereby altering the biomechanical loads through changes in posture, movements, and exerted forces; (iii) by altering sensations, mood, and cognitions, and thereby influencing symptoms, consequences of symptoms, and functional impairment; (iv) by interfering with buffer mechanisms, reducing the tolerance to other exposures. Almost all hypotheses of direct pathogenic effects (i) of psychological \"stress\" on muscle pain, maintain that the pain results from muscle-cell activation. The mechanisms proposed for the generation of pain are related to effects of energy deficit or intracellular calcium accumulation, leading to muscle-cell damage. However, it has not been possible to find reliable causal associations between muscle activation and pain. Furthermore, during active coping behaviours, muscle blood flow generally increases, rendering hypoxia less probable. Other hypotheses propose that increase in muscle-cell activity in musculoskeletal disorders is a consequence of the pain or that the pain originates from interactions between blood vessels and nociceptive nerves of the muscle. Explanations of the pathogenesis of pain generally do not yet account for the activation of sensory nerves (the nociceptors) that mediate information of potential tissue injury to the nerve system. Psychophysiological mechanisms determine whether pain become chronic and the consequences of pain. Mechanisms of the spinal medulla may amplify or inhibit transmission in the nociceptive circuits. Attention and perception are determined by the appraisal of the threat value of sensations. Pain sensations that are appraised to signal threat of injury or disability, are maintained and amplified. Pain beliefs contribute to the cognitive appraisal process. Health care personnel play a central role in forming pain beliefs by the way they inform of potential risk factors at the workplace and by the way they perform interventions and prevention measures. Therefore, the occupational health personnel must possess specific knowledge of which psychological and social factors contribute to musculoskeletal disorders and how their own recommendations may prevent or promote chronic disabilities.",

Disability is in part a social role, and a simple medical model cannot explain the complex interactions of sociology, psychology, anthropology, medicine, economics, and law characteristic of the workers' compensation system. Psychiatrists functioning within and reciprocally shaped by this semi‐adversarial system will rarely encounter an ‘ideal’ patient. Factors in all areas of workers' lives, including those integral to the workers' compensation system, influence their movement along a health‐illness, ableddisabled axis. This paper identifies a number of interacting factors that may prolong, or even subvert, the recovery process following a work‐incurred injury or illness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter explores the nature of changes in pathological narcissism, focusing specifically on changes instigated not through therapeutic interventions but through life events that the individual has experienced as either corrective or corrosive. Such experiences can contribute to a modification or transformation of narcissism, with specific character traits and interpersonal and behavioral patterns ceasing to have pathological narcissistic functions (Ronningstam, Gundersen, &amp; Lyons, 1995). However, life events can also contribute to an increase in pathological narcissism and the development of trauma-associated narcissistic symptoms (Simon, 2000), severe NPD, or even a psychotic disorder with delusional grandiosity. The relationship between such external events and the work that takes place within the therapeutic alliance between patient and therapist or analyst may be complex and less obvious. The question is whether corrective life experiences that promote structural change and improved interpersonal relations actually may lessen the motivation for pursuing treatment. Such experiences can in themselves support a progressive and more satisfying involvement in life in ways that are experienced as less threatening to the self-esteem than involvement in intensive psychotherapy. On the other hand, an acute or gradual increase in pathological narcissism following a corrosive life event may actually motivate a person to seek treatment and work toward personal change.",

      "abstract": "Examination of neuropsychological functioning in schizophrenia indicates that against a background of diffuse impairment, some neurocognitive domains are differentially impaired. These include attention, memory and, to a lesser extent, abstraction and mental flexibility ('executive functions'). The deficits are present at the onset of illness and persist despite clinical improvement. The severity of initial deficits is weakly related to initial severity of symptoms, but a follow-up longitudinal evaluation suggests that the less patients improve in negative symptoms, the less they improve in neuropsychological performance. By contrast, improvement in some positive symptoms is associated with less improvement in some neuropsychological functions. The cognitive deficits are related to data from structural and functional imaging. Lower temporal lobe volume is associated with poorer cognitive abilities, and abnormally high left temporal lobe metabolism is also associated with poorer memory. The interplay between cognitive functioning, measures of brain structure and function, and clinical data is complex and seems to merit intensive and focused investigation. Such work can help elucidate pathophysiologic processes related to the phenomenology of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Focused Neuroregulation in the Treatment and Prevention of Mental and Physical Illness",
      "abstract": "Despite the enormous strides that have been made in neuroscience, the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. Consequently, various forms of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and neuromodulatory therapy continue to be applied without a clear understanding of what pathological process is being treated. However, an emerging hypothesis contends that psychiatric symptoms are the consequence of pathological hyperactivity in symptom-related circuits in the brain. According to the Multi-Circuit Neuronal Hyperexcitability (MCNH) Hypothesis of Psychiatric Disorders, persistent firing in anxiety circuits causes persistent feelings of anxiety; persistent firing in depressive circuits causes persistent feelings of depression; persistent firing in cognitive circuits causes ruminative and obsessive thoughts; etc… This pathological circuit-specific hyperactivity is believed to be caused by an inherent failure of the neurological system to self-regulate when perturbed by a psychological, emotional, or biological stressor. Based on this hypothesis, it would not be unreasonable to think that psychiatric symptoms, irrespective of which disorder was being treated, would respond favorably to any natural or medicinal intervention that reduces the excitability of the neurological system. Although the use of brain-calming drugs in psychiatry is not new, what is new is the idea of focusing their use on correcting a specific physiological abnormality that is believed to underlie the symptoms. This technique, which could be called “Focused Neuroregulation,” would differ from standard pharmacotherapy in that if one anticonvulsant failed to alleviate or only partially alleviated symptoms, another anticonvulsant would be substituted or added rather than turning to an off-target class of drugs. This approach is clinically valid because each anticonvulsant is structurally different, and there are multiple mechanisms (and receptors) through which the excitability of the neurological system can be therapeutically regulated. Also, anticonvulsants, unlike other classes of psychotropic drugs, tend to bring the system back into balance; hence the term “mood stabilizers.” Yet another benefit of Focused Neuroregulation is that it could help prevent or slow the progression of the many chronic health conditions that have been linked to an inherent hyperexcitability of the neurological system. In recognition of these potential benefits, and in an effort to avoid the many problems that are associated with the symptom-based treatment of psychiatric and related functional symptoms, the aim of this article is to incentivize the study of a more targeted approach to the treatment of mental illness and the prevention of chronic disease.",

      "abstract": "The clinical observations on alexithymia which were initiated by Sifneos and Nemiah in the earlier 1970s have given rise to a host of studies with implications beyond the psychosomatic field of enquiry. Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

Family physicians should consider referring patients when there are questions about diagnostic decision making or planning of individualized management strategies for patients with mild cognitive impairment, dementia, traumatic brain injury, and other clinical conditions that affect cognitive functioning. Neuropsychological testing can differentiate Alzheimer dementia from nondementia with nearly 90% accuracy. The addition of neuropsychological testing to injury severity variables (e.g., posttraumatic amnesia) increases predicted accuracy in functional outcomes. A neuropsychological evaluation can be helpful in addressing concerns about functional capacities (e.g., ability to drive or live independently) and in determining a patient's capacity to make decisions about health care or finances. Most patients who underwent neuropsychological evaluation and their significant others reported that they found the evaluation helpful in understanding and coping with cognitive problems.",

Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

      "title": "BENEFÍCIOS DA MELATONINA NA ENXAQUECA",
      "abstract": "A enxaqueca (migrânea) é uma doença neurológica crônica e incapacitante. Sua fisiopatologia é multifatorial, e as crises são deflagradas por fatores desencadeantes, que variam na sua intensidade e diversidade. Mecanismos como o genético, hormonal, ambiental e comportamental são destacados, sendo que as bases biológicas ocorrem através da intermediação de neurotransmissores. Atualmente, não existe tratamento padronizado para o completo alívio dos sintomas da enxaqueca, apenas terapia que promove uma melhora significativa na qualidade de vida dos pacientes. A melatonina, produzida a partir da glândula pineal é um hormônio que está envolvido no controle de ritmos circadianos e exerce uma série de efeitos farmacológicos. A melatonina medeia suas ações através dos receptores de melatonina MT1 / MT2. As síndromes de dor crônica são frequentemente associadas à desincronização de ritmos circadianos e biológicos, que também causam distúrbios no ciclo sono-vigília. Os efeitos analgésicos mediados pela melatonina parecem envolver β-endorfinas, receptores GABA, receptores opióides e a via óxido nítrico-arginina. A eficácia da melatonina como agente analgésico e ansiolítico foi demonstrado em vários modelos animais de dor. Estudos clínicos também estão evidenciando o efeito analgésico da melatonina, em diferentes condições patológicas, o que o torna uma alternativa promissora para o tratamento de dores refratárias, como a enxaqueca.",

Pain is the automatic danger signal that tells the individual to beware, for the normal mechanism is irritated in an abnormal manner, or even its integrity may be threatened.

      "title": "Doctor patient communication Content or process",
      "abstract": "In the doctor-patient interview, there is a tendency to think of a dichotomy between content or background (the patient's complaint, his symptoms, medical decision-making subject to evidence -evidence-based medicine (EBM)-, drug prescription, etc.) and the process or form of the interview (the modality of the doctor-patient relationship, empathy/assertiveness, sympathy, compassion, transference and countertransference, the placebo effect, etc.). This approach is as reductionist as the usual mind-body dualism. And the problem is that, as in the bio-psychosocial (BPS) approach, the holistic content-process approach to doctor-patient communication has not been integrated into the daily practice of general practitioners (GPs) with little time, who care for most patients with acute and chronic, physical and mental illnesses [1, 2]. General Medicine (GM) presents special characteristics that differentiate it from other medical specialties. In GM it is necessary to evaluate the presentation of symptoms, in addition to the symptoms themselves. That is, the reason for the consultation initiates or emphasizes important issues for the pat ient, and not just symptoms, in a communication context [3, 4]. GPs often assume that in consultation the patient will ment ion the most important symptoms and signs in relation to it, and that patients will spontaneously report all their fears and worries; neither of these assumptions is true (5). When a pat ient comes to the office, the GP must face a certain amount of uncertainty about the evaluation and optimal treatment of it. Uncertainty is frequently represented in terms of probability or normative reasoning, and EBM. But, the reason for consultation expressed by the patient is only a manifest content. The GP must transform or complete those ideas that are latent or initially hidden [6, 7]. Symptoms are often \"disorganized\", not readily recognizable, and can be presented by symbols, as does the arrangement of notes in a musical score. Perhaps the family doctor has to approach the symptoms as if they were \"music\": like a mysterious constellation; seeking order in disorder, or better trying to understand some of the disorder [8]. The symptom is an indicator of a process that is not always fully visible. The loss of internal balance manifests itself in the body in the form of a symptom. In addition, the symptom is not an enemy whose destruction should be the main objective, but can be an ally to find the disease. In reality, the symptom indicates what the patient “misses” (9). The GP try of knowing the latent material by means of “reading the patient’s manifest signs and symbols”. The messages of our patients contain “facts” and “feelings”, and we must be attent ive and understand the emotional messages. The reason for consultation / symptom / manifest problem that the patient initially expresses is a “symbolic representation” (with universal and particular symbols); and in addition, the doctor looks for what seems to be the cause of the patient's problem in the doctor-patient relationship itself [10]. The process of communication or presentation of the reason for the visit that the patient makes to the doctor is itself a content of the health problem, it gives information about the psychic life, and it can be a signal that tells the doctor which direction to take [11-13]. In order to fully understand the symptom we must distance ourselves from the usual valuations. It is convenient to replace an excessively analytical and rational thought, with another plastic, symbolic and analogical one. Illness is a system of interpretation; and to understand disease we have to see a system of relationships. The emotional response expressed by the patient has the effect of a linguistic transfer from social complexity to psychic complexity. Illness is expressed as a contrast –not as its own unequivocal entity, but as a contrast between relationship systems-, as in painting a contour, a line, appears from the contrast between two colours instead of how a line is actually drawn [14].",

Deficits of executive control have been described in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. We present a review of the findings with a focus on movement disorders, schizophrenia and affective disorders. We emphasize similarities between these disorders regarding the pathophysiology of fronto-subcortical networks. Based on these similarities, principles of pharmacological and rehabilitative strategies can be applied to the treatment of executive deficits in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders without being specific for one disease.

      "abstract": "A variety of personality, behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional changes typically follow traumatic brain injury. Standardized psychological tests are of limited value in assessing these individuals and may even be misleading. While neuropsychological testing is effective in discriminating the performance of brain damaged and non-brain damaged patients, the etiology of brain dysfunction must be inferred from the pattern of behavioral impairments and comparison to characteristic neurobehavioral patterns associated with specific types of neurological disorders. Strict reliance on test data can be misleading when testing patients with prominent orbital frontal lobe injury. The conditions of testing may also inadequately mask many of the patient's impairments and may lack sufficient \"ecological validity.\" Frequently psychologists fail to take a chronological history of the injury, the patient, or interview the family or significant others. Many reports focus on the patient's deficits and presumed site of injury rather than discuss the patient's strengths, coping strategies or compensatory behaviors.",

La presencia conduce a deterioro fisico y cognitivo del paciente, en relacion al componete cognitivo los factores mas reportadas son deficits en funciones ejecutivas, atencion, velocidad de procesamiento, habilidades visoespaciales y memoria, pocos estudios han reportado las alteraciones que presentan los pacientes con EM en aspectos del lenguaje, especificamente en el componente pragmatico, referido como la comprension de aspectos del significado de enunciados emitidos de los cuales no se puede obtener informacion de la intencion del hablante por una referencia directa o el lenguaje literal. En la literatura ha sugerido que las fallas en el componente pragmatico subyacen a la interaccion de otros dominios cognitivos. Existen 2 modelos que intentan explicar esta hipotesis identificando por un lado a las Funciones Ejecutivas (FE) y por otro a las Habilidades Visoespaciales (HV) en otras poblaciones como demencia tipo Alzheimer, siendo estas funciones tipicamente alteradas en EM. El objetivo del trabajo es examinar el rol de los componentes cognitivos involucrados en el deficit del funcionamiento pragmatico de pacientes con EM. Se realizara un estudio transversal correlacional, participaran 30 pacientes con EM remitente recurrente, se evaluara su desempeno en tareas de FE, HV y pragmatica utilizando la Bateria Neuropsicologica de Screening en Esclerosis Multiple y el Protocolo para la Evaluacion de la Comunicacion de Montreal. Los resultados de las dos evaluaciones se correlacionaran con el objetivo de identificar la relacion entre FE, HV y el componente de pragmatica para determinar si las alteraciones presentadas por los pacientes podrian estar permeadas por la funcion de otros dominios cognitivos.",

In contrast, the neurophysiological interaction between body and brain can be understood as fundamental for the genital and emotional experience of sexuality. Neuropsychological discoveries and clinical observations show that elevated muscle tension, superficial breathing and reduced body movement, as employed by many individuals during sexual arousal, will limit the perception of arousal and the degree of sexual pleasure. In contrast, deep breathing and variations in movement and muscle tension support it. Through the use of self awareness exercises and physical learning steps, patients can integrate their sexuality and increases its resistance to psychological, medical and relational interferences.",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью.

К факторам риска развития ЛИСБН относят пожилой возраст, курение, злоупотребление кофеином и алкоголем, заболевания желудочно-кишечного тракта, высокие дозы препаратов, одновременное применение двух препаратов и более. Механизм развития ЛИСБН связывается с действием лекарственных средств на различные рецепторы и нейромедиаторные системы, особенно дофаминергические.

Unawareness of the meaning of these symptoms often mislead both the patient and his physician.To define and describe the types of visual illusions and hallucinations which can be commonly encountered in neuro-ophthalmological practice.Overview article.Hallucinations are a perception not based on sensory input, whereas illusions are a misinterpretation of a correct sensory input. Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms. Then, careful visual function examination should provide a good insight in the location of the lesion.",

Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to effectively adapt to changes in the environment and/or changing task demands by selectively altering one’s thoughts, responses and/or behaviors. It can be assessed using several different neurocognitive tasks, including those that measure set-shifting and task-switching. This chapter will summarize the state of the science of cognitive flexibility deficits in individuals with eating disorders. Cognitive flexibility deficits in neuropsychological tasks appear to be most pronounced among individuals with anorexia nervosa and may be less characteristic of other eating disorders. Implications for a discrepancy in findings between objective and subjective measures of cognitive flexibility are also provided, as well implications for therapeutic interventions.",

A patient reacts to his disease, to his treatment, and to his physician with manifest psychological, cultural, and—for want of a better term—physiological regression. Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4. By means of iatrogenically induced regression it is possible to bring about new affects or mood states. 5. The bodily functions which are psycho-physiologically excited or inhibited by the regression or the defenses against it either increase or oppose the pathophysiology of the disease.",

Predisposing factors are a history of sexual or physical abuse, psychiatric disorders, previous episodes of functional coma, and recent surgery with general anesthesia. Several clinical signs are suggestive for the diagnosis, however none of them is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Therefore, functional coma remains an exclusion diagnosis. Vital signs must be normal, just as a routine blood examination, an electroencephalogram and imaging of the central nervous system. The most important differential diagnosis are catatonia, factitious disorder, and malingering. Spontaneous recovery can be expected after a duration of about 45 minutes to 4 days.",

      "abstract": "textabstractBipolar disorder (also called manic-depressive illness) is one of the major mood disorders. The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is an illness characterized by inherent mood instability that produces a predisposition to depressive, hypomanic, or manic episodes. This predisposition to affective episodes, rather than the episodes themselves (which can have many causes), is arguably the hallmark of bipolar disorder. Most episodes of bipolar disorder, including the first episode, are depressive. This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Treatment of a depressive episode in undiagnosed bipolar disorder can entail the use of medications that were developed to treat a different disorder (major depressive illness) and that may have mood-destabilizing or activating properties.",

Depression and sexual dysfunction have long been known as comorbid conditions; however, some research suggests that depressed mood may not always be associated with specific sexual dysfunctions. Associations between sexual dysfunction and depression appears bidirectional, such that either one of these conditions may trigger or worsen the other, while improvement in one may also improve the other. This chapter examines the complex relationship between depression and male and female sexual dysfunctions. We explore the classification and prevalence of sexual dysfunction, the known interconnections involving neurobiology, and psychological issues. Finally, we summarize the core principles of evaluation and treatment of common sexual dysfunctions, particularly in the context of depressive illness.",

The terms used to describe such symptoms—medically unexplained symptoms or functional somatic symptoms—are purely descriptive and do not imply psychogenesis. Other names such as somatisation and somatoform disorder are also being used but imply different definitions.1–3 Patients with medically unexplained symptoms do not fit into the existing framework of a biomedical model that tends to focus on the exclusion of physical disease. However, the exclusion of relevant physical disease may not in itself cure the patient. He or she may still feel ill and seek medical care. Medically unexplained symptoms therefore represent a clinical problem that must be taken seriously.1–4 General practice has a key role in the management of this clinical problem as at least 20-30% of primary care patients have medically unexplained symptoms.

Evaluating treatment outcome requires: (1) quantification of both pain intensity and pain-related impairment; and (2) review of how the relationship between these variables changes as a function of treatment. Simply tracking pain intensity level as an indicator of pain relief is insufficient and can lead to misinterpretation of the effects of an intervention.",

Yet toxic factors, intoxications, undoubtedly cause acute or subacute nervous disorders, which always exhibit definite histopathologic features but only occasionally possess a suggestive clinical picture. For this reason many disorders of the central nervous system remain undiagnosed and consequently improperly treated.

There is still a debate as to whether psychotic-like experiences in the community are on a continuum with psychotic symptoms in those meeting diagnostic criteria for psychosis diagnostic constructs. Schizophrenia may exist on a continuum with related conditions (e.g. schizotypal personality disorder). There are differences between people meeting criteria for schizophrenia and healthy controls but none that can be used as a diagnostic test to separate the two, with the possible exception of anomalous self-experiences differentiating schizophrenia spectrum conditions from healthy controls and other diagnostic constructs. Several general medical conditions also exist on a continuum with health with no zones of rarity (e.g. hypertension and type 2 diabetes). Thresholds to meet criteria for these diagnostic constructs are chosen by expert committees often based on risk of developing complications (e.g. myocardial infarctions) and/or whether medical intervention may be beneficial. Even reasonably objective investigations can give abnormal results in healthy people. Concerns about whether thresholds are too low, leading to over-diagnosis, unnecessary treatment, and iatrogenic harm, also exist in general medicine. Other classifications in mental health will need to use thresholds in order to fulfil functions such as administration, research, or access to services. Dimensional classifications are good at representing the many spectrums of mental health.",

As per the nosology of the DSM‐5 , the discrete behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern observed in FNSD‐CD is assumed to be a function of a problem of, or a disorder within, the individual. Accordingly, the psychiatric approach to FNSD‐CD, as set out in the DSM‐5 , invokes an assumption common to the medical model which is that of lineal (i.e., straight‐line) causality, namely, causal events are arranged in a lineal sequence. The interactional approach, however, which is a development of general system theory in the field of family therapy, offers an alternative approach to understanding psychiatric disorders. Specifically, this approach places the emphasis on the relationships between individuals and their reciprocal influences on – including their psychological and emotional wellbeing with – one another. It draws on the assumption of nonlineal (i.e., circular) causality, namely, causal events are arranged in a circular sequence. From an interactional approach, therefore, FNSD‐CD is thought to be a function of a problem of, or a deficit within, the individuals’ relationship/s, rather than within an individual, per se. This article utilises a composite case study to investigate FNSD‐CD from an interactional approach.",

      "title": "Neurodevelopmental and psychosocial aspects of Turner syndrome",
      "abstract": "Turner syndrome (TS) is the complex phenotype of human females with complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome, or monosomy X. A characteristic neurocognitive and psychosocial profile has also been described in TS females. Typically, specific deficits in visual-spatial/perceptual abilities, nonverbal memory function, motor function, executive function, and attentional abilities occur in TS children and adults of varying races and socioeconomic status. TS-associated psychosocial difficulties occur in the areas of maturity and social skills. We hypothesize that a subset of the neurocognitive deficits (visual-spatial/perceptual abilities) are genetically determined and result from abnormal expression of one or more X chromosome genes. In addition, a different subset of these neurocognitive deficits (memory, reaction time, and speeded motor function) result from estrogen deficiency and are at least somewhat reversible with estrogen treatment. The TS-associated psychosocial problems are most likely linked to these core neurocognitive deficits and do not reflect a separate and independent component of the syndrome. Turner syndrome research has progressed significantly over the last decade. The field has moved from descriptive reports based on single individuals or small clinical samples to the use of experimental designs with larger, more diverse and representative samples. This degree of variability among individuals with Turner syndrome in all domains (karyotype or genetic constitution, physical attributes, neurocognitive and social functioning) suggests the need to identify risk and protective factors contributing to the heterogeneity in the phenotype. Active education about TS and participation in patient advocacy groups such as the Turner Syndrome Society of the United States (http://www. turner-syndrome-us.org/) has provided new information for TS adults and families as well as a supportive peer group.

ED visits and hospital admissions for older adults with weakness and functional decline are common and present diagnostic challenges. Generalized weakness and functional decline are often associated with other geriatric syndromes such as delirium, falls, frailty, sarcopenia, and failure to thrive. The symptoms may be due to general aging progression, frailty, functional decline, sarcopenia, malnutrition, depression, loneliness, loss of social or caregiver support, financial difficulties, or a combination of these factors. Hospital case managers may help physicians decide whether a patient meets observation or inpatient admission criteria. Differential diagnoses include infection, metabolic derangements, and exacerbations of chronic conditions. Failure-to-address causes and consequences of functional decline may lead to further injury, illness, and decline.",

      "title": "Staging in bipolar disorder: from theoretical framework to clinical utility",
      "abstract": "Illness staging is widely utilized in several medical disciplines to help predict course or prognosis, and optimize treatment. Staging models in psychiatry in general, and bipolar disorder in particular, depend on the premise that psychopathology moves along a predictable path: an at-risk or latency stage, a prodrome progressing to a first clinical threshold episode, and one or more recurrences with the potential to revert or progress to late or end-stage manifestations. The utility and validity of a staging model for bipolar disorder depend on its linking to clinical outcome, treatment response and neurobiological measures. These include progressive biochemical, neuroimaging and cognitive changes, and potentially stage-specific differences in response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Mechanistically, staging models imply the presence of an active disease process that, if not remediated, can lead to neuroprogression, a more malignant disease course and functional deterioration. Biological elements thought to be operative in bipolar disorder include a genetic diathesis, physical and psychic trauma, epigenetic changes, altered neurogenesis and apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Many available agents, such as lithium, have effects on these targets. Staging models also suggest the utility of stage-specific treatment approaches that may not only target symptom reduction, but also impede illness neuroprogression. These treatment approaches range from prevention for at-risk individuals, to early intervention strategies for prodromal and newly diagnosed individuals, complex combination therapy for rapidly recurrent illness, and palliative-type approaches for those at chronic, late stages of illness. There is hope that prompt initiation of potentially disease modifying therapies may preclude or attenuate the cognitive and structural changes seen in the later stages of bipolar disorder. The aims of this paper are to: a) explore the current level of evidence supporting the descriptive staging of the syndromal pattern of bipolar disorder; b) describe preliminary attempts at validation; c) make recommendations for the direction of further studies; and d) provide a distillation of the potential clinical implications of staging in bipolar disorder within a broader transdiagnostic framework.",

      "abstract": "Τα ελλείμματα στην κοινωνική επικοινωνία αποτελούν τον πυρήνα των κλινικών συμπτωμάτων πολλών νευροψυχιατρικών διαταραχών όπως η σχιζοφρένεια, οι διαταραχές του φάσματος του αυτισμού και η κατάθλιψη. Επίσης, τα αυξημένα επίπεδα άγχους αποτελούν μία κοινή συννοσηρότητα σε πολλές διαταραχές, ελαττώνοντας την ποιότητα της ζωής των ατόμων αυτών. Η έντονη συνέκφραση κοινωνικών ελλειμάτων και άγχους υποδηλώνει ότι οι δύο αυτές παθολογίες μοιράζονται κοινούς νευροβιολογικούς μηχανισμούς και εγκεφαλικά νευρικά δίκτυα, τα οποία όμως παραμένουν σε μεγάλο βαθμό ασαφή. Η ανισορροπία μεταξύ Διέγερσης/Αναστολής, σε διάφορες φλοιϊκές και υπο-φλοιϊκές περιοχές του Δικτύου Λήψης Κοινωνικών Αποφάσεων καθώς και τα αυξημένα επίπεδα νευροφλεγμονής έχουν προταθεί ως κοινοί αιτιολογικοί μηχανισμοί που εμπλέκονται στην εκδήλωση και των δύο παθολογιών. Επίσης, η συμβολή άλλων συστημάτων νευροδιαβίβασης, όπως του νοραδρενεργικού και του ενδοκανναβινοειδούς συστήματος, καθώς και ο ρόλος της ενήλικης νευρογένεσης παραμένουν σε μεγάλο βαθμό ασαφή. Παλαιότερες μελέτες του εργαστηρίου μας έχουν καταδείξει τα υψηλά επίπεδα έκφρασης αδρενεργικών υποδοχέων καθώς και την ύπαρξη σημαντικού ρυθμού νευρογένεσης, εντός του SDMN ζεβροϊχθύων, προτείνοντας την πιθανή συμβολή τους στη συν-εκδήλωση των δύο αυτών παθολογιών.Τα αποτελέσματα της παρούσας διδακτορικής διατριβής υποστηρίζουν ότι η ανισορροπία μεταξύ γλουταμινεργικής και GABAεργικής νευροδιαβίβασης καθώς και η δυσλειτουργία της ενδοκανναβινοειδούς σηματοδότησης που παρατηρείται στον εγκέφαλο ζεβροϊχθύων, οι οποίοι χαρακτηρίζονται από υπολειτουργία των NMDA υποδοχέων, διαδραματίζουν σημαντικό ρόλο κατά την εκδήλωση των κοινωνικών ελλειμάτων και των αυξημένων επιπέδων άγχους. Επίσης, τα αυξημένα επίπεδα έκφρασης της προ-φλεγμονώδους κυτοκίνης IL-1β, σε νευρικά η αστρογλοιακά κύτταρα εντός συγκεκριμένων κόμβων του SDMN, αναδεικνύουν τον κρίσιμο ρόλο των νευρο-φλεγμονωδών αποκρίσεων κατά την συν-εκδήλωση των παραπάνω διαταραχών. Πιο συγκεκριμένα, βάσει των αποτελεσμάτων μας προτείνουμε ότι μεταβολές στην γλουταμινεργική νευροδιαβίβαση εμπλέκονται στην εκδήλωση των κοινωνικών ελλειμάτων ενώ η GABAεργική και ενδοκανναβινοειδής δυσλειτουργία συσχετίζεται θετικά με την αγχώδη συμπεριφορά. Αντιθέτως, τα αυξημένα επίπεδα έκφρασης της IL-1β συνδέονται και με τις δύο συμπεριφορικές καταστάσεις.Όσο αφορά την κατεχολαμινεργική νευροδιαβίβαση, τα αποτελέσματά μας καταδεικνύουν την ύπαρξη αυξημένων επιπέδων έκφρασης του μεταφορέα της ντοπαμίνης και των β2-αδρενενεργικών υποδοχέων (β2-ARs) στον τελεγκέφαλο ζεβροϊχθύων που χαρακτηρίζονται από συμπεριφορά κοινωνικής αποφυγής και αυξημένα επίπεδα άγχους. Μάλιστα, είναι ενδιαφέρον ότι η έκφραση των β2-ARs ρυθμίζεται διαφορετικά εντός διαφορετικών περιοχών του SDMN, παρουσιάζοντας αυξημένα επίπεδα στον κοιλιακό πυρήνα του κοιλιακού τελεγκεφάλου (Vv) και μειωμένη έκφραση στον έσω πυρήνα του ραχιαίου τελεγκεφάλου (Dm) καθώς και στον πρόσθιο φυματικό πυρήνα (ATN). Επιπλέον, ο εντοπισμός των β2-ARs σε GABAεργικά και/ή mGluR5+ κύτταρα, υποστηρίζει τον πιθανό ρυθμιστικό ρόλο των β2-ARs κατά την συνέκφραση των ελλειμάτων στην κοινωνική συμπεριφορά και των αυξημένων επιπέδων άγχους, ρυθμίζοντας την ισορροπία μεταξύ διέγερσης/αναστολής. Tέλος, προτείνουμε ότι μεταβολές της δομικής πλαστικότητας και ειδικότερα της ενήλικης νευρογένεσης, σε περιοχές του ραχιαίου και κοιλιακού τελεγκεφάλου, όπως προκύπτει από τις μεταβολές του προτύπου του κυτταρικού πολλαπλασιασμού και επιβίωσης των νευρικών βλαστικών κυττάρων, χαρακτηρίζει την συμπεριφορά κοινωνικής αποφυγής και τα αυξημένα επίπεδα άγχους των ζεβροϊχθύων. Συνοψίζοντας, τα ευρήματα της παρούσας διατριβής προτείνουν ότι η υπολειτουργία των NMDA υποδοχέων και η επακόλουθη πρόκληση ανισορροπίας μεταξύ Διέγερσης/Αναστολής, εντός περιοχών του SDMN, σχετίζεται με τα σοβαρά ελλείμματα στην κοινωνική συμπεριφορά και τα αυξημένα επίπεδα άγχους που εμφανίζουν οι ζεβροϊχθύες. Επιπρόσθετα, οι μεταβολές στην κατεχολαμινεργική και ενδοκανναβινοειδή σηματοδότηση, τα αυξημένα επίπεδα νευροφλεγμονής και οι μεταβολές του προτύπου της ενήλικης νευρογένεσης, πιθανόν συνεισφέρουν στη συννοσηρότητα των παραπάνω παθολογιών. Τα αποτελέσματά μας επομένως αναδεικνύουν την ύπαρξη επιπρόσθετων νευροβιολογικών μηχανισμών και περιοχών που εμπλέκονται στην εκδήλωση των κοινωνικών ελλειμμάτων και των αυξημένων επιπέδων άγχους, έπειτα από υπολειτουργία των NMDA υποδοχέων, παρέχοντας νέους πιθανούς στόχους για την ανάπτυξη πιο αποτελεσματικών και στοχευμένων θεραπευτικών προσεγγίσεων με στόχο την υποχώρηση των παραπάνω συμπτωμάτων.",

These are not due to sensory deficits or teaching failures, but rather are the result of specific neurobiological abnormalities. In the case of dyslexia, for instance, neuroimaging research has found atypical activation in critical regions of the left hemisphere, such as the fusiform gyrus or the temporoparietal region, involved in decoding and phonological abilities, and reduced functional connectivity among these and other (in)directly relevant language production areas. On another hand, dyscalculia, involves changes in the intraparietal sulcus and the thalamus with effects on the processing of numbers and working memory. The neuropsychological evaluation is the touchstone of diagnosis for these learning disorders and for the planning of more individualized remediation. A variety of neuroscience-informed treatments (e.g., hemispheric stimulation, cognitive training, transcranial electrical stimulation, and educational computer games) have been successful in increasing reading and executive functions. Further research is, however, still required to gain an improved understanding of these conditions and an ethical obligation among professionals to follow the developments in this emerging field of learning disorder neuroscience.",

Die ganze Körpermuskulator oder auch nur einzelne Muskelgruppen können betroffen sein. Ein besonders bekanntes Beispiel ist der sog. Schiefhals (Tortikollis). Andere Sonderformen sind Blephrospasmus (unwillkürliches Lidzusammenkneifen), der vorwiegend im höheren Lebensalter auftritt, kraniale Dystonie (Grimassieren), spasmodische Dysphonie (gepreßtes heiseres Sprechen) und der sog. Schreibkrampf. Die Bewegungsstörung kann so bizarre Ausmaße annehmen, daß die Umwelt oder auch die behandelnden ärzte sie mit seelisch bedingten Bewegungsstörungen verwechseln können. Dies hängt auch damit zusammen, daß unter Aufregung oder Streß in beiden Fällen das Ausmaß der Bewegungsstörung zunehmen kann.",

Own results regarding the incidence of various neurological and psychiatric symptoms are described. Evaluation of these symptoms in a longitudinal study allows to differentiate between an acute and a subacute form of this disease state. The prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms are characterized by a disintegration of complex neuronal functions. A rating scale comprising four different symptoms is proposed, allowing grading of the disease state. Such a scale cannot replace a careful neurological work up; such work ups have to be done in regular intervals in these patients, so that neurological symptoms can be recognized at an early state.",

Therefore, unconsciousness has the opposite meaning, that is, a state of unawareness of self and environment or a suspension of those mental activities by which people are made aware of themselves and their environment, coupled with a diminished responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness can have many different causes, for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury, anesthesia, brainstem lesions and sleep, the various causes of unconsciousness primarily interfering with different brain functions. Clinically, impaired consciousness such as coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a very common manifestation in subjects with acquired brain injury. Unconsciousness does not always consist of a general suppression of the entire activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the actual cause(s), many functions, such as protective reflexes and various cognitive processes, can remain intact. The Management of such a patient in VS or MCS requires carefully reaching the correct diagnosis, pronouncing an evidence-based prognosis, and thoughtfully considering the medical, ethical, and legal elements of optimum treatment (Bernat, 2006).",

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

      "title": "Estudio comparativo de la acción psicofarmacológica y analgésica de extractos de plantas de uso terapéutico tradicional con antidepresivos inhibidores selectivos de la recaptación de monoaminas",
      "abstract": "El dolor es una manifestacion clinica frecuente cuyo tratamiento esta lejos de ser optimo, aunque en los ultimos anos se han producidos avances muy significativos. A esto hay que sumar el hecho de que el dolor suele acompanarse de otras enfermedades comorbidas entre las que destacan la depresion, la ansiedad, el deterioro cognitivo y las alteraciones del sueno. Los antidepresivos son farmacos frecuentemente utilizados en el tratamiento del dolor, bien solos o en combinacion con otros analgesicos. Su utilizacion se debe principalmente a dos motivos: por su accion analgesica en algunos cuadros clinicos de dolor neuropatico, y por sus propiedades antidepresivas, logicamente, e incluso ansioliticas en algunos casos. Hasta el momento, no se conoce con exactitud el mecanismo de accion por el cual los antidepresivos producen su efecto analgesico, ni tampoco las diferencias entre ellos en el contexto del dolor. Centrandonos en las investigaciones preclinicas, es necesario de cara a un futuro desarrollo de nuevos farmacos antidepresivos analgesicos, conocer la sensibilidad de los diferentes modelos de dolor a los mecanismos especificos de accion antidepresiva. Los antidepresivos con alguna excepcion suelen ejercer su accion farmacologica inhibiendo la recaptacion de monoaminas, concretamente serotonina y noradrenalina, y este mismo mecanismo parece ser el que les concede actividad analgesica. Asimismo, este mecanismo les hace poseer accion ansiolitica. Es necesario por tanto en psicofarmacologia preclinica, discernir sobre la capacidad de los diferentes antidepresivos para inducir efecto antidepresivo, analgesico y ansiolitico en diferentes metodos que puedan servir para orientar la investigacion futura en este campo. Tambien es necesario conocer su capacidad de producir efectos sobre la cognicion ya que su uso cronico puede derivar en un deterioro cognitivo . Un aspecto de gran importancia y que ha constituido uno de los objetivos de esta tesis es saber el rango de potencia en relacion con la dosificacion de los antidepresivos y su mecanismo de accion como agentes capaces de inducir efecto analgesico y ansiolitico. Es decir, es importante conocer si las dosis a las que se evidencia un efecto analgesico son las mismas a las que se observa un efecto ansiolitico y tambien relacionar este orden de potencia con los efectos cognitivos. Como quiera que el mecanismo de accion de los antidepresivos esta relacionado con la inhibicion de la recaptacion de serotonina y noradrenalina y que los rangos de potencia para inducir este efecto son diferente entre ellos, es de importancia saber que modelos son mas sensibles a un mecanismo u otro. Es decir, es de interes conocer que modelos son mas especificos para detectar un efecto serotoninergico o noradrenergico o los dos, en relacion con el efecto antidepresivo, ansiolitico, analgesico y cognitivo. Tambien es importante, puesto que la mayor parte de los modelos son interferidos por la posible capacidad que tienen los antidepresivos de producir cambios en la motricidad, conocer si los efectos que observamos estan o no relacionados con estos cambios motores, con el fin de no inducirnos a error en futuras investigaciones.",

      "abstract": "A substantial proportion of patients in general practice consult for subjective symptoms, such as pain or fatigue, without corresponding objective findings.1–4 Some of these patients present trivial symptoms that do not indicate disease; others recover after long-lasting symptoms and disability. Here, we shall refer to conditions with long-lasting and disabling symptoms, not trivial or passing symptoms. Such conditions are called medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Syndromes with specific diagnostic criteria, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome, are often included among MUS conditions.2\n\nAlthough management of patients with MUS presents several challenges, GPs accept the responsibility for investigation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.5\n\nBiopsychosocial approaches are commonly applied in medical practice, whether the aim is full recovery or coping with symptoms and disability,1 and psychologically based interventions (especially different cognitive behavioural therapies [CBT]) have been developed for coping and symptom relief. Yet, such approaches do not substantiate MUS as a mental disorder. Lamahewa et al found, for example, that comorbidity with depression and generalised anxiety disorder occurred in only one-third of these patients.2 Studies have evaluated effects of CBT on different outcome measures, such as pain, function, work ability, or healthcare use, often presenting limited or no significant effects based on weak evidence.4\n\nMUS is not a clinical diagnosis but an analytical concept, unifying a diverse group of health problems where no joint cause or biomarker have been identified. Together MUS conditions dispute the idea that objective findings are needed to confirm subjective symptoms as disease. The biomedical disease model has imposed an unfortunate body–mind duality, with illness categorised as psychological when no objective findings are identified.2,4 Conceptualising MUS …",

Up to 60% of these patients is also suffering from psychosocial problems. Therefore it is important to define the patient's complaints in terms of a biopsychosocial disorder, to acknowledge the relevance of the psychosocial aspects and to provide an integrated psychosomatic treatment or a psychotherapy if indicated. Most of the research on psychotherapy in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome and different methods of treatments were studied (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and relaxation). Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. Hypnotherapy is successful not only for irritable bowel syndrome but also for functional dyspepsia. Predictors of a positive response to psychological treatment generally are: (1) awareness that stress exacerbates their bowel symptoms, (2) at least mild anxiety or depression, (3) the predominant bowel symptom is abdominal pain or diarrhea and not constipation, (4) the abdominal pain waxes and wanes in response to eating, defecation, or stress rather than being constant pain, and 5) the symptoms are of relatively short duration. Benefits persist over years, and in the long run, clinic visits and health care costs can be reduced.",

      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscles and substances released during physical activity (myokines) have a beneficial influence on the functioning of the organism. Myokines (released also by myocardium) together with hepatokines and adipokines play an important role not only in energetic metabolism, but they also influence, among others, the function of the circulatory and nervous systems, modulation of inflammatory state and atherogenesis. Under pathological conditions connected with the presence of chronic diseases, chronic inflammatory state, low physical activity, long-term immobility the following consequences are observed: reduction of muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia) and changed profile of released myokines. The incidence of sarcopenia is connected with an unfavorable course of the aging process, often leading to disability and multiple morbidities. Sarcopenia can also lead to frailty syndrome, which not only worsens the prognosis of various diseases, but it can also increase the risk of medical procedures. Sarcopenia and adverse przymyokine profile are modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and affecting them may improve functional status and prognosis. An important intervention to improve muscles function and myokine profile, apart from nutritional treatment and pharmacotherapy, is regular physical activity as a component of cardiac rehabilitation. In our paper we focused on a review of the newest research regarding the association of sarcopenia and the profile of released myokines with incidence and course of cardiovascular diseases such as chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, carotid artery atherosclerosis or ischemic cerebral stroke.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Successful training must involve overload, but also must avoid the combination of excessive overload plus inadequate recovery. Athletes can experience short‐term performance decrement, without severe psychological, or lasting other negative symptoms. This Functional Overreaching (FOR) will eventually lead to an improvement in performance after recovery. When athletes do not sufficiently respect the balance between training and recovery, Non‐Functional Overreaching (NFOR) can occur. The distinction between NFOR and the Overtraining Syndrome (OTS) is very difficult and will depend on the clinical outcome and exclusion diagnosis. The athlete will often show the same clinical, hormonal and other signs and symptoms. A keyword in the recognition of OTS might be ‘prolonged maladaptation’ not only of the athlete, but also of several biological, neurochemical, and hormonal regulation mechanisms. It is generally thought that symptoms of OTS, such as fatigue, performance decline and mood disturbances, are more severe than those of NFOR. However, there is no scientific evidence to either confirmor refute this suggestion. One approach to understanding the aetiology of OTS involves the exclusion of organic diseases or infections and factors such as dietary caloric restriction (negative energy balance) and insufficient carbohydrate and/or protein intake, iron deficiency, magnesium deficiency, allergies, etc., together with identification of initiating events or triggers. In this paper, we provide the recent status of possible markers for the detection of OTS. Currently several markers (hormones, performance tests, psychological tests, biochemical and immune markers) are used, but none of them meets all criteria to make its use generally accepted.",

This chapter reviews the literature evaluating different non-pharmacological approaches to treating these symptoms. Meta-analytic studies suggest that social skills training, music therapy, non-invasive brain stimulation, mindfulness, and exercise-based interventions are all effective at improving negative symptoms, relative to treatment as usual (TAU). Effect sizes for these interventions range from small to moderate. The long-term benefits of these interventions are currently unclear, and there has been some debate as to whether the impact of these interventions constitute consistent, clinically meaningful change. Evidence for other therapies such as arts therapies other than music therapy, cognitive behavioural therapies for psychosis, neurocognitive therapies, and family-based interventions is more inconsistent. As a result, primary negative symptoms of schizophrenia can still be considered an important unmet therapeutic need where more research is needed.",

Here, the authors attempt a functional anatomical classification of all disorders linked to visual perception, whatever the clinical context in which they arise, including those disorders that bridge vision, emotion, memory, language and action. Guided by clinical and neuroimaging evidence, visual perceptual disorders are classified by the functional anatomical networks likely to be involved and the class of underlying dysfunction, whether topological (a localised deficit or region of hyperfunction) or hodological (a disconnection or hyperconnection). The wider perspective forces us to consider what visual functions underlie a range of symptoms sidelined by previous classificatory schemes and helps generate novel hypotheses for further research in the area.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating multi-systemic chronic illness of unknown etiology, classified as a neurological disorder by the World Health Organization (WHO). The symptomatology of the condition appears to emanate from a variety of sources of chronic neurological disturbance and associated distortions, and chronicity, in noxious sensory signaling and neuroimmune activation. This article incorporates a summary review and discussion of biomedical research considered relevant to this essential conception perspective. It is intended to provide stakeholders with a concise, integrated outline disease model in order to help demystify this major public health problem. The primary etiopathological factors presented are: (A) Postural/biomechanical pain signaling, affecting adverse neuroexcitation, in the context of compression, constriction, strain, or damage of vertebral-regional bone and neuromuscular tissues; (B) Immune mediated inflammatory sequelae, in the context of prolonged immunotropic neurotrophic infection-with lymphotropic/gliotropic/glio-toxic varieties implicated in particular; (C) A combination of factors A and B. Sustained glial activation under such conditions is associated with oxidative and nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and neural sensitivity. These processes collectively enhance the potential for multi-systemic disarray involving endocrine pathway aberration, immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegeneration, and tend toward still more intractable synergistic neuro-glial dysfunction (gliopathy), autoimmunity, and central neuronal sensitization.",

But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur.

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

      "abstract": "What is the topic of this review? It provides an overview of the recent papers linking brain neurotransmission with exercise-induced and/or mental fatigue. What advances does it highlight? The noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue during prolonged exercise, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. 2) Mental fatigue affects several neurotransmitter systems, with presumably an important role for dopamine and adenosine, in multiple brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex.In sports and exercise science, fatigue is an elusive concept that has important implications in performance during exercise. It has been described in many ways (tiredness, exhaustion, lethargy or weariness) and describes a physical and/or mental state of being tired and lack of energy. Exercise-induced fatigue can be defined as an acute impairment of exercise performance, and a distinction has been made between peripheral and central fatigue. Mental fatigue can be defined as a psychobiological state caused by prolonged exertion that has the potential to reduce cognitive performance and exercise performance. Recent studies have given clear indications that brain catecholamines are involved in the onset of fatigue during endurance exercise. Evidence is provided indicating that the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system hastens central fatigue, a finding that coincides with a faster rate of increase in the rating of perceived exertion. Brain neurotransmission is also suggested to play an important role in mental fatigue. Several neurotransmitter systems might be implicated (with the most important role for dopamine and adenosine) in multiple brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and the summation of these alterations might explain the impairment in endurance performance in a mentally fatigued state. Obviously, we have to keep in mind that fatigue is a very complex construct and that, besides brain neurochemistry, several other factors play a role in its onset.",

Zaburzenia psychiczne, choć nie zawsze widoczne podczas pierwszego kontaktu z pacjentem, mogą obniżać jego jakość życia w stopniu równie istotnym, co niepełnosprawność ruchowa. Co więcej, często bezpośrednio wpływają na motywację chorego i wyniki rehabilitacji ruchowej. Choroby niedokrwienne mózgu, takie jak udar niedokrwienny czy choroby małych naczyń, powodują wiele objawów zaburzających dobrostan psychofizyczny pacjenta w zakresie funkcji ruchowych, czuciowych i emocjonalno-poznawczych. W praktyce pielęgniarskiej ważna jest znajomość cech charakterystycznych zaburzeń neuropsychologicznych i sposobów ich rehabilitacji, ponieważ każdy rodzaj oddziaływań może mieć terapeutyczny wpływ na pacjenta. W pracy dokonano przeglądu oddziaływań terapeutycznych mających na celu usprawnianie funkcji poznawczych zaburzonych wskutek chorób niedokrwiennych mózgu. Obok tradycyjnych metod opisano nowe, rzadko jeszcze stosowane formy usprawniania będące uzupełnieniem standardowo prowadzonych terapii. Są to programy komputerowe oraz ćwiczenia wspomagane sprzężeniem zwrotnym. Nowością w terapii poudarowej jest neurofeedback. Dzięki treningom dochodzi do zmian w funkcjonowaniu poznawczym, także na poziomie funkcji i struktury mózgu. Zmiany te są widoczne zarówno u pacjentów trenowanych metodami tradycyjnymi, jak i z wykorzystaniem programów komputerowych. Sugeruje to ważną rolę procesów neuroplastyczności mózgu w poprawie funkcjonowania poznawczego po treningach.",

      "abstract": "L'attribution a des lesions cerebrales de troubles specifiques de la motivation constitue une contribution recente de la neurologie clinique, principalement francophone, au domaine des neurosciences et a la connaissance du substrat cerebral des fonctions mentales. A la suite des premieres observations de troubles de l'action et de l'affect (apathie, apragmatisme, indifference affective, perte d'interet), consecutives a la destruction, selective mais bilaterale, des noyaux pallidaux, est nee la notion de syndrome athymhormique, concu comme un trouble specifique de la capacite des sujets a convertir leurs affects en action. Outre cette pathologie de la motivation proprement dite, les patients decrivent souvent, mais non toujours, une experience tres particuliere de vide mental, laissant presumer que les systemes en cause controlent egalement certains aspects de l'activite mentale spontanee. Toutefois, cette absence d'activite physique et mentale spontanee contraste avec la preservation des capacites motrices et intellectuelles, lorsu'elles sont stimulees exterieurement. Parallelement, ces constatations cliniques ont permis de devoiler un aspect insoupconne des fonctions des noyaux gris centraux, en montrant que, de la meme maniere que cela avait ete precedemment decrit chez l'animal, la motivation humaine est dependante de l'activite d'un circuit cortico-sous-cortical bilateral centre sur le couple striato-pallidal, plus specialement dans leurs portions anatomiquement connectees aux elements du systeme limbique. Ce circuit limbique' comprend ainsi la portion ventrale du striato-pallidum (noyau caude et pallidum interne), le thalamus dorso-median, le cortex frontal median. L'analyse des cas publies de syndrome athymhormique suggere qu'une lesion bilaterale de ce circuit, a n'importe quel point de son trajet cortico-sous-cortical, est necessaire et suffisante pour provoquer les elements du syndrome athymhormique. Outre son interet neurophysiologique et clinique, l'introduction de ce nouveau concept en neuropsychologie ouvre des perspectives interessantes pour la physiopathologie de certaines maladies psychiatriques.",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6.

      "abstract": "Longtemps ignorée, la douleur des personnes souffrant de pathologie mentale et troubles neuro-développementaux tels que les Troubles du Spectre de l’Autisme (TSA) est considérée comme l’une des plus difficiles à prendre en charge. La douleur non exprimée ne joue plus son rôle d’alerte à la menace vitale et contribue à l’augmentation de la mortalité liée à des pathologies somatiques dans ces populations dites vulnérables, notamment chez les adultes avec TSA [1,4], chez qui la prescription de psychotropes compliquent les mesures d’hétéro-évaluations classiques. Certaines études expérimentales ont montrés que ces groupes de patients présentent des particularités nociceptives avec des seuils à la nociception augmentés ou des réactions paradoxales, mais les résultats sont contradictoires [2]. Les causes de ces phénomènes sont mal comprises. Une atteinte des structures cérébrales impliquées dans l’intégration émotionnelle de la douleur (cortex préfrontal), une augmentation de l’activité opiacée, une dissociation paradoxale entre la réponse comportementale et les réactions neurovégétatives, des possibles anomalies des mécanismes excitateurs responsables de la sommation temporelle, ont contrebalancé les hypothèses plus psychopathologiques de troubles de l’expression de la douleur dans cette condition pathologiques développementales [1,3]. En effet, au-delà de l’atteinte des processus cognitifs, les troubles de la communication chez les personnes avec TSA sont à ce jour considérés comme la principale cible des interventions à mener dans les cadres psycho-éducatifs et thérapeutiques afin de mieux prévenir et dépister la douleur chez ces patients hautement vulnérables.

      "title": "Anesthetics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anesthesia, which constitutes a state in which noxious events such as surgical procedures are imperceptible, may or may not be accompanied by loss of consciousness. A complete or general anesthetic given by the inhalation or intravenous routes produces hypnosis (profound sleep), analgesia, muscle relaxation, and protection against the increase in blood pressure and heart rate resulting from surgical stress (maintains homeostasis). An anesthetic which blocks the neural transmission of painful stimuli through afferent nerves and does not affect the level of consciousness can be classified as a local anesthetic. Induction of general anesthesia produces a progressive deepening of the anesthetic state and represents a descending desensitization of the central nervous system (CNS). A progression of clinical signs useful for estimating the depth of anesthesia. Four stages can be defined: first, a state of altered consciousness and analgesia begin; second, loss of consciousness, accompanied by irregular respiration and motor movement from depression of higher motor inhibitory centers with release of lower motor mechanisms, occurs; third, surgical anesthesia is reached, in which spinal cord and spinal reflexes are abolished, providing relaxation of skeletal musculature, and loss of corneal, conjunctival, pharyngeal, and laryngeal reflexes occurs progressively; fourth, onset of respiratory paralysis resulting from significant depression of the medullary respiratory center occurs, and subsequent cardiovascular collapse ensues. Monitoring via an electroencephalogram (EEG) and hemodynamic and blood gas monitoring help assess the depth of anesthesia. The potency of inhaled agents is expressed as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) that is required to prevent spontaneous movement in response to a surgical or equivalent stimulus in 50% of patients. The onset of action is fast (within 60 s) for the intravenous anesthetic agents and somewhat slower for inhalation and local anesthetics. Although the modern practice of anesthesia is exceedingly sophisticated, identification of the basic molecular mechanism underlying it is still lacking. Inhalational anesthetics are very diverse chemically and extrapolation from the effect of a particular agent to the physiological state of anesthesia is problematic. Anesthesia theories may be divided into two categories: lipid theories and protein theories. Lipid theory postulates that inhalational anesthetics exert their primary effects by dissolving in the lipid portions of nerves, altering the conductivity. In protein theories, the direct interaction of inhalation anesthetics and proteins has been proposed as the cause of anesthesia. All inhalation anesthetics agents introduced after 1950, except ethyl vinyl ether, contain fluorine. Agents such as ether, chloroform, trichloroethylene (Trilene), cyclopropane, and fluoroxene (Fluoromar), which were once used, have been displaced by the newer fluorinated anesthetics. The intravenous (iv) anesthetic agents are of two types: those which are used to induce, but not maintain, anesthesia, and those useful for induction and also maintenance. The need is for an anesthetic agent having an extremely fast rate of onset and limited side effects. Fast onset minimizes the stress and agitation. Among the various classes of compounds that have been used are barbiturates, opioids, steroids, benzodiazepines, and hindered phenols. Balanced anesthesia, a potent opioid combined with an inhalation agent, is often used. The inhalational agents probably exert their biological activity through physical effects, while function through a biological receptor‐mediated pathway. At the end of a surgery, the primary concern is to eliminate respiratory depressant effects. This reversal can also diminish analgesic effects. There are two types of reversal agents: pure antagonists and mixed agonist–antagonists. The antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are the most commonly used. Local anesthetics act by inhibiting the channel opening allowing influx of sodium ions. The degree of blockage depends not only on the amount of drug, but also on the rate of nerve stimulation. In the clinically useful agents the polar group is an ester or an amide, although activity may be maintained when the polar function is an ether, thioether, ketone, or thioester. The ideal agent should have a short onset of nesthesia and be useful for multiple indications.",

KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG KUNNSKAPSGRUNNLAG En vurdering av eksisterende litteratur, inkludert litteratursøk, samt vår kliniske erfaring ligger til grunn for innholdet i artikkelen. RESULTATER RESULTATER I eksisterende undersøkelser er det brukt varierende definisjoner av tilstanden og det er anvendt ulike kartleggingsverktøy. Forekomsten av utmattelse etter hjerneslag eller traumatisk hjerneskade er usikker på grunn av ulike inklusjonskriterier og kartleggingsmetoder og fordi ulikt måletidspunkt kan gi ulike prevalenstall. I flere arbeider anslås forekomsten til å ligge mellom 50 % og 70 %. Vår kunnskap om de patologiske mekanismene er svært begrenset. Både premorbide, sosiodemografiske, slag-/traumerelaterte og komorbide faktorer spiller inn på hvordan pasienten oppfatter tilstanden. Blant anvendte behandlingstiltak er psykoedukasjon, aktivitetsregulering, fysisk trening og behandling av komorbide tilstander. Det er også gjort forsøk med medikamentell behandling, foreløpig uten overbevisende resultater. FORTOLKNING FORTOLKNING Utmattelse er vanlig hos hjerneslagpasienter og pasienter med traumatiske hjerneskader og begrenser ofte i betydelig grad deres hverdag.

      "title": "Neurobiology of Behavior: Anatomic and Physiological Implications Related to Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: Controversy exists concerning whether epileptic seizures can produce enduring alterations in neuronal function that cause interictal behavioral disturbances. Although arguments favoring the occurrence of epilepsy‐induced disorders of behavior must not be presented in a way that adds to the stigmata associated with epilepsy, it is not in the best interest of epileptic patients to deny this possible relationship and overlook an opportunity to prevent or treat a major cause of disability. There is evidence to suggest that psychosocial factors cannot account for all the behavioral problems suffered by patients with epilepsy. Behavioral disturbances ascribed to antiepileptic drugs and specific structural lesions may also be due, in part, to epileptogenic mechanisms. Some interictal behavioral disturbances may actually reflect unrecognized ictal events. Most importantly, data obtained from clinical research and animal investigations suggest testable hypotheses of how recurrent epileptic seizures can alter neuronal function in ways that would predispose to specific disruptive interictal behaviors, such as aggression, depression and schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Resumo : O AVE ou Acidente Vascular Encefalico e uma doenca que acomete as pessoas adultas e idosas e que causa disfuncao motora (sob forma de comprometimento no hemicorpo: hemiparesia que e uma fraqueza muscular ou hemiplegia que e a paralisia dos musculos do lado comprometido), disfuncao na comunicacao (sob forma de afasia), na cognicao (problemas na memoria) na incapacidade de realizacao de tarefas cotidianas e no desempenho funcional/ocupacional das pessoas acometidas pela patologia. Uma disfuncao invisivel e que passa despercebida para o paciente e, por vezes, para os profissionais que o acompanham, e a perda da sensibilidade. A referida perda tem consequencias no desempenho motor pois sem o feed-back sensorial torna-se dificil realizar movimentos delicados ou coordenados. E a disfuncao sensorial pode agravar os problemas de negligencia do lado afetado, uma vez que o paciente nao sente o lado acometido, “abandonando” o uso da mao comprometida. Uma das grandes dificuldades da familia e cuidadores e com relacao as disfuncoes apresentadas pelo paciente e como realizar as atividades para que o mesmo alcance independencia nas tarefas cotidianas. As orientacoes dadas pela Terapia Ocupacional no momento da alta hospitalar quanto as atividades da vida diaria, para recuperacao sensorial e adequacao das atividades em geral, sao bem recebidas pelos familiares. Um acompanhamento sistematico, com novas orientacoes e demonstracoes e de grande valia para reduzir as dificuldades para desempenho das atividades da vida diaria por parte dos pacientes e para minimizar as demandas junto aos cuidadores. Os beneficiarios diretos sao os familiares e mais especificamente os cuidadores dos pacientes que, em geral, sao as esposas/companheiras dos pacientes que ja tem tarefas de cuidados domesticos. Foram beneficiados aproximadamente 30 pessoas e a reducao das demandas por parte dos pacientes foi crucial para qualidade de vida.",

However, it actually has much in common with any area of medicine in which taking a good history is vital. It should be conducted in a systematic way using good interview techniques. A clear knowledge of signs of mental illness (e.g. delusions, hallucinations) is essential for an accurate assessment of a patient's difficulties. This should allow the clinician to reach a differential diagnosis, and to estimate how much confidence can be placed in the primary diagnosis. Although there are few diagnostic tests in psychiatry, appropriate investigation of patients includes an assessment of their physical health (and whether this might relate to their psychiatric presentation), a formal and detailed assessment of their cognitive function (which can help characterize or localize possible brain pathology), objective ratings of the severity of symptoms, and neuroimaging.",

      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common occurrence in the United States, with an estimated incidence exceeding 1 million injuries per year. Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical impairments are common sequelae of TBI and may, in a significant minority of patients, persist well into the late period following injury. The etiology of these symptoms in individuals with mild TBI is controversial, with hypotheses of postconcussive symptom formation variously ascribing greater or lesser weight to neural damage, pre- and/or post-injury psychological or psychiatric factors, somatization, malingering, or some combination of these. Some of these hypotheses reflect biases common to medicolegal or compensation-related contexts, whereas others are derived from recent neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies. Studies of the latter sort suggest that many of the typical postconcussive symptoms are associated with neurobiological dysfunction in one or more areas of the central nervous system. Whether these symptoms constitute a postconcussive syndrome per se is debatable. Instead, it may be more accurate to describe them as commonly co-occurring symptoms rather than as a syndromal sequela of TBI. The present review addresses these issues including the epidemiology and course of recovery from mild TBI and the validity of the postconcussive syndrome. Suggestions regarding the assessment and treatment of individuals with post-concussive symptoms are offered.",

Presentamos el caso de un varón de 90 años con antecedentes de degeneración macular asociada a la edad avanzada y ceguera legal, que consultó por la aparición de alucinaciones visuales nítidas, complejas y estructuradas, reconocidas por él como irreales. Las alucinaciones incluían figuras humanas, animales y escenas en movimiento, sin componente auditivo ni afectación emocional asociada. El examen psiquiátrico reveló un estado cognitivo conservado (MMSE 28/30) y sin signos de psicosis o demencia. La evaluación geriátrica integral mostró una buena funcionalidad general, y la neuroimagen descartó lesiones estructurales cerebrales. Ante la ausencia de patología neurológica o psiquiátrica concomitante, se estableció la impresión diagnóstica de SCB. El manejo incluyó psicoeducación al paciente y a su familia, optimización del entorno visual y una pauta baja de quetiapina (12,5 mg/noche) con buena tolerancia y respuesta favorable. El caso subraya la importancia del reconocimiento del SCB en el contexto de la pérdida visual severa en personas mayores. El desconocimiento del síndrome puede llevar a diagnósticos erróneos de demencia o psicosis, con consecuencias innecesarias. Un abordaje multidisciplinar centrado en la educación, el soporte visual y, en casos seleccionados, el tratamiento farmacológico sintomático, puede mejorar significativamente la calidad de vida del paciente.",

If they are due to positive symptoms, drug adverse effects or depression they are named as secondary negative symptoms. Treatment approach depends on whether negative symptoms are primary or secondary. Deficit syndrome is described by primary negative symptoms presenting at the beginning of disease, emerging spontaneously and staying stable during the disease course. Recent reports showed that deficit syndrome differ on disease course based on neurocognitive measures, functioning, and structural imaging. The role of negative symptoms in clinical diversity of schizophrenia was aimed to be evaluated in this paper by elobarating negative symptoms in various dimensions such as clinical features, biological measures, quality of life, and response to treatment.",

      "abstract": "One of the challenges in acute stroke management is accurately differentiating between actual ischemic events and other conditions that mimic stroke. In a cohort of 821 consecutive patients admitted to an acute stroke unit, 13% were incorrectly diagnosed as stroke [1]. In another cohort of 411 patients, it was estimated that 19% of patients presenting to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms ultimately have other diagnoses such as a postictal state, metabolic disturbances, and systemic infections [2]. Regardless of the actual percentage, it is clear that not all cases of acute stroke-like symptoms are true strokes and other mimics should be considered. One such mimic is factitious disorder. \r\nFactitious disorder is a psychiatric condition in which afflicted individuals exaggerate symptoms and even endorse medical illness, or psychological trauma in order to draw attention or sympathy to themselves. The DSM-IV criteria for this disorder are: 1) Intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological signs or symptoms; 2) The motivation for the behavior is to assume the sick role; and 3)\r\nExternal incentives for the behavior such as economic gain or avoiding legal responsibility as seen in malingering, are absent [3].\r\nHere, we present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with factitious disorder after he presented to two different institutions with acute stroke-like symptoms and received tissue plasminogen activator\r\n(t-PA) twice within the span of 3 weeks.",

A growing number of brain imaging studies in irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis has identified abnormalities in evoked brain responses, resting state activity, and connectivity, as well as in gray and white matter properties. Structural and functional alterations in brain regions of the salience, emotional arousal, and sensorimotor networks, as well as in prefrontal regions, are the most consistently reported findings. Some of these changes show moderate correlations with behavioral and clinical measures. Most recently, data-driven machine-learning approaches to larger data sets have been able to classify visceral pain syndromes from healthy control subjects.

      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

Define-se o delirio, e segundo Carlos Centeno, como estado confusional agudo que deriva de uma disfuncao cerebral orgânica de etiologia multifactorial. Dependendo dos autores, varia de 28% a 85%. O delirio e um dos sintomas mais dificeis de diagnosticar e tratar, e tambem aquele que provoca maior deterioracao da qualidade de vida do doente e da sua relacao com a familia, cuidadores ou equipa de apoio. A sua presenca condiciona maiores dificuldades na avaliacao da dor, de outros sintomas ou problemas, - a obstipacao, a retencao urinaria, febre, a infeccao respiratoria ou urinaria, desidratacao, etc., - pela perturbacao que causa na comunicacao com o doente e por impedir uma participacao nas decisoes que dizem respeito a sua doenca. Apesar de ser uma situacao esperada no final de vida, pode no entanto, ser reversivel ou controlavel em cerca de 25-45% dos casos, pelo que na sua abordagem deve-se ter em conta esta caracteristica, individualizando-se caso a caso, transmitindo a familia a esperanca da reversibilidade. \nNa doenca avancada, o delirio manifesta-se por: perturbacoes cognitivas, disturbios do comportamento psicomotor, com uma instalacao aguda ou subaguda, com flutuacoes durante o dia, agravando-se para a noite, podendo adoptar uma forma hiperactiva (a mais frequente) e uma forma hipoactiva. O delirio, normalmente de etiologia multifactorial, condiciona um conjunto de medidas de intervencao que passam por: terapeutica dirigida a causa, intervencao no comportamento do doente e no ambiente, apoio a familia e o tratamento sintomatico, sobretudo fazendo uso correcto dos varios tipos de neurolepticos, assim como outro tipo de intervencoes farmacologicas.",

Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen. Probleme liegen hier in der Abgrenzung der normalen psychischen Betroffenheit nach einem Schadensereignis.

Seizures (altered brain wave [electrophysiological] patterns) present clinically as abnormal consciousness with or without tonic/clonic convulsions (where \"tonic\" = stiffening and \"clonic\" = involuntary rhythmical movements). Neuropathological findings following seizures may be detected using many methods. Neuro-imaging may show a structural abnormality underlying seizures, such as focal cortical dysplasia or hippocampal sclerosis in patients with chronic epilepsy. Neural cell type-specific biomarkers in blood or cerebrospinal fluid may highlight neuronal damage and/or glial reactions but are not specific indicators of seizures while serum electrolyte and glucose imbalances may induce seizures. Gross observations and brain weights generally are unaffected by TAs with seizurogenic potential, but microscopic evaluation may reveal seizure-related neuron death in some brain regions (especially neocortex, hippocampus, and/or cerebellum). Current globally accepted best practices for neural sampling in nonclinical general toxicity studies provide a suitable screen for brain regions that are known sites of electrical disruption and/or display seizure-induced neural damage. Conventional nonclinical studies can afford an indication that a TA has a potential seizure liability (via in-life signs and/or microscopic evidence of neuron necrosis), but confirmation requires measuring brain electrical (electroencephalographic) activity in a nonclinical study.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Capacity assessments are performed when there is suspicion that a person is unable to adequately care for their physical, medical, or financial well‐being. The purpose of these assessments is to inform the legal system as to whether or not guardianship may be necessary. It is well established that certain mental illnesses, such as neurocognitive disorders (dementia) or psychotic disorders (like schizophrenia), may diminish capacity and, in some cases, lead to the need for establishment of a legal guardian. However, personality disorders are another common category of mental illness which may impair decision‐making. There is very little information in the literature about how or why these disorders could impair capacity, and thus, it can often be difficult to discern whether clients with personality disorders are substantially unable to care for themselves—versus unwilling to act in a way contrary to their ingrained habits. We present a series of three cases in which clients are determined to lack capacity primarily mediated by a personality disorder diagnosis. They are demonstrated to have mild deficits in cognitive functioning, but they show impaired decision‐making out of proportion to these deficits. In all three cases, it is apparent that the personality disorder is substantially impairing their ability to care for themselves. Discussion includes consideration for ways to incorporate evaluations of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and personality considerations into capacity assessments, and how to approach recommendations (such as guardianship vs. less restrictive option) based on both level and scope of impairment.",

As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

It is not a diagnosis in isolation as peripheral nerves are damaged consequent to some other condition, such as systemic exposure to exogenous agents in the environment and workplace. In subjects at risk, it is important to determine if and when peripheral nerves become affected, hopefully before clinical dysfunction and permanent damage occur. Many studies have employed clinical, electrophysiological, quantitative psychophysical sensory, and pathological procedures in the investigation of peripheral nerve disease. Their success has been less than optimal, mostly because of complexities in the peripheral nervous system and inherent procedural limitations.\n\nPeripheral neuropathies can be divided into:\n\n\n\n\n\nOther subdivisions are based on the predominant site of dysfunction:\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also different types of peripheral nerve fibres: motor, sensory, and autonomic.

Absolute constipation and urgent surgical referral is mandatory. Change in bowel habit in association with low back pain may be due to cauda equina syndrome, which is a neurosurgical emergency. If this condition is suspected, an urgent Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine should be performed and a neurosurgical review arranged. Lower spinal cord pathology may cause spastic paraparesis or loss of lower limb sensation. Cauda equina syndrome is associated with flaccid lower limb weakness and loss of lower limb sensation.

Many different disorders affecting many different parts of the nervous system can manifest with \"weakness,\" and several nonneurologic conditions may present with complaints of weakness. It is the job of the neurologist to determine whether a patient has neurologic weakness or suffers simply from fatigue. The physician then must properly localize the pathophysiologic site of weakness. The author focuses on neuromuscular causes of weakness affecting muscle, the neuromuscular junction, peripheral nerve, or the anterior horn cell. General historical and examination clues to localization will be discussed. A localization-based evaluation will be outlined, with more specific recommendations regarding the evaluation of a few specific disorders offered. Localization-specific laboratory, electrodiagnostic, imaging, and pathologic investigations will be presented.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "title": "Review of Delusional Jealousy and Its Association with Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Introduction Mental state changes can affect one’s sexual life, while sexual dysfunction can lead to relationship challenges. Delusional jealousy, also called Othello syndrome, involves a paranoid belief in a partner’s infidelity, leading to controlling and violent behaviors. It can manifest as a paranoid disorder, as a delusional symptom of psychiatric, neurological or other medical conditions, or as side effect of dopaminergic medication. Although its exact prevalence remains uncertain, it has been identified in 0.5-1.4% of psychiatry inpatients. Objectives To describe sexual dysfunctions associated with delusional jealousy and to explore strategies for addressing these dysfunction. Methods A non-systematic review of the literature available at PubMed was conducted using the keywords “Sexual Dysfunction” AND “Delusional Jealousy OR Othello Syndrome”. Results A number of factors, including sexual dysfunction, can trigger or exacerbate delusional jealousy. This is especially true for middle-aged men who have a history of alcohol consumption, neurological or personality disorders. Individuals with sexual dysfunction experience feelings of insecurity, projecting these concerns onto their partners and suspecting extramarital relationships. On the other hand, sexual dysfunctions such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Female Sexual Arousal and Orgasmic Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction and Ejaculation Disturbance may occur as consequence of Othello Syndrome. Multiple factors contribute to these dysfunctions, including increased testosterone and cortisol levels, chronic alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric conditions and antipsychotics. There are reports of increased sexual desire, especially in cases of dementia. Conclusions Although the evidence is limited and dated, it points to a bidirectional association between delusional jealousy and sexual dysfunction. Further studies are essential to determine the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunctions in Othello syndrome, and the causal relationship between them. Additionally, investigating gender differences is crucial, given the male-centric focus of existing studies. This research can contribute to clinical care by promoting the screening for sexual issues and their integration into delusional jealousy management. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

      "title": "Support of workers with Developmental Disorders",
      "abstract": "Support for the workers with Developmental Disorders is one of the important issues in occupational mental health. Major symptoms such as deficits in social reciprocity, deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, which are common in Developmental Disorders, strongly affect work performance. Some workers with Developmental Disorders suffer from other psychiatric conditions because of maladjustment to the work environment, while the manifestation of Developmental Disorders in workers is also influenced by the work environment. Occupational health staff should have sufficient of understanding of the difficulties and psychological suffering of such workers to be able to support their health and continuous employment. Support for mild cases as well as severe cases is sometimes difficult because it may give the impression of unfairness or cause a degeneration of morale among co-workers. It is necessary to have detailed discussions about the future development of support systems for workers with Developmental Disorders.",

Patients may present predominantly with problems in naming and understanding words, or in face and object recognition, the verbal or nonverbal predominance reflecting the accent of atrophy on the left or right temporal lobe. Behavioural changes may occur, although these have a more obsessional quality than is typically seen in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, overlap in clinical symptomatology of semantic dementia and FTD may occur with disease progression reinforcing the link between these clinical syndromes. Semantic dysfunction is poorly recognized and may be mistaken for the amnesia of Alzheimer’s disease, yet may be important in explaining some of the behavioural characteristics seen in focal cerebral degeneration.",

Especially if the patient has subjective somatic symptoms for which there is no apparent organic reason it may be important to motivate the patient to examine all the different factors that contribute to the vicious circle he/she often enters into. The following elements of this circle are explained: Physical (symptoms, signs, findings), beliefs (thoughts, cognitive processes and cognitive schemas), feelings (emotions), behaviour (all we say and do) and the so-called X-factor, which represents everything we do not know. The model might help us in our relationship to the patients, and can be used both in connection with known somatic disease and with conditions with a multifactorial genesis, like somatoform disorders.",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes. An EEG makes it possible, at any rate, to differentiate between the petit mal statuses and the temporal lobe statuses.

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms. Endogenous DepressionLet us take endogenous depression first.Though less common and less likely to be overlooked, the more severe cases will be described first.The onset is usually gradual, the patient often looks ill, his skin may be sallow and dry, the hair lustreless, and",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a speciality of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and study of mental diseases or disorders. Its practitioners are psychiatrists (in the United States, physicians who complete four years of approved training following their 148graduation from medical school). A number of professionals from other disciplines treat patients with psychiatric disorders. The most important of these are clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. They commonly refer to those who seek help as 'clients' rather than 'patients'. These professionals may work in various collaborative relationships with psychiatrists or as independent practitioners. They employ the same verbal therapies as psychiatrists. Psychiatry differs from these specialities in being a medical discipline whose practitioners are physicians. As such, psychiatrists are specifically trained to (1) make precise syndromal or aetiological diagnoses, whenever possible, and distinguish one syndrome from another; (2) diagnose (or know when to refer to other physicians) those organic conditions which mimic psychiatric disorders such as brain tumour, cancer of the pancreas, and hyperthyroidism (these conditions can present as anxiety or depressive disorders); (3) treat particular psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications or other somatic treatments; (4) manage untoward psychological reactions to medical illness; and (5) integrate the biological with the psychological and social dimensions of mental disorders. In addition, the psychiatrist's training in medicine may encourage a research career in the biology of mental disorders. American psychiatrists as a whole have a high level of expertise in psychological treatments, particularly the psychodynamic approach. This is due to the impact of psychoanalytic theory on academic psychiatry especially since 1945, when many distinguished psychoanalysts assumed the chairs of academic departments.",

Formalet med denne oppgaven er a presentere oppdatert kunnskap om arsaksforhold og patofysiologien bak de ikke-rytmiske hyperkinetiske bevegelsesforstyrrelsene som dystoni, chorea, atetose, ballisme, myoklonus, tics og hemifaciale spasmer.\n\nResultat: Samme type sykdomsprosess kan fore til ulike bevegelsesforstyrrelser, samtidig som ulik sykdomsprosess kan gi lik bevegelsesforstyrrelse. I tillegg kan lesjoner pa anatomisk forskjellig steder fore til lik klinikk. Dette belyser at det kanskje ikke finnes ett fasitsvar. Mye tyder pa at sluttresultatet er en dysfunksjon av den kortikostriatale-thalamokortikale motoriske krets. Generelt er hyperkinetiske lidelser assosiert med redusert basalganglie output, men sannsynligvis har endringer i frekvens og fyringsmonster vel sa stor betydning som den totale impulsaktiviteten. Nevronal kommunikasjonsfeil, endret plastisitet og synaptisk regulering star sentralt i patofysiologien. Det at flere av de ufrivillige bevegelsene responderer pa antidopaminerg behandling, indikerer at dopamin har betydning i utvikling av symptomene. Det foreligger ogsa holdepunkter for at andre monoaminerge transmittersubstanser spiller en rolle i denne sammenheng. Det er rapportert sensoriske fenomener ved flere av lidelsene. Sporsmalet blir derfor om somatosensorisk integrering har en storre plass i patofysiologien enn tidligere antatt.\n\nKonklusjon: Det foreligger mye kunnskap om etiologi pa samtlige lidelser. Noen arsaker er apenbare, som for eksempel neoplastiske og vaskulaere lesjoner. Der arsaken ikke er like tydelig har man holdepunkter for en multifaktoriell etiologi. Det er fortsatt mye ulost innen dette omradet av nevrologien og det kreves stor forskningsinnsats i fremtiden.%%%%Background:\nInvoluntary movements are a very heterogeneous group of disorders. The purpose of this study is to present current knowledge about etiology and pathophysiology underlying the non-rythmic hyperkinetic movement disorders like dystonia, chorea, athetosis, ballism, myoclonus, tics and hemifacial spasms.\nResults: \nSame type of disease process can lead to various movement disorders, while various disease process can cause similar movement disorder. Additionally, lesions on anatomically different locations can lead to the same clinicical picture. This illuminate that there might not be a single definite answer. Much indicates that the end result is a dysfunction of the corticostriatal-thalamocortical motor circuit. In general, hyperkinetic disorders are associated with reduced basalganglie output, but probably are changes in frequency and firing pattern just as important as the total impulse activity. Failure in neuronal communication, altered synaptic plasticity and regulation, are key concepts in the pathophysiology. The fact that several of the involuntary movements are responding to antidopaminerg treatment, indicates that dopamine plays an important role in the development of the symptoms.

However, there is no generally accepted classification of such disorders. In this paper the authors tried to show that functional autonomic pathology corresponds to the concept of somatoform disorders combining syndromes manifested by visceral, borderline psychopathological, neurological symptoms that do not have an organic basis. The relevance of the problem of somatoform disorders is that on the one hand many health professionals are not familiar enough with manifestations of borderline neuropsychiatric disorders, often forming functional autonomic disorders, and on the other hand they overestimate somatoform symptoms that are similar to somatic diseases.",

The word schizophrenia is used to describe a disorder that causes changes in perception, thinking and behavior of an individual. The factors triggers of schizophrenia are diverse and some of them are not yet clearly established despite the many studies that have occurred over the years. The affectation of this disorder is multiple and covers not only functional impairment, but affects other important areas such as: attention, memory, concentration, reasoning ability and executive function. The continuing deterioration in all these areas can cause new disorders such as motor disability or inappropriate social behavior such as insulation, reduction of interest and lack of motivation for daily activities. The therapeutic proposals that occur in the area are multiple, but excel integrative therapies by the very fact that this disease has a level of impairment in several areas of the subject's life. Therefore between the therapies most used they are psychosocial therapy, Social Skills Training, Neuropsychological and cognitive behavioral therapy.In the course of this disease the approach is not only psychological but also psychiatric, ie there is a multidisciplinary approach involves administration of drugs with the objective of controlling positive symptoms. The positive evolution of the patient will depend entirely on the effectiveness of treatment, which is important for an correct clinical diagnosis, identifying the symptomatology and mentioning the severity of symptoms.",

The path from medical illness to depression reflects general mechanisms related to stress, disability, and loss, as well as more specific physiological mechanisms, including those related to subclinical cerebrovascular disease, adverse drug effects, and endocrine/metabolic effects. Similarly the path from depression to medical illness includes general mechanisms related to self-neglect, decreased adherence to medical treatments, maladaptive health-related behaviors, and, possibly, more specific physiological mechanisms including those related to altered endocrine and autonomic functions, in the clinical context, these two paths can interact to constitute a vicious cycle.

The patient would acknowledge they can hear the noise. Then the patient is either blindfolded or asked to close his or her eyes while repeating the examination. When the tuning fork is placed on the vertex of the head the patient has the ability to hear the noise in the good ear, which causes lateralization.

      "title": "Action myoclonus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and other cerebellar myoclonic syndromes.",
      "abstract": "Action myoclonus, reviewed in this chapter, is the term applied to arrhythmic muscular jerking induced by voluntary movement. It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.",

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica.

Central monoaminergic (noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic) neural networks, limbic structures, the sympathoadrenal system, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the immune system are considered the most important stress pathways. Their activation determines stress reactivity and pathological consequences on exposure to situations of distress. Both trauma and long-term stress can cause alterations in the activities of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks within the central nervous system. These neurohormonal changes are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disturbance thought to be one of the most serious psychiatric illnesses. PTSD may develop in individuals after exposure to a traumatic event (war, violence, accident) and is manifested by various symptoms, such as re-experiencing, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, impaired memory of the event, sleep disorders, nightmares, panic attacks, and depression. In this review the neurohormonal changes associated with experiencing stress are presented to highlight the molecular and hormonal basis of PTSD.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain can strictly be defined as pains due to a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system and accordingly a series of different conditions may give rise to a neuropathic pain picture. Common elements in neuropathic pain such as sensory deficit in the painful area, hypersensitivity phenomena in the painful area, aftersensations, gradual increase of pain following repetitive stimulation, and paroxysms of pain have raised the question whether these pains represent a clinical entity. According to some studies, neuropathic pain can be identified by simple screening tools, but other studies have questioned this notion. A major problem in the classification and grading of neuropathic pain is the lack of a specific diagnostic tool to diagnose these conditions, and some screening tools are subject to bias if the diagnostic instrument is used to define the condition. In certain pain conditions the symptoms and their underlying mechanisms may interact in an unpredictable fashion and add to the complexity of the clinical picture. This is particularly evident in mixed pain states. Screening tools have been shown to be useful in identifying neuropathic pain as a symptom with a reasonably high sensitivity and specificity. However, these tools can usually not distinguish one neuropathic pain condition from another. The underlying pathology of pain, which is an important element in classifying neuropathic pains will most likely influence both the choice of treatment and the prognosis of the condition, so a clinical assessment is always an important step in the work-up of patients with neuropathic pain.",

      "title": "The role of the nurse in the assessment and treatment of pain in oncological patients",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, pain along with respiratory rate, body temperature, hart rate, arterial blood pressure breathing, temperature, pulse and pressure is considered the fifth vital sign. It is often stated that the pain is the most common symptom in clinical practice, a frequent cause of functional impairment of individual inability to function in a normal way, and the most common reason for seeking medical help. In patients who suffer from a long-term feeling of intense pain, efficiency and working ability are reduced and their emotional state is damaged as well. Due to long-term treatment and damaged everyday functioning, these patients often find themselves as social and financial issues. Knowledge about pain goes back far into the history of medical science and says that pain is a symptom of disease and will disappear when the underlying disease is cured. Nowadays, especially the chronic pain is identified as an independent health issue that can and must be treated. The pain is not only the transmission of impulses from the place of injury to the perception area of the brain but a phenomenon that is influenced by factors quantitative, qualitative and sensory, as well as cultural, social and economic. In addition to physical damage, the combination of psychological, social and spiritual component leads us to the concept of total pain definition. Therefore, it is necessary to act to all these causes for complete pain relief. Pain is an important public health issue worldwide. Despite the tremendous progress of science with new technological discoveries and pharmacological agents, pain is still a worldwide problem. It is a basic human right to live without pain, which means that the health care system is responsible to provide help to anyone who feels pain.",

      "abstract": "Neurotic syndromes are defined by characteristic patterns of symptoms, but the validity of the distinction between one syndrome and another depends on associations between the syndromes and clinical history, or treatment response factors that are independent of the defining phenomena. In both a group of twin volunteers and a group of patients with panic disorder/agoraphobia, the lifetime experience of more than one diagnosis of a neurotic syndrome was common but there was no evidence of patterns of co-occurrence of diagnoses being associated with particular syndromes. Receiving a diagnosis was associated with abnormal scores on measures of neuroticism and locus of control, the extent of the abnormality increasing with the number of different diagnoses satisfied. It is argued that the concept of a general neurotic syndrome depends in part on the presence of such predisposing personality factors, and that reduction in this predisposition to neurosis should be the focus of treatment.",

It purports to explain clicking, pain, and abnormal movement at the TMJ by spasm of the masticatory muscles caused by emotional disorder. The meaning of dysfunction is not agreed upon, but by any definition, the symptoms of pain and dysfunction do not characterize a syndrome distinct from structural diseases of the TMJ. The evidence adduced to show that TMJ symptoms commonly arise in the masticatory muscles, and specifically, that they are due to spasm of those muscles, does not prove these hypotheses. Neither a general nor a specific emotional basis for most cases of TMJ symptoms has been demonstrated. The concept of pain-dysfunction syndrome should be discarded, and TMJ symptoms should be ascribed to specific articular, muscular, and/or psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Background−Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition with relapsing periods of neurological disabilities which is often followed by a progressive stage of disability accumulation. Depending upon the area where demyelination has occurred, the neurological manifestations vary: patients may be visually impaired with adequate motor function or have normal vision with tetraparesis, for example. Likewise, they may have good coordination and cognitive dysfunction or lack of coordination and adequate cognitive abilities. Multiple sclerosis typically affects young adults who may be willing to drive and may be completely fit or partially/totally unfit to do so. Methods−The authors performed a systematic review of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement. Results−Twenty-seven papers on the subject were identified. The majority of these papers agree that MS may negatively influence the ability to drive, particularly when patients have physical and/or cognitive and/or emotional disabilities. The heterogeneity of methods and assessments in these papers make it difficult to draw conclusions and so aid clear legislation on the subject. Conclusion−There is no specific literature on driving abilities in patients with MS that assists in creating legislation.",

Dichos sintomas varian desde la ansiedad e irritabilidad moderadas, hasta la depresion severa. Es frecuente que los sintomas premenstruales sean una exacerbacion de los sintomas de tipo ansioso y depresivo que estan presentes a lo largo de todo el ciclo, pero esta no es una regla. En el presente trabajo se discuten algunas hipotesis que se han emitido acerca de la relacion que existe entre los neurotransmisores, las hormonas gonadales y la depresion. Se han ensayado diversos tratamientos para el SPM, especialmente el hormonal y el psicofarmacologico. Con respecto al tratamiento hormonal, los reportes son contradictorios. Esto se puede deber a que no se ha podido demostrar que haya una anomalia hormonal simple en la etiologia del SPM. Parece mas acertada la idea de que los sintomas del SPM sean consecuencia de algunos cambios aun desconocidos en la interaccion funcional que hay entre las hormonas gonadales y los neurotransmisores cerebrales. Es por ello que los resultados del tratamiento del SPM con psicofarmacos son mas alentadores, particularmente con algunos derivados de las dibenzodiacepinas. Esto hace suponer que el control del estado ansioso/depresivo que aparece en el SPM, junto con el control del dolor periferico asociado, constituye el modelo terapeutico mas racional.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "abstract": "The fact that general practitioner (GP) or psychiatrist understands the psychosocial effects of prescribing on the doctor-patient relationship is as important, if not more so, than knowing pharmacology. Any prescription of drugs modifies the doctor-patient relationship. Drugs, especially psychotropic drugs, act on symptoms and change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; they can create both physical and psychological dependency; they can discourage a deep search for real solutions, both on the part of the doctor and the patient; they can affect the doctor’s access to the patient and the problem will be out of their reach. Psychotropic drugs can make the effect of the doctor in himself as a drug more difficult, favor an insignificant or problematic or little human relational context, where the GP/psychiatrist does not delve into the true meaning of the symptoms, and the patient tends not to get involved, to make an emotional withdrawal, to be passive before the prescribed drug, and can result in the chronification and structuring of functional symptoms that become organic, with lack of cooperation of the doctor and the patient, and paradoxically with over-compliance or therapeutic discontinuity and the lack of pharmacological adherence, absences to appointments or delays or cancellations of visits, and the denial of responsibility of both the doctor and the patient.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue has been cited as a causal factor in industrial, medical and transportation accidents. A common theme in the accident analyses has been the lack of knowledge about fatigue effects. What types of tasks are most susceptible to fatigue? How are the effects manifested? To answer these questions this article reviews the basic research on fatigue effects on performance of laboratory tasks. Tasks were categorised as vigilance, cognitive or psychomotor. Fatigue (as induced by sleep loss) consistently degrades vigilance performance regardless of task. Decrements include increased reaction time and decreased accuracy. For cognitive tasks, however, some researchers have reported increased time and decreased accuracy associated with fatigue, but not on all tasks or not consistently. For example, categorisation tasks show both decrements and no effects. Similar inconsistency exists for math (decrements and no decrements) and logical reasoning. However, fatigue consistently degrades tracking performance either performed alone or in a battery of tasks. In summary the research supports that at least in some cases of fatigue, humans cannot ‘see straight’, cannot ‘think straight’, cannot ‘do anything right’, cannot ‘seem to pay attention’ and cannot ‘lift a finger’.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by delusion, hallucination, formal thought disorder, disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms (e.g. emotional blunting, decreased initiative, impoverished speech etc.) and cognitive dysfunction. Though not described as diagnostic criteria, cognitive dysfunction is the strongest determinant of functional recovery as it has a gradual deteriorating effect on social and occupational functioning. It precedes coincides and outlasts positive symptoms. Among different cognitive abilities it affects attention, memory, processing speed, social cognition and executive function most. Recent studies are showing schizophrenia affects those who have compromised cognitive function or low IQ. Moreover different brain imaging techniques have shown structural and functional abnormality in certain areas. This article has tried to answer few questions like, are cognitive dysfunctions inevitable in schizophrenic patients and if it is then what are the areas what is the nature of affection. It is also important to know how and why they affect the long term outcome of this disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When encountering medical symptoms such as motor paralysis, clinicians typically have to distin guish between (at least) two types of potential diagnosis. The first, more traditionally biomedical is that the paralysis originates from some demonstrable pathology of the peripheral or central nervous system; the second does not fulfil this criterion and the paralysis can be broadly considered as an ‘unexplained medical symptom’ or, more specifically, as an ‘unexplained neurological symptom’ (Brown and Ron 2002). Inclusion within this second group, however, could occur for a number of different reasons-none of which is mutually exclusive. It may be that an underlying pathological agent does in fact exist but has yet to be identified. In this case, it may just be a matter of time, test sensitivity and technical breakthrough before a proven physiological abnormality and a relevant causal link will be established. On the other hand, no underlying structural pathology may be",

      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

Few studies have investigated public attitudes towards distinguishing normal from pathological grief. An international sample of 348 participants from a wide range of cultures was asked if certain expressions of grief could be considered a mental disorder and to explain their answer. Analysis revealed that the majority (74.7%) agreed that grief could be considered a mental disorder. The presence of pervasive distress, of harm to self and/or others, functional impairment, and persistent grief were described as the circumstances under which grief can be a mental disorder. Reasons grief is not a mental disorder were that it is normal, temporary, in response to an event, and that efforts to include it in diagnostic manuals will lead to medicalization and stigma. The investigation of public norms informs the inclusion of pathological grief in diagnostic nosology.",

We express emotions, perform daily activities, and communicate through the use of skeletal muscle. It is therefore not surprising that physical therapists are confronted each day by patients whose symptoms may vary but who share a common problem—that of muscle dysfunction. This dysfunction may express itself as weakness or as inappropriate movement, both of which can lead to pathokinesiological disorders that result in diminished abilities and, at times, severe pain. In addition to the symptoms our patients report and the signs that can be observed, muscle dysfunction may create stresses on other biological elements, such as bones, joints, and the cardiovascular system. Over time, these stresses can lead to damage of nonmuscular tissue.",

Prevalence of schizophrenia is around 1% of the world population. Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10 (ICD-10 or MKB-X) or the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with social rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Usually family members and friends try to convince the patient that they need the treatment which is often seen as a problem since schizophrenic patients more often than not do not have insight of their condition and do not recognise the symptoms that help doctors to diagnose their condition. The improvement of state of schizophrenic person correlates with family members' involvement in the life of schizophrenic person since family members are able to notice causes of negative behaviour and are able to intervene before symptoms of schizophrenia manifest.",

These behavior changes can be seen early in the course of PD and may antedate motor dysfunction, providing empirical evidence for an “organic” rather than reactive etiology. Postmortem and in vivo biochemical as well as neuroimaging studies lend support to this hypothesis, with mesolimbic dopamine and serotonin abnormalities and fronto-limbic dysfunction demonstrated in affected patient subgroups.3\n\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms can also begin later in the illness suggesting that additional factors, acting in concert with ongoing neurodegenerative changes, are important in their etiology. These factors include progressive and fluctuating motor symptoms, medication side effects, premorbid personality traits, psychosocial stressors, and the presence of medical, neurologic, and psychiatric comorbidity.4 It is not yet clear how these factors interact or which are most critical, a fact underscored by the absence of neurobehavioral signs in many patients with seemingly comparable disease features and risk factors.\n\nNonetheless, most neuropsychiatric syndromes are usually attributed to selective dysfunction of specific prefrontal and limbic cortical-striatal-thalamic pathways.5 This conceptual approach directly parallels strategies used to delineate physiologic and biochemic abnormalities mediating motor symptoms.6 Classic lesion-deficit studies support such links, with onset of depression, mania, …",

Symptoms and signs such as neuropathic pain and tinnitus and hyperactive disorders such as muscle spasm and synkinesis may result from such changes in function. Plastic changes that cause symptoms of diseases can be initiated by novel stimulations, overstimulation, or deprivation of input and the induced changes in the function of central nervous system structures may persist and aggravate after these events have ceased if the condition is not reversed. Disorders that are caused by neural plasticity are potentially reversible with treatment. However, the absence of morphologic abnormalities makes diagnosis of these conditions difficult and their treatment has been hampered by lack of understanding of their pathophysiology.

It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem.

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life‐threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured‐individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

      "title": "Clinical Effectiveness of Tofrānil in the Treatment of Depressive Psychoses",
      "abstract": "FrenchDeux hypothèses opposées continuent à embrouiller le traitement pharmacologique des psychoses dépressives:1° La dépression résulte d'une déficience biochimique, marquée par la diminution de l'énergie psychocinétique. Elle doit être traitée par des méthodes stimulantes et énergétiques.2° Les états dépressifs sont des troubles multidimensionnels des fonctions psycho-biologiques. Il est impossible de les exprimer sous la forme d'un simple antagonisme.L'étude clinique des effets du Tofrānil a fait supposer dès le début que ce corps exerçait une activité sélective sur les syndromes dépressifs. On observe rarement une action mentale spécifique, au sens d'un syndrome psycho-affectif provoqué par la médication. Ni l'euphorie, ni la stimulation psychocinétique ne marchent régulièrement de pair avec les effets du Tofrānil sur le cerveau. La caractéristique thérapeutique de ce corps est une dissolution du syndrome dépressif, et une restauration de l'état affectif normal.Un fait étonnant est que le spectre de cette activité thérapeutique demeure discontinu. Alors que, dès le début des recherches, il a paru évident que le Tofrānil exerce son action optimale sur les dépressions accompagnées d'inhibition, on ne peut pas toujours escompter le résultat du traitement, du fait que certains sujets avec symptômes d'inhibition typiques ne sont nullement améliorés, tandis que d'autres voient leur état se modifier de façon impressionnante.L'attention des chercheurs s'est concentrée sur l'identification des facteurs psychopathologiques qui semblent particulièrement sensibles à l'action du Tofrānil. De tels symptômes ont été sélectionnés tant dans le domaine du comportement, que sur le plan psychosomatique et le plan expérimental. Au für et à mesure des progrès de la thérapeutique, il a été possible de préciser les signes, ou les groupes de signes, susceptibles de modification, ainsi que ceux qui demeuraient réfractaires au traitement. Les appréciations finales sont basées sur l'élimination totale ou partielle des symptômes-clés. Cette analyse phénoménologique s'est avérée très précieuse dans les recherches psychopharmacologiques entreprises pour identifier les effets différentiels des agents thérapeutiques.L'auteur cherche ensuite à déterminer si l'action thérapeutique est suspensive, correctrice ou préventive. Le matériel clinique comporte en première ligne des malades atteints de psychoses dépressives et hospitalisés. Il englobe, en outre, un groupe de patients en traitement ambulatoire, dont l'anamnèse présente de fréquents accès de dépression. L'auteur cherche, pour finir, à répondre à la question de savoir si les indications relatives du Tofrānil et du traitement électroconvulsif peuvent être formulées. Il se base pour cela sur des expériences de thérapeutique comparée, entreprises avec le même matériel clinique.",

One barrier to addressing impaired insight is the absence of a comprehensive model of how poor insight develops.To explore this issue we review how poor insight is the result of multiple phenomena which interfere with the construction of narrative accounts of psychiatric challenges, rather than a single social or biological cause. Expert commentary: We propose an integrative model of poor insight in schizophrenia which involves the interaction of symptoms, deficits in neurocognition, social cognition, metacognition, and stigma. Emerging treatments for poor insight including therapies which focus on the development of metacognition are discussed.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors.

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

      "abstract": "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a poorly understood chronic pain condition of multifactorial origin. CRPS involves sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms primarily affecting one extremity. Patients can also present with neuropsychological changes such as reduced attention to the CRPS-affected extremity, reminiscent of hemispatial neglect, yet in the absence of any brain lesions. However, this “neglect-like” framework is not sufficient to characterise the range of higher cognitive functions that can be altered in CRPS. This comprehensive literature review synthesises evidence of neuropsychological changes in CRPS in the context of potential central mechanisms of the disorder. The affected neuropsychological functions constitute three distinct but not independent groups: distorted body representation, deficits in lateralised spatial cognition, and impairment of non-spatially-lateralised higher cognitive functions. We suggest that many of these symptoms appear to be consistent with a broader disruption to parietal function beyond merely what could be considered “neglect-like.” Moreover, the extent of neuropsychological symptoms might be related to the clinical signs of CRPS, and rehabilitation methods that target the neuropsychological changes can improve clinical outcomes in CRPS and other chronic pain conditions. Based on the limitations and gaps in the reviewed literature, we provide several suggestions to improve further research on neuropsychological changes in chronic pain.",

There are no official diagnostic criteria for cognitive repercussions of EI, which may lead to incorrect diagnostics and confusion with other most frequent causes of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia, pseudodementia, or dementias for reversible causes. In this case report, we described a right-handed man, aged 56 years old, referred to our service due to behavioral changes and cognitive alterations related to electric shock. The psychiatric team has monitored him, but cognitive deficits have raised doubts about the presence of dementia syndrome. The neuropsychological evaluation revealed severe deficits and loss of functionality, which filled the criteria for major neurocognitive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5). Adding these findings to the patient's history and after a detailed investigation of other causes of dementia, we concluded that this is a possible case of EI with strong neuropsychological symptoms. This case report should help clinicians to recognize this condition and its features.

      "title": "Démence à corps de Lewy : nouveau consensus",
      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Christian Derouesne La troisieme conference internationale sur la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL) [1] reconnait les difficultes du diagnostic liees a la faible sensibilite des criteres utilises. Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

Pain becomes chronic only when this unpleasant sensory and emotional experience persists for much longer than expected relative to the severity or duration of the initial noxious stimulus. The regions of symptom onset, patterns of radiation or referral to other body sites, and any association with loss or excess of somatic sensation within the symptomatic regions have major relevance in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. In patients who suffer from multiple pain types or regions, or in whom there coexists abnormal perception of different modes of sensory stimulation, documenting clinical data using only verbal descriptors can be overwhelming. Historically, large portions of the autonomic nervous system have been thought of as only being responsible for the creation of involuntary physiological responses to acute, stressful or noxious stimuli.",

The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether.

The physician involved in the care of these patients knows that the disease may present itself also with extramotor symptoms, which condition a more difficult management of the patient. The non-motor symptoms are classified in four categories in order of management importance: 1) disautonomic, 2) cognitive, 3) affective and 4) sensitive. These symptoms are more frequent and difficult to manage in late stage of disease, except for affective type, which may be precox and adaptive at the communication of the diagnosis or sometime precede it. The more frequent disautonomic symptoms are: constipation, symptoms related to the uro-genital sphere, the cardio-pressor regulation (orthostatic hypotension), the thermoregulation, sialorrhea dysphagia and seborrhoea. The cognitive symptoms: isolate (bradyphrenia, alteration of executive function) or dementia with or without delirium and allucinosis. The affective symptoms: depression, agitation, anxiety, panic attacks. The sensitive symptoms: pain, dysesthesia, paresthesia with bizzarre features (cold sensation, numbness, interior agitation). There are other symptoms which are not framing in the previous categories: sleep, respiratory and circulatory disorders (venous and lymphatic), which have different causal factors: emotional-affective, motor and iatrogenic. The therapeutic intervention on these symptoms is of essential importance in the management of the patient with Parkinson's disease, with a great impact on his quality of life. Here are analyzed the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for each symptom.",

      "title": "Non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments act on the same brain",
      "abstract": "Treatment strategies for major psychiatric disorders, including affective and anxiety disorders, addictions and schizophrenia, include pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. These modalities might appear, at first glance, to have contrasting mechanisms of action, but their mechanisms may actually interact. Brain structure and function are altered by experience. Defined broadly, experience can include internal states that alter relevant neural pathways, external (including social) stimuli, or exposure to pharmacological agents. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological stimuli can have similar or interacting effects on behavior or brain plasticity. An example is cross-sensitization between rewarding pharmacological (including potentially addictive) stimuli and environmental stressors 1. Two psychotherapies, or two pharmacological treatments, may have complementary mechanisms of action. However, the fact that one treatment is pharmacological and the other non-pharmacological does not guarantee that they will have complementary mechanisms. Our challenge as clinicians is to determine how to use any potential treatment modalities available in the most efficient manner, especially given extensive evidence that response to single treatments is often suboptimal 2. Three kinds of stimuli that can influence the course of a psychiatric illness are the following: a) pharmacological treatment could correct imbalances that contribute to symptoms or relapse; b) external or social stimuli, including the structured stimuli provided by psychotherapies, could address the same, or different, imbalances; c) internally generated stimuli, including those resulting from the illness, and both specific and non-specific adaptations to it, could either ameliorate symptoms or make them worse. For example, episodes or exacerbations of depression, mania, anxiety or psychosis have natural histories in which, in general, they eventually resolve, though too often not before serious or tragic consequences have occurred 3. If mechanisms by which episodes eventually resolve could be identified, treatments could address them. These three classes of stimuli are likely to interact, and facilitating interactions among them can be an important aspect of successful treatment. A potential example is a pharmacological treatment which reduces susceptibility to anxiety, resulting in enhanced ability to participate in behavioral therapies aimed at broadening the individual's scope of activity. Thase et al 4 review extensive data from studies comparing combinations of pharmacological treatments with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). In some ways these studies resemble pharmacological trials in which antidepressant or antimanic monotherapies are combined with placebo or a potential augmenter such as a second-generation antipsychotic. Potential problems in pharmacological and pharmacological plus non-pharmacological combination trials are similar. The first is choice of treatments. What is the rationale for the specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy that were chosen, and the evidence that the specific treatments involved actually have complementary mechanisms? “Psychotherapy” can have neurobiological targets 5, and “pharmacotherapy” can have behavioral targets 6. Most treatment augmentation strategies have not been based on mechanism, though there are notable exceptions, such as studies of augmentation by lithium of response to antidepressant agents, which were based on complementary effects on serotonergic function 7. Different classes of antidepressants can differentially affect brain function 8 and may therefore interact differentially with specific psychotherapies or clinical characteristics. The second problem is rational selection of patients for treatments, whether based on illness course, symptom pattern, genetics, family history, or other predictors. For example, in one study, a history of more than ten previous episodes was associated with relative lack of response to CBT 9, potentially consistent with an association between treatment non-response and a sensitized course of illness. Such individuals might have synergistic response to CBT combined with a pharmacological treatment that prevents expression of sensitized behavior 1. The third problem is that pharmacological augmentation studies can be confounded by under-treatment with the medication being augmented, biasing toward a positive effect of augmentation that may not be present if the original treatment were adequately dosed. Examples include studies in mania where lithium or valproate levels were suboptimal and there was no attempt to optimize them before addition of a second-generation antipsychotic 2. The same problem can occur in antidepressant-CBT trials, so choice of medicine and dose, or of type of psychotherapy, should be considered carefully. The fourth problem is that time courses of responses to treatment may differ, or effects of one treatment may enhance (or interfere with) effects of the other, depending on timing. Finally, the so-called placebo effect is considered a nemesis of treatment studies, whether pharmacological or not. However, in real life, the placebo effect is an important part of successful treatment, as it is a physiological effect that is integral to the therapeutic alliance 10. Every pharmacological treatment has a non-pharmacological component that cannot be dissociated from it. This alliance can be fostered, or inhibited, by strategies that are nominally pharmacological or non-pharmacological. While psychotherapy potentially involves more contact and opportunity for a therapeutic alliance to develop, so-called placebo effects are inherent in any treatment and cannot be dissociated from the effect of an “active” treatment 11. Selecting and administering a treatment in a manner that fosters adaptation and resilience is likely to increase its effectiveness as well as that of concomitant treatments.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

      "abstract": "Subtle problems of perplexity, distractibility, and fatigue accompany all kinds of brain injury for they appear to result from disruption of accustomed neural pathways and loss or change of mental function. Emotional disturbances may mask these subtle problems, but they can also result from them. Clinical experience indicates that these problems are more apt to become stressful when the patient misinterprets or copes ineffectively with them. That these common problems of brain injured adults may be overlooked in the usual clinical examination was shown in a comparison of clinical records of 50 patients referred for neuropsychological consultation with records of 46 patient-participants in a longitudinal neuropsychological study. Significantly more reports of these problems appeared in the latter group of records. However, consultation records did reflect emotional distress. Irritability, depression, or anxiety affected all but six consultation patients and appeared with equal frequency among working patients as among those unable to work or needing full-time care. This suggests that some of their emotional distress resulted from less obvious problems than those impairing mobility, strength, or competency. Counseling can reduce the patient's vulnerability to the psychologically crippling effects of perplexity, distractibility, and fatigue. Specific recommendations for patient and family counseling are offered.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Brain death is the irreversible cessation of whole-brain function, which would be followed by the cessation of cardiopulmonary function without the institution of artificial measures. Recognition of the vegetative state (VS) entails a clinical diagnosis. The VS is likely to be permanent 12 months after traumatic brain injury and 3 months after nontraumatic injury in children. Minimally conscious state (MCS) is considered by some to be a neurological state whose recognition allows special legal and moral consideration.

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

      "abstract": "Am Institut fuer Rechtsmedizin Zuerich wurden zwischen 1995 und 2010 insgesamt 371 verkehrsmedizinische Untersuchungen im Zusammenhang mit einer Parkinson-Erkrankung durchgefuehrt. Parkinsonerkrankte koennen verkehrsrelevante Symptome aufweisen, die aber nicht bei jedem Erkrankten in gleicher Auspraegung vorkommen; sie koennen auch ganz fehlen. Dazu zaehlen die allgemeine Verlangsamung, kognitive Defizite wie Gedaechtnis-, Aufmerksamkeits- oder Konzentrationsstoerungen, chronische Muedigkeit und Depressionen sowie als Folge der medikamentoesen Therapie Blockierungen und Dyskinesien, ebenso wie ploetzliche Schlafattacken. Es werden die Resultate der aerztlich begleiteten Kontrollfahrten vorgestellt, die immer dann durchgefuehrt werden, wenn ein grenzwertiger kognitiver Befund oder eine Fahrauffaelligkeit beziehungsweise ein Unfall (bei unauffaellligem kognitivem Befund) vorliegt. Es hat sich bestaetigt, dass die Fahreignungsbeurteilung bei Parkinson-Patienten immer individuell erfolgen sollte und die aerztlich begleitete Kontrollfahrt eine bewaehrte Untersuchungsmethode ist.

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

The correlation of these factors considered from the viewpoint of a dynamic approach determines the course and the prognosis of epilepsy as a whole. The degree of the patient's clinical and occupational compensation serves as one of the major criteria of the assessment of the disease course and prognosis.

Some symptoms are clustered into syndromes, and provisional operational criteria, such as AD-related psychosis or depression, are proposed to facilitate their study.4,5 These symptoms have serious negative consequences for patients, including compromising quality of life and increasing impairment in activities of daily living. They are also major sources of psychological stress, depression, and burden for the caregivers.6 Studies have shown that these symptoms are linked to elder abuse and are important determinants of the institutionalization of patients with AD.7,8 Neuropsychiatric symptoms reflect the underlying neurobiological changes of the diseased brain, and many can be alleviated by psychotropic medications.9,10 Certain stage-specific patterns of the neuropsychiatric symptoms can be observed during the course of AD,11 and some symptoms may have specific value in the prediction of the disease course. For example, several studies have found that depression is a harbinger of AD;12,13 others have shown that delusions or hallucinations predict clinical or functional decline.14,15Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes cognitive impairment in the elderly not of sufficient severity to meet diagnostic criteria for dementia.

The lack of precision and relevance pertains to perception and recall as well as communication and action. The deficient potential for activation of the prefrontal cerebral cortex is a neurobiological correlate to the lesion of precise and relevant planning and expression. Impairment of formal thought and language in schizophrenia are suggested to result from a developmental disorder pertaining to language and concept formation (apperception). In reactive psychoses with dissociative disturbances of consciousness there is an inefficient capacity for adapting to external reality; thus relevant conscious planning and interaction with the outside world are impaired. Clinically a distractibility of a tematic nature ensues. Except for catastrophic events, psychotic reactions cannot be predicted from analysis of the actual experience--neither concerning the external nor the internal aspects of conscious awareness. Sometimes, however, previous events relating to the formation of the self may add explanatory value to the analysis of reactive psychosis. In some cases biological predisposition is the decisive determinant. The normal discrimination between sense-perception and imagination has a counterpart in the dichotomy of awareness of the outside world versus awareness of the self. The following are examples of psychotic experience where the normal ability for dichotomic discrimination may be damaged: Illusions of affect, hallucinations, Schneider's first rank symptoms, \"Anwesenheit\" and consciousness of time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines on cognitive impairment in bipolar disorders – Assessment and management",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Bipolar disorder (BD) affects about 0.5% of the Indian population.[1] Individuals with BD experience residual symptoms between episodes and manifest significant functional and cognitive impairments, even during remission. Patients with BD show notable cognitive impairment across all clinical states, including euthymia, even when potential confounding factors like demographic variables, medication effects, and residual depressive symptoms are controlled for.[2] Neurocognitive deficits are not only a persistent aspect of the illness but also postulated to be a fundamental primary characteristic, rather than a result of the mood state or medication.[3] A significant and widespread neurocognitive deficit reportedly exists even before the first onset of mood symptoms, persists through various phases, and often deteriorates as the illness progresses.[4–6] Cognitive functioning is a key predictor of occupational functioning in BD and may exert a greater influence than other clinical factors. Considering the widespread and negative psychosocial impact of cognitive dysfunction in the illness, it is crucial to utilize appropriate cognitive measures to enhance our understanding of the nature, severity, and correlates of cognitive deficits in the illness and to develop effective therapeutic strategies to address this cognitive impairment in BD. PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES A thorough literature search was conducted using the key words/MeSH terms neurocognition, cognitive function, cognitive deficits OR executive functions OR working memory, cognitive domains AND bipolar disorder, mania, and bipolar depression. The 1643 articles that were returned were scrutinised for relevance. In addition, the Medline search returned about 63 systematic reviews and 46 meta-analyses on the search terms neurocognition and bipolar disorder. The articles were then screened for relevance on the title and abstract. The ones that were more recent were included in the review on the understanding that they would include the previous articles. Search for Indian literature using the same search terms returned about 30 articles, most of which have been included in this guideline. Weightage was given to meta-analysis where available. The manuscript has been organised in a manner that would provide good flow for the reader, including what is the evidence available including social cognition, what assessments are possible, time taken for each assessment, what are the treatment options investigated and which of these are feasible in clinical practice. A flow chart is incorporated to highlight the same. COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BD – EVIDENCE SO FAR To understand cognition in BD, let us try to answer a few questions that commonly arise when we talk about cognition in this group of patients. Are cognitive deficits present in BD? Many studies have supplemented the clinical observation that not all BD patients have cognitive deficits. Three distinct cognitive subgroups have been identified in BD subjects in remission – those with intact cognition, those with selective cognitive impairment, and those with global cognitive impairment (Burdick, 2014; Lima, 2019).[7,8] These differences remained over a 5-year longitudinal course, thereby further highlighting that cognitive deficits in BD could represent a significantly heterogeneous group (Elhrich, 2022)[9] and the cognition remained intact in the high-performance group relative to healthy subjects. Cognitive heterogeneity is now being increasingly recognized, and the cognitive trajectory of BD is a subject of scholastic debate and enquiry (Van Rheenan, 2020).[10] Despite this, there is a consensus that not only the performance on neurocognitive tasks in nearly every major domain is disrupted during manic, depressed, or mixed phases of BD but also the deficits persist even in euthymia. Studies have noted that in euthymic BD, domain-specific deficits have been demonstrated in attention, verbal learning memory, and executive functions.[11] Attention is a complex neurocognitive domain with several subcomponents and is essential to all higher cognitive functions. Sustained attention is impaired in BD in all phases of the illness, and these impairments do not remit completely during euthymia. Selective attention deficits present in the acute episodes also persist during euthymia.[12] Verbal immediate and delayed recall is also impaired in remitted BD. Executive function deficits are the most consistent neurocognitive deficit reported in euthymic BD in different aspects of executive function like planning, set-shifting, cognitive control, and verbal fluency.[12–14] In summary, multiple investigations have consistently provided evidence of neurocognitive deficits in individuals with BD across all clinical stages, including euthymia. These impairments have been found to have moderate to high effect sizes. Deficits in verbal memory and certain aspects of executive functioning seem to be more pronounced compared to other cognitive domains. The findings of various studies are summarized below [Table 1].Table 1: Summary of studies on cognitive deficits in BDAt what stages are cognitive deficits noted? At what stage in the course of the illness do cognitive deficits occur, does illness progression has an impact on the progression of the cognitive deficits, and what is the potential for intervention at each stage are some questions that are of clinical relevance. Some studies (individual and reviews/meta-analyses) have evaluated cognitive deficits in the different stages of BD and the correlation between illness progression and the progression of cognitive deficits. The individual studies are mostly cross-sectional though longitudinal studies would be more informative. Most of these studies have reported that cognitive deficits are present from the very early stages, that is, even in the first-degree unaffected family members also, and these are more pronounced after the onset of the first episode. A recent study by Reddy et al., 2023 done at NIMHANS also showed similar results.[19] A study done at NIMHANS[20] that evaluated cognition across stages of BD also noted that those with a higher number of episodes, especially more than three manic episodes, show higher deficits than those with one or two episodes. Some of these studies are summarized below [Table 2].Table 2: Summary of studies on cognitive deficits across stages of BDAre there distinct cognitive subgroups of BD? Some of the studies have attempted to investigate this question. Bora (2018) examined the impact of a history of psychotic characteristics and full manic episodes on neurocognitive performance. The results showed that those with a history of psychotic symptoms and individuals with a history of full manic episodes, that is, BD-I, had slightly more severe cognitive deficits. BD-I significantly underperformed BD-II in global cognition, verbal memory, and processing speed. Psychotic BD was associated with significantly impaired cognition in global cognition verbal memory processing speed, EF speed, EF accuracy, working memory, and social cognition.[26] Studies have also attempted to see the difference between BD I and BD II, and they reported similar cognitive profiles. A recent systematic review reported similar cognitive profiles in BD I and BD II.[27] Lima et al.in 2019 did a hierarchical cluster analysis to investigate the presence of discrete neurocognitive subgroups using a neurocognitive battery as the basis for classification. The Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment (COBRA) and Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) were employed to evaluate self-reported cognitive challenges and the extent of functional impairment. The study delineated three distinct subgroups: The first comprised individuals with normal cognitive function (43.5%), the second included individuals with specific cognitive impairments (33.3%), and the third encompassed individuals with overall cognitive impairments (23.3%). The intact group had significantly greater levels of schooling and higher estimated IQ compared to both the generally and selectively affected groupings. Furthermore, they received a diagnosis of BD at an earlier age and underwent their initial hospitalization at a younger age than individuals with general cognitive impairment. Evidence supports the presence of a spectrum of severity ranging from patients without any impairment to those with significant cognitive dysfunction. Patients in the intact group exhibit a greater level of cognitive reserve compared to the other two groups. Nevertheless, they also encountered cognitive grievances and a certain level of functional debilitation.[8] These findings indicate that it is crucial to utilize a combination of tools, such as objective and subjective cognitive measures along with functioning instruments, in order to fully evaluate patients with BD. The above studies suggest that we definitely need a better understanding of the determinants of cognitive deficits in BD patients. Let us discuss these determinants in further detail.DETERMINANTS OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BDASSESSMENT OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS The assessment of cognitive deficits can be outlined in two steps: Screening for cognitive deficits Evaluation of cognitive deficits Like schizophrenia, where researchers have developed cognitive batteries like the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), researchers working on cognition in BD have developed screening tools that can identify cognitive deficits in BD. Before we screen the patient for cognitive deficits, assessment of the baseline IQ is very important. Screen patients when they are in remission (currently euthymic). Clinicians can use the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence® - Second Edition (WASI®-II) to assess the IQ. The WASI is intended to provide estimates of verbal and performance intelligence consistent with previous Wechsler tests in addition to measuring general, or full scale, intelligence.[36] The screening tools that have been validated for use in BD are listed below [Table 3].Table 3: Screening Tools for Cognitive Deficits in Bipolar DisorderAmong the computer-based tests, THINC-IT takes less time (15 minutes) when compared to ICAT (35 min), but THINC-IT is validated only for bipolar depression and has poor psychometric quality, so ICAT is a better screening instrument. Among the paper–pencil screening tests, COBRA takes 10 minutes and is a self-report-based test, whereas SCIP takes 15 minutes is a clinician-assessed, performance-based tool. The International Society of Bipolar Disorder (ISBD) formulated a task force to develop a consensus statement about the neurocognitive deficits in BD. This team reviewed various available cognitive batteries and the individual domain tests for their utility in BD.[41] ISBD Battery for Assessment of Neurocognition (ISBD-BANC) outlines the cognitive domains and neuropsychological tests relevant to BD. The NIMHANS neuropsychological battery which is validated for use in the Indian population has tests that can be used to assess the same cognitive domains [Table 4].Table 4: Proposed Cognitive Battery for Bipolar DisorderOut of the other cognitive batteries that could be relevant in BD but warrant further studies include: Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT) for testing inhibitory control, Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery intradimensional ⁄ extradimensional (CANTAB-IDED) set-shifting task, Tower of London (and variants) for planning, inhibition, and working memory, Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) for decision-making/risk-taking, and Theory of Mind Advanced Test for Theory of Mind. Keefe et al. group also working on cognition in BD adopted the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BAC-S) scale for assessing cognition in BD and called it Brief Assessment of Cognition in Affective Disorders (BAC-A). This battery has been studied extensively and validated for assessing cognition in BD patients.[42] The tests included in the BAC-A battery are as mentioned in the below table [Table 5].Table 5: BAC –A SubtestsRecommendation: If cognitive impairment is suspected during clinical evaluation, initially screen and/or monitor the patient's cognitive performance using one of four instruments (THINC-it, ICAT, COBRA, and SCIP). If deficits are identified, then we can proceed to the next level of assessment, choosing between BAC-A and ISBD-BANC [Figure 1].Figure 1: Algorithm for the type of tests to be used for screening and assessing cognitive deficits in BDBAC-A takes 45 minutes, clinician-assessed, performance-based tests, and ISBD-BANC takes around 90 minutes, clinician-assessed, performance-based tests. Since BAC-A assesses a component of affective memory and emotional inhibition, also takes lesser time, it might be more feasible in clinical settings. SOCIAL COGNITION IN BIPOLAR DISORDER Social cognition (SC) is a discipline that seeks to understand how brain function facilitates the cognitive processes that underlie social behavior. It encompasses a range of intricate processes that enable us to engage in adaptive social interactions. These processes include representing internal bodily states, self and other knowledge, interpersonal motivations, and the ability to respond appropriately to socioemotional information.[43] The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has categorized five fundamental areas within this concept: Theory of Mind (ToM), Social Perception, Social Knowledge, Attribution Bias, and Emotion Processing (EP).[44] The theory of mind pertains to the capacity to comprehend and assign mental states, including beliefs, wants, and intentions, to oneself and others. Mentalizing talents are also referred to as the capacity for understanding and attributing meaning to mental processes in oneself and others. Attributional bias refers to the inclination to attribute the reason for occurrences to oneself, others, or the situation to understand social events and interactions. Emotional processing refers to the cognitive and psychological mechanisms involved in understanding and managing emotions. Emotional intelligence is the capacity to accurately observe and interpret facial expressions that convey emotions, as well as effectively utilize and regulate one's own emotions. Social perception refers to the process by which individuals interpret and understand the behavior, intentions, and characteristics of others in social situations. Social competence refers to the capacity to recognize, assess, and effectively utilize social cues to make accurate assessments about social roles, norms, connections, and the circumstances of others. Social knowledge, also known as social schema, is the understanding of the rules, objectives, and roles that define social circumstances and facilitate social interactions. Patients with euthymic BD experience a decline in ToM function, particularly in verbal ToM. Regarding ToM abilities in individuals with BD, there is a widespread observation of impairment during the acute periods of the illness.[45,46] However, the evidence of abnormalities in remission samples has been less compelling. The study of sociocognitive impairment in euthymic states is highly significant since these deficiencies can significantly hinder social reintegration and rehabilitation.[47] Considering the significance and influence of ToM performance on various aspects of life such as quality of life, social perception, and social behavior, it is crucial to conduct additional research on the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms behind these impairments. This research is necessary to identify specific areas to focus on in the development of personalized SC training for this particular population. A study conducted by Choudhary et al. in 2021[48] indicates that individuals with BD exhibit the lowest performance, while the HC (healthy controls) demonstrate the highest performance on the majority of SC (social cognition) tasks. Siblings, conversely, occupy an intermediate position between the patients and healthy controls for performance on all social cognition subtests, with the exception of the faux pas composite index and externalising bias, where siblings exhibited inferior performance compared to the patient group. Within the several areas of SC, the faux pas index, which reflects deficiencies in ToM, could potentially be explored as a potential endophenotype for BD. However, it is essential to replicate these findings with a larger sample size, undertake normalcy assessments for task performances, and analyze biomarkers to draw definitive conclusions from these results. In the overall population of patients with BD, there is no association between SC and demographic and clinical factors. Nevertheless, SC exhibits a notable correlation with neurocognition in both patients and siblings of patients with BD. Figure 2 presents the algorithm of approach to cognitive evaluation for BD patients.Figure 2: Algorithm of approach to cognitive evaluation in BD patientsMANAGEMENT OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN BD Cognitive dysfunction has been linked to psychosocial dysfunction and reduced quality of life in individuals with BD. Secondary expenses associated with BD (such as unemployment and reduced workplace efficiency) present a significantly larger economic burden. There is a pressing need for procognitive treatment to enhance the functioning and quality of life in individuals with cognitive impairment in BD.[49] Below, we present the evidence from various trials that have looked at pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions [Tables 6 and 7, respectively].Table 6: Summary of pharmacological intervention study details and resultsTable 7: Summary Psychosocial and Other Biological Intervention Study Details and ResultsTo summarize the above findings at present, no intervention has shown strong, separate, and beneficial effects on cognitive function in adults with BD, as indicated by findings from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigations. It is recommended to consider methodological concerns such as enriching the study population with persons who have pretreatment cognitive impairment and include those who are in remission. The field must also determine a cognitive measure that is thorough, with a little impact from repeated practice, and is capable of detecting changes as a dependent measure. Since we do not have any agent or therapy that can improve or reverse cognitive deficits in BD, it becomes important that we focus on intervening before these deficits set in, that is, the prevention of cognitive impairment. This can be done first by identifying the mediators of the cognitive impairments and second by intervening early. The mediators of cognitive deficits of BD are educational attainment and premorbid intelligence quotient (proxy variables of cognitive reserve), clinical symptomatology (remission vs acute episode), subclinical depressive symptoms, psychotic symptoms, bipolar diagnostic subtype, psychiatric or medical comorbidity, illness duration (chronicity), number of episodes, pharmacological treatment, and childhood adversity. The potential prevention strategies would be to prevent multiple episodes with effective pharmacotherapy and the implementation of psychoeducation programs, avoid concomitant medications that interfere with cognitive function, treat subclinical depressive symptoms, control comorbidity (mental and psychiatric), promote healthy habits and aerobic physical exercise, implement cognitive or functional remediation, prescribe adjunctive procognitive treatment, and use noninvasive brain stimulation techniques (TMS, tDCS) wherever indicated, early in the course of the illness, that is, after the first episode.[69] APPLICATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE Early interventions in bd The early interventions can again be divided into two, one in the people who have developed the illness and are in the early course and second in those who are at high risk of developing BD. In BD patients in the early course of illness, the ISBD task force has given certain recommendations after a detailed systematic review. They recommend that the combination of psychological and pharmaceutical interventions may provide synergistic effects, although the most effective interventions or combinations for this specific group in the early stages are yet uncertain. They also suggest considering the potential benefits of lithium in reducing relapses in the early stages of illness, along with the data supporting the use of both medication and psychoeducation; it is important to assess the effectiveness of combining lithium and psychoeducation therapies in the early stages of illness. Based on the available evidence supporting the use of both medication and psychological treatments, individuals in the early stages of BD should be provided with the opportunity to receive safe and effective interventions.[70] Another systematic review that evaluated the efficacy of early intervention in high-risk individuals (with an affected FDR) concluded that existing studies provide limited data regarding the conversion to BD, which is the primary outcome measure in early intervention research. Conducting multicenter, prospective randomized studies with large sample numbers, confirmed familial risk, and a homogeneous group of participants would provide valuable insights into the impact of a single intervention. Several therapies with documented efficacy in treating mood episodes, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, atypical antipsychotics, and moderate physical exercise, should be considered for implementation in this particular population. It is important to carefully assess the ethical implications of providing antipsychotics to a high-risk group. Early intervention in the initial phases of a problem can help avoid the long-term impact of the disease and yield significant advantages in terms of both human wellbeing and economic considerations and will greatly contribute to the prevention onset of BD.[71] SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Many individuals with BD exhibit measurable cognitive impairment in all clinical phases, including euthymia, even after accounting for potential confounding factors such as demographic characteristics, drug effects, and residual depressed symptoms. This cognitive impairment affects all domains, although it is especially pronounced in verbal memory and executive functioning. Several studies provide evidence suggesting that lithium treatment has a slight detrimental effect on cognitive performance in a certain subset of people with BD who do not respond well to the medication. Valproate is linked to poorer cognitive function in comparison to other drugs used to stabilize mood, although the effect of second-generation antipsychotics on cognition is still uncertain. Existing research indicates that, in contrast to individuals with schizophrenia, the majority of people with BD exhibit cognitive abilities that are average or higher than normal prior to the onset of the disorder. Nevertheless, a portion of individuals with BD has below-average premorbid intellectual ability, suggesting that early neurodevelopmental issues may contribute to the development of BD in this specific group of patients. The available prospective studies do not provide evidence to support the notion of gradual cognitive loss in BD after the initial episode. In contrast, certain research indicates that patients may observe enhancements in cognitive performance through suitable treatment following the initial manic episode. Cognitive functioning plays a crucial role in predicting how well people with BD can do their everyday activities and work. Initial results from limited studies have indicated the potential cognitive-enhancing effects of behavioral interventions (cognitive remediation) as well as pharmacological interventions (erythropoietin, intranasal insulin, lurasidone, and mifepristone) and neurostimulation interventions (rTMS and tDCS). Conducting longitudinal studies on the neurocognitive functioning of individuals at high risk of BD can enhance our understanding of how neurocognitive impairment develops and progresses in BD. This knowledge can then be used to develop specific early intervention strategies that aim to prevent or slow down and potentially reverse cognitive decline. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant influence that cognitive abilities have on the overall functioning of individuals with BD. Therefore, future efficacy trials should also prioritize investigating the possible positive and negative effects of therapies on cognitive performance and functional outcomes.

      "abstract": "Neuroplasticity is characterized by the brain's ability to change its activity in response to extrinsic and intrinsic factors and is thought to be the mechanism behind all brain functions. Neuroplasticity causes structural and functional changes on a molecular level, specifically the growth of different regions in the brain and changes in synaptic and post-synaptic activities. The four types of neuroplasticity are homologous area adaption, compensatory masquerade, cross-modal reassignment, and map expansion. All of these help the brain work around injuries or new information inputs. In addition to baseline physical functions, neuroplasticity is thought to be the basis of emotional and mental regulations and the impairment of it can cause various mental illnesses. Concurrently, these mental illnesses further the damage of synaptic plasticity in the brain. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental illnesses. It is affected by and accelerates the impairment of neuroplasticity. It is characterized by a chronically depressed state of mind that can impact the patient's daily life, including work life and interests. This review will focus on highlighting the physiological aspects of the disease and the role of neuroplasticity in the pathogenesis and pathology of the disorder. Moreover, the role of monoamine regulation and ketamine uptake will be discussed in terms of their antidepressant effects on the outcomes of MDD.",

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

      "abstract": "A major barrier to advances in the field of mild traumatic brain injury assessment and treatment has been the continuous efforts to dichotomize causal factors. Mild traumatic brain injury in general and concussion in athletes in particular, offer a unique testing ground for hypotheses related to the interaction of psychological and biological variables. Most practicing clinical neuropsychologists recognize that the majority of individuals with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury recover quickly with minimal or conservative interventions. Athletes experiencing concussion often voice uncertainty regarding their health and their career. The very nature of concussion symptoms can be quite alarming and raise anxiety about threats to life or, at least, the quality of life. Symptoms comprising the post concussion syndrome are generally grouped into those of a physical, cognitive or psychological nature. The prevalence of persisting symptomatology in these three conditions is remarkably similar.",

      "abstract": "Hoover’s sign has long been used to support a clinical diagnosis of functional weakness. However, it also occurs in people with pain, other functional disorders and functional neurological disorder without weakness. Some of its clinical characteristics, such as being more prominent with visual attention, suggest it might be reframed as a sign of agency. The experience, reflections and awareness of people with an abnormal Hoover’s sign can be seen in this context. Reframing Hoover’s sign by linking it to agency, and extending it to other clinical scenarios, could help clinicians and, most importantly, patients. Hoover’s sign has long been used to support a clinical diagnosis of functional weakness. This does not explain why it can be found in pain, other functional disorders and functional neurological disorder without weakness. It can be reframed as a sign of agency by looking at clinical nuggets like Hoover’s in structural changes in the brain and other disorders and clinical characteristics, like it being more prominent with visual attention. The clinical experience of people with an abnormal Hoover’s sign and their reflections and awareness can be seen in this context. A recently discovered clinical technique of inducing it briefly in healthy people with pressure on the patella or tonic vibration is discussed. This illustrates the importance of sensory processing (especially sensory attenuation and proprioception) and learning/habituation to stimuli, which is known to be altered in functional neurological disorder and other functional disorders. Reframing Hoover’s sign by linking it to agency and extending it to other clinical scenarios could help clinicians, neuroscience and, most importantly, patients.",

Des alterations rythmiques sont egalement mises en evidence sur des tâches de perception de rythme (i.e., sur des tâches n’impliquant pas de production motrice). Face a l’etendue des dysfonctionnements rythmiques dans la MP, l’hypothese d’une dysrythmie generalisee a ete formulee. Cette hypothese implique que l’ensemble des alterations rythmiques qui s’observent au travers de diverses tâches et dans differents systemes effecteurs partage des mecanismes causaux communs. Neanmoins, cette proposition n’a pas ete confirmee a ce jour, et nombre de questions demeurent, tant sur le plan theorique que clinique : les deficits rythmiques caracteristiques de la MP sont-ils reellement lies ? Une source commune aux manifestations rythmiques deficitaires est-elle envisageable ? Si tel est le cas, quels en sont les correlats cerebraux, et les retombees cliniques ? Elaboree autour de deux principaux axes de recherche, cette dissertation avait pour objectif principal de tester l’hypothese d’une dysrythmie generalisee dans la MP, au travers de deux questions : i) existe-t-il des liens entre trois domaines de production rythmique (i.e., coordinations oro-faciale, manuelle, et de marche) et un domaine perceptif dans la MP ?; et ii) quel est l’impact d’un entrainement rythmique d’un domaine moteur (i.e., coordination rythmique manuelle) sur d’autres domaines de coordination motrice (i.e., oro-faciales et de la marche) ? L’ensemble des resultats confirme l’hypothese d’une dysrythmie generalisee dans la MP, et l’existence tres probable d’alterations de mecanismes en lien avec une fonction predictive generale qui, lorsqu’elle est la cible d’un entrainement rythmique, pourrait permettre de reduire certains troubles moteurs dans la MP.",

The doctor requires knowledge, skill, and most of all experience, but can improve the chances of a correct diagnosis and appropriate management by careful history taking, examination, and observation. This is one area in which expensive investigations are difficult to perform and frequently unhelpful. The challenges are:\n\n\n\nAlthough “confused” or confusional state are convenient descriptions to apply to a patient, they do not have a precise medical meaning and are best avoided as diagnostic terms. The term delirium is much better defined and accepted in the classification of mental disorders. It has been defined as: “an aetiologically non-specific organic cerebral syndrome, characterised by concurrent disturbances of consciousness and attention, perception, thinking, memory, psychomotor behaviour, emotion and the sleep-wake cycle”.\n\nAn apparently “confused” patient may have an alternative diagnosis such as dysphasia, dementia or psychiatric disorder.\n\nDelirium, as defined above, includes a range of different behaviours and may be subdivided into hyperactive or agitated delirium, and hypoactive or quiet delirium. The same patient can have both or neither subtype.\n\nDelirium tremens is a specific term for the confusional state caused by withdrawal of alcohol.\n\nThe prevalence and incidence of delirium depend on the population studied. Prevalence in hospital ranges from 10–20% in medical wards and could become higher as the elderly population in hospital increases. The incidence during hospitalisation ranges from 4–30%, again depending on the population studied. About 25% of people over 70 years old admitted to hospital have delirium.\n\nThe history and examination should be directed to look at …",

Such memory disturbances are usually non-specific, involving several stages of memory, and are overshadowed by other clinical features.

The alteration of consciousness during epileptic seizures is discussed with respect to these findings: Alterations of consciousness during epileptic seizures may be produced by subcortical, i.e., reticular formation, and/or cortical dysfunction followed by excessive, hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. An impairment of consciousness during absence seizures may be due mainly to cortical dysfunction; during complex partial seizures (CPS), it may be due to dysfunctional subcortical neuronal structures. The mechanisms underlying an alteration of consciousness are defined as causing “irritative” functional disturbances and/or as having “inhibitory” effects on consciousness‐related structures.",

The Shy-Drager syndrome (idiopathic orthostatic hypotension associated with diverse signs of involvement of the central nervous system) must not, however, be considered as an independent form of disease.

El dano neuronal y el deficit neurologico asociado a isquemia cerebral no detectada clinicamente, puede reducirse considerablemente al aplicar ciertos procedimientos de neuromonitorizacion. Los monitores actuales tienen varias aplicaciones, dependiendo del objetivo final para el cual se aplican (Cuadro I) y actualmente, al EEG se le considera como estandar sobre el cual se hacen muchas comparaciones. Este monitor permite evaluar el estado funcional del SNC asi como el efecto farmacodinamico de los farmacos anestesicos. Se acepta ampliamente que el EEG es altamente sensitivo e indicador de isquemia o hipoxia del SNC, y con este proposito se le ha utilizado desde su introduccion en la clinica. Sin embargo, su aplicacion practica en la cirugia intracraneal, es dificil debido a que se requiere una gran cantidad de electrodos para evaluar ambos hemisferios cerebrales en todas sus regiones y la colocacion de los mismos interfiere con las maniobras del cirujano. Es por eso que el uso rutinario de este monitor no siempre es posible en la practica. El monitoreo electroencefalografico para el efecto de los farmacos anestesicos, tiene tres aplicaciones: a) una herramienta cuantitativa para el estudio farmacologico de agentes activos en el SNC; b) la valoracion del efecto supresivo metabolico (control de la dosis del tiopental para coma barbiturico, por ejemplo) y c) la evaluacion de la supresion funcional del SNC (anestesia e hipnosis). La eleccion de la variable fisiologica contra la cual correlacionar el EEG es critica. La primera observacion fue la de comparar el efecto de la estimulacion nociva con el efecto en el EEG. El grado de depresion del EEG antes de la laringoscopia se correlaciona con la magnitud de los camCuadro I. Tipos de monitores.",

The criterion is that the individual has a maladaptive reaction to a somatic symptom. In DSM-5 the terms somatisation disorder, pain disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder have been discarded, whereas factitious disorder as well as psychological factors affecting other medical conditions have been added to somatic symptom disorder and other disorders. Conversion disorder remains as it was in DSM-IV. Hypochondriasis has been renamed 'illness anxiety disorder'.The new description of somatic symptom disorder in DSM-5 represents a big step forwards, because the decision has been made to use, for classification, a positive criterion, namely maladaptive reaction to a somatic symptom, instead of the earlier negative criterion, namely that the symptoms should be medically unexplained. Before attaching the ssd label to an illness, the clinician will have to weigh up the clinical consequences of this psychiatric diagnosis.",

Amongst the reasons for this are high rates of co-occurrence of different diagnostic constructs, which themselves are often polythetic in nature.

These diagnostic constructs rely on people meeting the diagnostic criteria having similar qualities to their condition such as similar likelihoods of outcomes/responses to treatments. These highly variable clinical pictures are seen even when clear disease is involved, such as the dementias. General medical diagnostic constructs can also display highly variable clinical pictures even when clear disease processes have been identified. Polythetic diagnostic criteria decided upon by expert committees are also used for general medical diagnostic constructs which can also result in people meeting the same diagnostic criteria having little in common in their clinical pictures. Co-occurrence is also common in general medicine. Psychological formulation does not have to address the issue of variable clinical pictures. Both symptom-based and dimensional classifications can depict variable clinical pictures more accurately than diagnostic constructs but there are pragmatic issues such as suitability for brief appointments or emergency work.",

These symptoms can lead the person to lose his or her job and lower the quality of life of both patients and their relatives.To review the literature on demographic, clinical, cognitive, psychiatric, occupational and social variables associated with the work situation.Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have detected variables related with unemployment. Empirical research has shown how physical disability, fatigue and the progression of the disease exert a clear influence on the patient's work situation. Yet, the same degree of evidence is not true for gender, depression, age, duration of the disease and cognitive variables. Little attention has been given to work characteristics such as job discrimination, employer's attitude, labour laws, colleagues' attitudes and transport problems.Many of the factors that determine job loss in a patient with multiple sclerosis can be identified in time to allow them to be modified or offset. The knowledge provided by the studies mentioned above makes it possible to detect patients who are at risk of losing their job so that interventions can be carried out with the aim of preventing such a situation from occurring. More particularly, the vulnerability profile includes high physical disability and fatigue, progressive development of the disease and the presence of cognitive impairment, among others.Factores asociados con la situacion laboral de pacientes con esclerosis multiple.Introduccion. La esclerosis multiple es una enfermedad neurologica desmielinizante que suele provocar trastornos motrices, perceptivos, afectivos y cognitivos a quienes la padecen. Estos sintomas pueden llevar a la persona a perder su empleo, y disminuir la calidad de vida del paciente y sus familiares. Objetivo. Revisar estudios sobre variables demograficas, clinicas, cognitivas, psiquiatricas, laborales y sociales asociadas con la situacion laboral. Desarrollo. Estudios transversales y longitudinales han detectado variables relacionadas con el desempleo. Las investigaciones empiricas muestran una influencia clara de la discapacidad fisica, la fatiga y el curso de la enfermedad sobre la situacion laboral. Sin embargo, el genero, la depresion, la edad, la duracion de la enfermedad y las variables cognitivas no poseen el mismo grado de evidencia. Caracteristicas de la ocupacion, como discriminacion laboral, actitud del empleador, leyes laborales, actitud de los compañeros de trabajo y dificultades en el transporte han sido variables poco consideradas. Conclusiones. Muchos de los factores que determinan la perdida de empleo en un paciente con esclerosis multiple pueden identificarse a tiempo para poder modificarlos o compensarlos. Los conocimientos aportados por los estudios reseñados permiten detectar a aquellos pacientes que se encuentran en riesgo de perder su empleo para realizar intervenciones posibles con el objetivo de prevenir esta situacion. En particular, el perfil de vulnerabilidad incluye alta discapacidad fisica y fatiga, curso progresivo de la enfermedad y presencia de deterioro cognitivo, entre otros.",

Among them are nonepileptic seizures, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Persian Gulf War unexplained illnesses, toxic mold and sick building syndrome, and silicone breast implant disease. Some of these illnesses may be associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, but it is not likely that these abnormalities are caused by traditionally defined neurological disease. Instead, the cognitive abnormalities may be caused by a complex interaction between biological and psychological factors. Nonepileptic seizures serve as an excellent model of medically unexplained symptoms. Although nonepileptic seizures clearly are associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, they are not of neurological origin. There is evidence that severe stressors and PTSD are associated with immune system problems, neurochemical changes, and various diseases; these data blur the distinctions between psychological and organic etiologies. Diagnostic problems are intensified by the fact that many patients are poor historians. Patients are prone to omit history of severe stressors and psychiatric problems, and the inability to talk about stressors increases the likelihood of suffering from physiological forms of stress.",

Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting. In the general population, persistent insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety or depression [2].\r\n\r\nTo effectively adjust patient needs to optimal treatment interventions, health-care professionals must be able to distinguish normal adjustment to cancer from altered reactions to the disease.

A systematic approach is recommended when physicians encounter patients who primarily present with abnormal movements. This chapter illustrates a clinical-based approach that consists of main questions that need to be addressed consecutively in order to determine the correct diagnosis. These questions are: Are the movements involuntary? What is the dominant phenomenology? Where does the abnormal movement disorder originate? What are the associated features? What is the syndrome? What is the differential diagnosis? The identification of the clinical characteristics of abnormal movements and of the associated features defines the syndromic pattern.",

      "abstract": "Any change in the social or physical environment that threatens the needs or interests of a mammal, induces a state of tension ('stress') in the animal. Driven by this tension, the animal changes its behaviour. At the same time, alterations occur in bodily functions. All organs and regulatory systems (central and peripheral nervous systems, endocrine and immune systems) participate in these behaviour-physiological response and are affected in their activities. The character of the reactions (e.g. fight, flight, passivity) is mainly determined by the animals appraisal of the environmental change and of the possible impact of its response. Aim of the reactions is neutralising the threat and gaining control over the environment (adaptation). When this is achieved, the tension recedes. In case the response is unsuccessful, the state of tension persists ('chronic stress'). Prolonged exposure of brain and/or bodily functions to stress can result in pathological states.",

      "title": "Functional gait disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional gait disorders are common in clinical practice. They are also usually disabling for affected individuals. The diagnosis is challenging because no single walking pattern is pathognomonic for a functional gait disorder. Establishing a diagnosis is based not primarily on excluding organic gait disorders but instead predominantly on recognizing positive clinical features of functional gait disorders, such as an antalgic, a buckling, or a waddling gait. However, these features can resemble and overlap with organic gait disorders. It is therefore necessary to also look for inconsistency (variations in clinical presentation that cannot be reconciled with an organic lesion) and incongruity (combination of symptoms and signs that is not seen with organic lesions). Yet, these features also have potential pitfalls as inconsistency can occur in patients with dystonic gait or those with freezing of gait. Similarly, patients with dystonia or chorea can present with bizarre gait patterns that may falsely be interpreted as incongruity. A further complicating factor is that functional and organic gait disorders may coexist within the same patient. To improve the diagnostic process, we present a sign-based approach—supported by videos—that incorporates the diverse clinical spectrum of functional gait disorders. We identify 7 groups of supportive gait signs that can signal the presence of functional gait disorders. For each group of signs, we highlight how specific clinical tests can bring out the inconsistencies and incongruencies that further point to a functional gait disorder.",

Some of the difficulties of applying this definition are examined, and a few concluding remarks are added on the \"cash value\" (in James' sense) of the concept of psychogenesis in medical practice.

During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness.

The analysis indicated that psychological pain may best be defined as a lasting, unsustainable, and unpleasant feeling resulting from negative appraisal of an inability or deficiency of the self. This negative self-appraisal is typically brought on by loss of someone or something, or failure to achieve something that is intimately linked to core psychological needs.",

These diseases may manifest at any age from birth until late adulthood with acute manifestation or as a chronic progressive disease. Virtually any organ may be impaired, but the organs with the highest energetic demands are most frequently involved, including brain, muscle, heart and liver. Some mitochondrial disorders affect a single organ (e.g., the eye in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy), but many involve multiple organ systems. Many patients display an assemblage of clinical features that can be ascribed to a discrete clinical syndrome, such as the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), neurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). On the other hand, many other mitochondrial disorders do not clearly fit into one particular and recognizable syndrome category, and the spectrum of disease phenotypes can be broadly overlapping among several syndromes. All possible inheritance patterns can be found (maternal, X linked, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and de novo occurrence) due to the dual involvement of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

This is attributed to a plethora of neuromolecular factors negatively affecting the functional make-up of the brain. The complex interplay of these factors include neuronal alterations and neuroplasticity, signalling molecular, astrocyte and glial cell alterations which together act as a survival mechanism in several brain regions.",

The output of these processes (for example, heart rate, blood pressure, hormonal rhythms, or postural sway) demonstrates complex variability that can be quantified using the concept of fractals, derived from the field of nonlinear dynamics. Complex physiological dynamics enable an organism to rapidly respond to the internal and external perturbations of everyday life. Aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity in the dynamics of many physiological systems. This loss of complexity may reduce the ability to adapt to stress and lead to the syndrome of frailty.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that persists or recurs more than three months and may extend beyond the expected time of healing. Recently, nociplastic pain has been introduced as a descriptor of the mechanism of pain, which is due to the disturbance of neural processing without actual or potential tissue damage, appearing to replace a concept of psychogenic pain. An interdisciplinary task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) compiled a systematic classification of clinical conditions associated with chronic pain, which was published in 2018 and will officially come into effect in 2022 in the 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization. ICD-11 offers the option for recording the presence of psychological or social factors in chronic pain; however, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions in the pathogenesis of chronic pain are missing. Earlier pain disorder was defined as a condition with chronic pain associated with psychological factors, but it was replaced with somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) in 2013. Recently clinical nosology is trending toward highlighting neurological pathology of chronic pain, discounting psychological or social factors in the pathogenesis of pain. This review article discusses components of the pain pathway, the component-based mechanisms of pain, central and peripheral sensitization, roles of chronic inflammation, and the involvement of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway metabolites, exploring the participation of psychosocial and behavioral factors in central sensitization of diseases progressing into the development of chronic pain, comorbid diseases that commonly present a symptom of chronic pain, and psychiatric disorders that manifest chronic pain without obvious actual or potential tissue damage.",

It is concluded that personality factors and the kind and locus of brain lesions are the most crucial determinants. The locus of the brain damage may have cumulative effects either when it is situated in a strategic place (usually within the white matter, affecting interneuronal communication) or when various types of lesions appear superimposed (combination of focal and diffuse lesions). Consequently, the consideration of the patient's personality background and of as many neuropsychological facts as possible may considerably increase the validity of outcome predictions. When static or dynamic neuroimaging fails to show abnormalities in spite of obvious psychological alterations, an intensive neuropsychological documentation may even replace neuroradiology.",

Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

Also, other symptoms such as loss of attentiveness and concentration, guilty conscience, pessimistic attitude for the future, sleeping disorder, lack of appetite, thinking of or doing a self-injury or suicidal act may characterize Depression. These Symptoms of Depression are similar to Wool-Zeng(鬱證), Zeon-Zeng(癲證), Her-ro(虛勞), Bul-Sa-Sik(不思食), Tal-Young-Sil-Zeong(脫營失精), Bul-Myeon(不眠), Ki-Myeon(嗜眠) in Oriental Medicine. In general, Depression is classified into Wool-Zeng type and Zeon-Zeng type. The former is similar to the neurotic type of depression, the latter is similar to the psychopathic type of depression. The clear causes of Depression are not known yet. But psychodynamic and biological factors are assumed to cause Depression. Psychodynamic factors may correspond to Chil-Zeong(七情) and biological factors to Tae-Byeong(胎病) and Dam(痰) in Oriental medicine. In Occidental medicine, Depression is treated by psychotherapy and medication. Electrically-induced spasm therapy and phototherapy also used for the treatment of Depression. In Oriental medicine, Depression is treated by more various therapy such as herb medication, acupuncture and moxibustion, oriental psychotherapy and dirigation(Gi-Gong, 氣功).

The differential diagnosis of patients with medically unexplainable symptoms includes conversion disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and illness anxiety disorder among others. Conversion disorder is a mental disorder with pseudo-neurological symptoms that are not due to an organic abnormality. For its diagnosis it is necessary to show that the symptoms and findings are not compatible with neurological diseases. Conversion disorder and any neurological diseases can coexist, in which cases neurologists and psychiatrists should cooperate when treating the patient. However, it is difficult to clearly distinguish individual symptoms by their mechanism. Patients complaining of physical symptoms, including those with conversion disorder, require careful explanation that takes into account the patient's explanatory model. Clinicians must switch from an acute disease model to a chronic disease model. These patients are more likely to concentrate consciously on their physical condition and clinicians should help patients avoid ruminating on their physical symptoms. Because it is not simple to completely exclude physical disorders and prove that the symptoms are psychogenic, confirming a diagnosis should be performed carefully.",

Bij kinderen met CP kunnen problemen op het gebied van visuele waarneming in het oog en/of in de hersenen gelokaliseerd zijn. Oculaire Visuele Inperking (OVI) heeft betrekking op die vormen van slechtziendheid welke samenhangen met oogheelkundige aandoeningen. Cerebrale Visuele Inperking (CVI) kan omschreven worden als een visuele stoornis als gevolg van al dan niet aantoonbare schade aan een of meerdere hersengebieden na het chiasma opticum of aan slechtziendheid waar geen oculaire verklaring voor bestaat. CVI kan veroorzaakt worden door het hypoxische-ischemisch letsel. Daarnaast kunnen prematuriteit, hydrocefalus, epilepsie en beschadigingen aan het centraal zenuwstel, CVI tot gevolg hebben. De klinische symptomen van CVI kunnen zich manifesteren in onder andere visueel sensorische symptomen, oculomotorische symptomen en hogere visuele symptomen. Een ander opvallend kenmerk is verminderde gezichtsscherpte zonder oogheelkundige verklaring. CVI kan samengaan met oogheelkundige afwijkingen zoals strabismus, optische atrofie en nystagmus. Daarnaast doen visuele problemen zich met name voor op het gebied van de hogere cognitieve processen als herkenning, orientatie, diepte-perceptie, gelijktijdige perceptie van beweging en visuele waarneming. Kinderen met CVI kunnen bijvoorbeeld moeite hebben met het vinden van de looproutes en de overgang van licht naar donker. Als gevolg van CVI kunnen functioneringsproblemen in het dagelijks leven ontstaan maar ook problemen in het gedrag en motorische ontwikkeling van kinderen. Deze problemen kunnen op verschillende manieren tot uiting komen omdat CVI samen kan voorkomen met andere problemen, zoals gedragsproblemen, epilepsie of problemen op het gebied van aandacht en concentratie.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia or pseudo fibromyalgia? - We have to get it right",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, repetitive strain injury and myofascial pain syndromes are no more considered as ‘waste basket diagnosis’, especially because of better biological understanding of these disorders including their immunological and genetic links.1-3 Patients truly suffering from these illnesses, therefore, need to be recognised correctly. Missing these peculiar illnesses and thereby messing them up by misdiagnosing as more serious ailments like Rheumatoid arthritis, other arthritic conditions, connective tissue diseases, psychiatric illnesses or malingering are expensive errors. An equally expensive error is labelling these close mimics and other pseudo fibromyalgia states as fibromyalgia. In both the scenarios, implications can be clinical (progression of an undiagnosed illness), pharmacological (toxicity of an unwarranted drug therapy) economic, emotional, social or even legal. Unfortunately, these errors are made by General practitioners, Physicians, orthopedicians, Psychiatrists and by Rheumatologists alike.4 Syndromic approach to diagnosis of illnesses relies upon physical signs and investigations to a large extent. In pain disorders like fibromyalgia, however, the vague, ‘out of proportion’ tenderness on minor pressure or even a gentle touch may be the only other notable feature apart from the widespread aches complained by the patient. There is no ‘tell-tale’ sign elicitable by inspection, palpation, percussion or auscultation for this spectrum of illnesses. Laboratory investigations always draw a blank. Chronic pain disorders, therefore, cannot be diagnosed by this conventional approach.5 Although chronic wide spread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and mental fogging are some of the hallmarks of these illnesses, familiarity with classification criteria is a prerequisite to identify a good number of them. There are patients, however, with these illnesses that do not fulfill any criteria. Neurochemical misbalances, rather than anatomical lesions are more likely to cause these disorders; nor are they straightforward psychiatric illnesses, in spite of many reports of mind-body link in these conditions.6, 7 While rheumatology clinics in the western and developed world are flooded with such patients and rheumatologists in those parts of the world are more familiar with these illnesses, developing world is less familiar with these maladies. Now that the epidemic seems to be reaching the less developed world, many unanswered questions need to be addressed on this subject. Is it globalization that is bringing it to the developing world, where people earlier could tolerate small aches and pains better? Is it much less common amongst the underprivileged section of the society? Do lifestyle, dietary factors and other socioeconomic factors have some influence on pain threshold, if not on causation of these new world diseases? Painful disorders with anatomical lesions like inflammatory arthropathies, connective tissue diseases and osteoarthritis may also cause vicious cycle of ‘pain begetting more pain’, which may be termed as secondary fibromyalgia.8 On the contrary and paradoxically enough, there is a paradigm shift in the understanding of pain disorders; it is now believed widely that pain itself can cause localised inflammation in a significant proportion of cases and thereby induces this novel mechanism to perpetuate the vicious cycle of pain.9 Whether this has a therapeutic implication is arguable, but breaking this cycle is important in arresting the pain process. Mimics of fibromyalgia comprise a wide spectrum. On the one end, there are highly treatable low grade metabolic disorders like hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency causing chronic widespread pain. These relatively common disorders need to be excluded or diagnosed and treated, as the case may be, in a chronic pain scenario.10 On the other end of this spectrum, there are more serious organic pathologies like enthesopathic pain of spondyloarthropathies and at times, out of proportion pain and tenderness of leukemic arthropathies, especially in children presenting as vague aches and pains. Attending physician need to be sensitized to avoid misdiagnosing these conditions as fibromyalgia. Last, but not the least, undiagnosed cases of psychiatric illnesses including depression and malin-gering for social, emotional or economic gains can also present as ‘pseudofibromyalgia’.11, 12 The Chinese study in this issue by Rong MU et al. has revealed poor awareness and deficiency in diagnostic skills amongst doctors including rheumatologists and is a must- read article for all. Some of the points discussed in the preceding paragraphs are realised in this paper. Many rheumatologists who considered themselves non-believers of this vague entity in the recent past, have now turned into believers in view of emerging evidences cited above. No rheumatologist can afford to make a mistake today in diagnosing or excluding these modern day illnesses.",

The actual burden of mental disorders in older adults is probably underestimated because the stigma associated with mental disorders results in under-reporting of symptoms by older adults, under-diagnosis by healthcare providers, clinical significance of sub-threshold symptoms, and underrepresentation in epidemiological studies of high-risk older adults. Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

The diagnosis of such disorders is complex due to the fact that they may appear as medical conditions. Hence, most of somatoform patients do not seek psychiatric assistance. The common feature of somatoform disorders as described in DSM-IV-TR is the presence of physical symptoms suggesting an underlying medical condition that is either not found or does not account for the level of functional impairment. The diagnostic criteria for the somatoform disorders were established for adults and are applied to children for lack of child-specific research base and a developmentally appropriate alternative system. The most common somatoform disorders in children and adolescents are recurrent abdominal pain and tension headache. Other disorders in the category include: somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, conversion disorder, hypochondriasis and body dysmorphic disorder Treatment is applied through a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. SSRI'S are effective in somatoform disorders that have co-morbidity with anxiety and depression as well as in body dysmorphic disorder and hypochondriasis. Conversion disorder is usually treated with benzodiazepines and pain disorder with light analgesics, tricyclics and tegretol. In terms of psychotherapy, treatments most effective for somatoform disorders have been found to be cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback.",

However, CPRS may also develop spontaneously. CRPS is clinically characterized by sensory (pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia), autonomic (disturbances of skin temperature, color change, and presence of sweating abnormalities), and motor (paresis, tremor, and dystonia) disturbances. There have been growing evidences for that CRPS is a systemic disease involving the CNS and peripheral nervous system. The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms and signs, so that it could be under- or over-diagnosed. However, careful clinical evaluation and additional tests should lead to an adequate diagnosis. The goal of treatment is to improve functions, relieve pain, and achieve remission. The early diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatments, which include pain management, rehabilitation, and psychological therapy, are the most important elements for solving the patients' problems.",

Then, the information is conveyed to the brain through the spinothalamic tract that projects to the thalamus, insula, SII and other areas. In clinical situations, a dysfunction of this nociceptive system explains chronic pain that can be simply classified into 3 subtypes according to pathophysiological mechanisms. Case 1: the nociceptive system is functioning normally, and provides (appropriately) a pain message that informs the brain of a local inflammation, or cancer, or infection... This is the situation of chronic pain because of an excess of nociception. Case 2: there is a (past or present) lesion of the nervous system that induces a dysfunction in the pain system. This is the neuropathic pain. Case 3: between the two former cases, there is no evidence for a lesion in the nociceptive system, and there are no evidences for lesion at the peripheral level, but there are evidences of dysregulation(s). These are the cases of dysfunctional pain.",

Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Catatonia, a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by abnormal speech, volition, and movement, is primarily thought of as a symptom of a primary psychiatric pathology, but there are a variety of non-psychiatric medical conditions that must be considered. As a result of symptomatic complexity and the wide range of differential diagnoses, catatonia-like symptoms can cloud the clinical evaluation and complicate treatment regimens. Within the realm of catatonic-like diagnoses is functional neurological disorder because of its vast range of potential presentations. Functional neurologic disorder can be diagnosed by evidence of incompatibility between neurologic symptoms and recognized neurological or medical conditions. Clinical uncertainty is further intensified in the presence of co-morbid medical etiologies because of inability to neatly delegate symptoms to a specific diagnosis. The blurred spectrum between catatonia and functional neurologic disorder is highlighted in this patient’s complex clinical presentation while being further obscured in the setting of a possible overlying encephalitis exacerbating the presentation. This case report presents a unique case of a Marine recruit whose inconsistent catatonic symptoms caused diagnostic uncertainty and were ultimately decided to have neurologic and psychiatric contributions, highlighting that diagnoses are not mutually exclusive and should be continually re-assessed as new data become available. This report also showcases the distinctiveness of U.S. Marine culture and possible physical manifestations because of imposed psychological stress.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

La connaissance de particularités sensorielles, sensori-motrices et cognitives est insuffisamment répandue. Pourtant, les arborescences de symptômes singulières pour chaque personne autiste deviennent familières à ses accompagnants proches (parents et professionnels). Mais tous se trouvent conjoncturellement démunis par des troubles du comportement : – soit parce que les symptômes de l’autisme sont amplifiés ou modifiés ; – soit parce que des syndromes psychiatriques s’ajoutent à l’autisme ; – soit parce que des maladies du corps sont associées à l’autisme (génétiques ou neurologiques) et ont aussi une expression psychique et comportementale. Ces différentes causes sont souvent confondues dans les services, d’autant plus qu’elles peuvent interférer. Or les traitements ne sont pas les mêmes, qu’ils soient éducatifs, institutionnels ou médicamenteux. Une approche psychiatrique exclusive sera erronée. Notamment les traitements médicamenteux sont souvent inappropriés, source de conflits entre les professionnels, avec les familles, et aussi, parfois, avec la justice.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Myoclonus is a sudden, brief, shock-like, involuntary movement caused by muscular contractions (positive myoclonus) or inhibition (negative myoclonus). Myoclonus is not a diagnosis but rather a descriptive term for the clinical event. However, it is a useful sign of clinical significance that may lead to a syndromic diagnosis. Myoclonic jerks may be subtle or may interfere severely with the execution of even the simplest motor task. REVIEW SUMMARY In this review, we describe the classification of myoclonus and the many possible variant and pathophysiological features. Myoclonus may arise from various sites in the neuraxis, including the cortex, subcortex, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. Electrodiagnostic testing may be useful for clinical diagnosis and may impact therapeutic options. Myoclonus may be difficult to differentiate from other hyperkinetic movement disorders with similar presentations. Therapy is limited and usually symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS Careful attention should be given to the fundamental clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of the hyperkinetic movement phenomenology and the clinical circumstances in which myoclonus appears. This approach may provide clues to the underlying neurologic disorder and may also suggest appropriate treatment options. (THE NEUROLOGIST 7:171-179, 2001)",

      "abstract": "Background: This is a case series of clinical cases presenting to our Neuropsychiatry Center, who were either referred by physicians or approached to seek treatment on their own. They were receiving treatment since few years. No improvement in symptom were primary reason for referral and consultation with our team. Re-evaluation in realms of Neurology and Psychiatry depicted the missed link in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches exercised previously. The intent to reflect upon novel findings is not to undermine the effort applied in clinical evaluation by prior physicians, but to reflect few observations which may have been inadvertently missed during routine assessment. This serves as as an aide-memoire to history taking and suggestions to remain well informed and updated in our approach to service seekers. Abstract: Symptom overlap and comorbidities are commonly encountered in clinical practice of Psychiatry or Neurology. Many neurologic disorders have psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression in patients following a stroke or with multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease), and many psychiatric disorders have been associated with neurologic symptoms (e.g., movement disorders in schizophrenia). This overlap occurs mostly because brain is the source common for both neurological and psychiatric illness and on multiple occasion it becomes difficult to delineate the boundary, leading to diagnostic dilemmas, followed by inappropriate management strategies. Patients and family members suffer for long periods of time in trying to understand the disease phenomenon and prognosis. In this case series, we present 3 cases of clinical interest across different framework of clinical presentation and assessment for e.g, neurological illness being managed as psychiatric illness or scenarios where both neurological and psychiatric illness coexisted but only one aspect was addressed. Re-assessment and work up by a team of neurologists and psychiatrist lead to clarification of the boundaries (at least in these cases who underwent prolonged sufferings owing to lack in clarity of pathology) with precise diagnosis generating improved outcomes in functionality and satisfaction. The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders is performed by psychiatrists through diagnostic interviews, and categorization of patients based on diagnostic and classification manual (ICD-10, DSM-5) which are syndrome/symptom based. Although this has been a standard practice, often error may occur in diagnosing illnesses falling under the wider realm of neurology and psychiatry. Some presenting symptoms may be assumed being part of neurological illness or of functional origin, or mixed states and many may be overlooked during routine clinical assessment.",

      "title": "Deficits in cholinergic neurotransmission and their clinical correlates in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract In view of its ability to explain the most frequent motor symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD), degeneration of dopaminergic neurons has been considered one of the disease’s main pathophysiological features. Several studies have shown that neurodegeneration also affects noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic and other monoaminergic neuronal populations. In this work, the characteristics of cholinergic deficits in PD and their clinical correlates are reviewed. Important neurophysiological processes at the root of several motor and cognitive functions remit to cholinergic neurotransmission at the synaptic, pathway, and circuital levels. The bulk of evidence highlights the link between cholinergic alterations and PD motor symptoms, gait dysfunction, levodopa-induced dyskinesias, cognitive deterioration, psychosis, sleep abnormalities, autonomic dysfunction, and altered olfactory function. The pathophysiology of these symptoms is related to alteration of the cholinergic tone in the striatum and/or to degeneration of cholinergic nuclei, most importantly the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and the pedunculopontine nucleus. Several results suggest the clinical usefulness of antimuscarinic drugs for treating PD motor symptoms and of inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase for the treatment of dementia. Data also suggest that these inhibitors and pedunculopontine nucleus deep-brain stimulation might also be effective in preventing falls. Finally, several drugs acting on nicotinic receptors have proved efficacious for treating levodopa-induced dyskinesias and cognitive impairment and as neuroprotective agents in PD animal models. Results in human patients are still lacking.",

      "abstract": "Aim: Conversion disorder is a situation where psychological stress is expressed physically. This health problem is usually triggered by a stressful or a mental crisis. When involving a physical problem it is named as ’conversion disorder’. Psychogenic gait disturbance is a common conversion disorder. Anorexia nervosa is a totally different disease than conversion disorder by its clinical presentation and characteristics. We present a patient suffering from anorexia nervosa and developing conversion disorder in form of a gait disturbance. Presentation of Case: A 35 year-old woman was suffering from excessive obsessions about her body. She had avoidance of eating and loss of 18 kilograms. She was admitted to our hospital for obtaining a disabled certificate for her walking disability that continued for 6 months. Her gait disturbance was indeterminate as to being neurological or orthopedic and was aggravated by stress. Discussion: Even though anorexia nervosa and conversion disorder are two different pathologies, they may be seen together, meaning that patients with one disease may Case Study Balkuv et al.; JSRR, Article no. JSRR.2014.005 584 develop symptoms of another disease as means of secondary gain. However, a psychogenic movement disorder is a rare presentation in this situation. Conclusion: Psychogenic gait disturbances are relatively rare psychogenic movement disorders. Conversion disorder may be the underlying problem. In our case, patient was masking, involuntarily, her primary problem (anorexia nervosa) by attracting attention to her gait. Such situations complicate the diagnosis and treatment of both diseases, which should be kept in mind.",

      "abstract": "A variety of psychologic disorders may present as physical complaints without organic basis. As characterized by Sydenham over 300 years ago, such disorders \"mimic all the physical disease to which man is heir.\" The case here presents the evolution of a conversion disorder (urinary retention) in response to a decision to terminate pregnancy. The predominant disturbance in a conversion disorder is an involuntary loss or alteration in somatic function that is temporally related with an environmental stressor. Conversion, as a defense mechanism, provides primary gain by keeping the conflict from the patient's awareness and secondary gains by generating environmental support and avoidance of undesired activities. Awareness of a patient's current life events, past responses to stress, and support systems is essential in order to recognize and manage this array of physical complaints of functional origin.The case report discussed here presents the evolution of a conversion disorder (urinary retention) in response to a decision to terminate a pregnancy. According to the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM 3), the following are the current criteria for a diagnosis of conversion (psychogenic pain): the predominant disturbance is a loss of or alteration in physical functioning suggesting a physical disorder; psychological factors are judged to be etiologically involved as evidenced by 1 of the following--a temporal relationship exists between an environmental stimulus that apparently related to a psychological conflict or need and the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom, the symptom enables the individual to get support from the environment that otherwise might not be forthcoming, and the symptom enables the individual to avoid some noxious activity; it has been determined that the symptom is not under voluntary control; and the symptom cannot be explained by a known physical disorder or pathophysiologic mechanism. A 25-year old single white woman (para 0, gravida 1) was hospitalized for termination of pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation. The patient told her physician that she did not know she was pregnant. The operative procedure was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged. 5 days later she presented to the emergency room with the complaint that she was unable to void. Following catheterization, which recovered 800 mL of urine, the patient returned home. Within 24 hours she again complained of an inability to void. Admission to the gynecological service resulted in a 16-day stay involving a continued inability to void requiring repeated catheterizations. Psychiatric consultation revealed marked immaturity, an inappropriately labile affect, and indifference to her symptoms. A history of occasional substance abuse was elicited. Upon transfer to the psychiatric inpatient service, the patient began to void spontaneously. The reported incidence of psychiatric sequelae after therapeutic or legal abortion is low, but the degree of preabortion emotional difficulty appears in direct proportion to the incidence of postabortion behavioral complications. The selection of a target organ for conversion is often based upon its ability to achieve symbolic representation. In the case presented the anatomic proximity of the bladder and uterus is cogent with the Freudian concent of somatic compliance whereby a previous somatic injury or disease may dictate the conversion focus by reactivation of the original event.",

      "title": "Un diagnostic \"psy\" invisible : le cas du trouble d'adaptation",
      "abstract": "Le trouble d'adaptation (TA) est un diagnostic defini par le DSM comme une reaction psychologique a un evenement de vie penible. Sa prevalence clinique est relativement elevee en premiere ligne medicale ou il fait parfois figure de diagnostic officieux de « depression mineure » et d' « epuisement professionnel ». Bien que le TA soit un diagnostic frequemment utilise en clinique medicale, il demeure relativement peu etudie. A peine une centaine de publications scientifiques abordent le diagnostic dans des revues savantes depuis son introduction en 1980. Un tel chiffre contraste avec les milliers d'etudes menees sur les autres diagnostics psychiatriques dont la prevalence est comparable, notamment la depression majeure. Cette faible attention scientifique portee au TA interpelle plusieurs chercheurs. La principale hypothese retenue jusqu'a maintenant pour expliquer ce phenomene est le caractere non specifique de la definition du TA qui entrainerait des obstacles methodologiques significatifs. Cependant, plusieurs autres attributs du diagnostic paraissent susceptibles de limiter son etude, dont sa nature relativement benigne vis-a-vis des autres troubles psychiatriques. Afin d'eclaircir les raisons derriere la faible attention scientifique portee au TA, nous avons procede a une analyse de contenu thematique de la litterature scientifique abordant specifiquement le diagnostic. Nous avons ainsi recolte cent quinze textes publies dans des revues savantes depuis trente ans ayant l'expression « trouble d'adaptation » dans leur titre. Apres categorisation des textes scientifiques et identification des principales dimensions substantives associees au TA, nous avons pu degager les principaux attributs du diagnostic susceptibles de repondre a notre question de recherche. Cette etude, qui propose un regard sociologique inedit sur le diagnostic du TA, laisse voir que la faible attention scientifique dont il est l'objet est le produit de plusieurs facteurs. D'abord, bien que defini par la psychiatrie, l'objet d'etude que represente TA se derobe vraisemblablement de cette specialite medicale par son profil phenomenologique mineur, par l'absence de substrat biologique associe ainsi que par l'approche pharmacotherapeutique minimale qu'on preconise a l'egard du diagnostic. Ensuite, l'ambiguite fondamentale qui caracterise le TA, le savoir tacite du DSM que requiert son etude ainsi que le benefice que le diagnostic retire d'une forme d'invisibilite contribuent aussi a reduire l'extension de la recherche a son endroit. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : trouble d'adaptation, diagnostic, depression, clinique, psychiatrie",

Most writers have been content with general statements regarding pathologic findings as explanatory of symptoms, as, for example, numerous cortical areas of sclerosis, or many sclerotic patches in the pons or oblongata or the cord showing plaques in both sensory and motor tracts.

An abnormality in this circuitry, normally used to coordinate both motor and mental activity, leads to misconnections in many aspects of mental activity, or \"cognitive dysmetria.\" As Bleuler originally proposed, \"thought disorder\" is the primary defining feature of schizophrenia, rather than the more obvious signs and symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Cognitive dysmetria, or a disorder in the CCTCC, may provide a heuristic theoretical framework for strategies to explore etiology, pathophysiology, intervention, or prevention.",

Bei Patienten mit ParkinsonKrankheit finden sich kognitive Defizite bei 40 bis 80% der erkrankten Personen. Obwohl im Durchschnitt mehr als 40% der Patienten mit zentralnervosen neurologischen Erkrankungen an kognitiven Leistungseinbusen leiden, werden kognitive Storungen als klinischer Parameter in der Diagnostik und Therapie haufig nicht berucksichtigt. Mittels neuropsychologischer Testverfahren konnen die betroffenen Domanen klinisch identifiziert und naher klassifiziert werden. Neben der Demenz finden sich bei den Patienten ebenfalls psychische und Verhaltenssymptome wie emotionale Verstimmungen, Depressionen, Angstzustande und vermehrte Aggressionsausbruche sowie Veranderungen der Personlichkeit. All diese Faktoren fuhren zu einer zunehmenden Beeintrachtigung und haben einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die Lebensqualitat nicht nur des Betroffenen, sondern fuhren ebenfalls zu einer zunehmenden Belastung der Angehorigen, verandern die Krankheitsprognose und stellen im fortgeschrittenen Stadium einen der wichtigsten Grunde fur eine Heimeinweisung dar. Bei vielen neurologischen Erkrankungen sind die neurologischen Kardinalsymptome bereits einer medikamentosen Behandlung zuganglich, wahrend dies bei den kognitiven Symptomen schwieriger ist. Derzeit sind nur vier Medikamente zur Behandlung der Demenz zugelassen (Cholinesterasehemmer: Donepezil, Galantamin, Rivastigmin und der NMDA-Antagonist Memantin), die aber uber die AlzheimerDemenz hinaus, meist keine Zulassung fur kognitive Storungen bei anderen neurologischen Erkrankungen besitzen. Die Studienlage ist fur die Cholinesterasehemmer und Memantin fur den Einsatz bei kognitiven Defiziten bei neurologischen Erkrankungen ungenugend. Daruber hinaus werden in Deutschland mehr als 200 Millionen Euro jahrlich fur „antidementive“ Substanzen ausgegeben, die keine Evidenz fur einen klinischen Effekt nachweisen konnen.

      "abstract": "Psychomotor activity is one of the traits we most immediately perceive in others. Psychomotor slowing, which can be easily noticed on a first medical examination, is a symptom which may be prodromal of psychic disturbances. Historically, psychomotor retardation is a characteristic attached to depression, especially melancholia. Some studies show that psychomotor retardation is associated with good therapeutic prognosis, including positive response to electro-convulsivo-therapy. The cluster of non-verbal symptoms includes both basic aspects related to motor behavior such as attitudes and movements and more complex aspects such as goal-directed behaviors. We will see that this intuitive and fundamental dimension of clinical depression is not homogeneous. From a motor point of view, hypo-bradykinesia in depression may be compared to the one found in cortico-subcortical syndromes such as Parkinson's disease. This comparison suggests that key brain structures such as the basal ganglia could be involved in depression. Moreover, the loss of vital energy is the dominant psychopathological explanation linked to psychomotor retardation. From a phenomenological point of view, this interpretation seems to be relevant but appears disappointing as an experimental variable. However, motivation, understood as the factor that energizes the behavior seems to be an interesting and promising concept. Experimentally, it is possible to measure how much an individual is able to invest energy in order to achieve a goal. The impact of depression on the process of incentive motivation will be analyzed before turning to a description of therapeutic interventions related to psychomotor field such as sports or sensorimotor stimulations that appear to be promising tracks for clinical improvement.",

Originally, as ‘adjustment reaction’, it was one of a very few disorder categories included in major psychiatric classification schemes specifically for use in children and adolescents. In DSM-I, for instance, adjustment reaction and childhood schizophrenia were the only two categories of childhood psychiatric disorder. The intention was to indicate that some instances of disordered behaviour or emotions arose specifically because of an identified stressor rather than, say, a process of mental illness. The source of stress was originally thought of as including both external events (such as bereavement) or an internal developmental process, which might require significant adaptation of mental functioning (such as maturational changes during adolescence). There was an implicit idea that adjustment to adversity or intra-psychic conflict could be either adaptive or maladaptive. If it was maladaptive, then personal dysfunction was to be seen as a psychiatric condition.",

Les troubles de l'accommodation representent un effet indesirable oculaire, souvent mentionne dans les resumes des caracteristiques des medicaments. Ils peuvent se manifester de plusieurs facons, allant d'un simple inconfort en vision de loin ou de pres a des symptomes plus marques tels qu'une fatigue oculaire ou des cephalees. On definit les troubles de l'accommodation soit par : -­ Une perte ou une paralysie de l'accommodation qui s'explique par une gene ou une incapacite a lire de pres sans correction. Il s'agit d'une atteinte du muscle ciliaire et/ou a une mydriase par stimulation du nerf sympathique ou par inhibition du systeme parasympathique. -­ Un spasme d'accommodation a l'origine d'une myopie transitoire. Cela s'explique par la contraction permanente du muscle ciliaire et s'associe, en cas d'origine medicamenteuse, a un myosis par stimulation excessive du systeme parasympathique. Les medicaments parasympathomimetiques induisent ainsi un myosis actif, et les medicaments parasympatholytiques une mydriase passive. A l'inverse, les medicaments sympathomimetiques alpha-­adrenergiques provoquent une mydriase active, et les medicaments sympatholytiques alpha-­adrenergiques un myosis passif.

Le pharmacien est un acteur important dans la prise en charge des patients. Il permet, grâce a ses conseils, d'accompagner le patient en matiere d'effets indesirables et de lui signaler leur survenue eventuelle en matiere de vision. Afin de mieux maitriser les risques de troubles de l'accommodation, le pharmacien doit garder une formation continue, et etre vigilant quant aux risques que comporte chaque molecule commercialisee.",

      "abstract": "At least three types of ictal atomic phenomena can be seen in partial seizures. Focal atomic seizures are partial seizures with ictal paresis or paralysis of one or more body parts preceding or independent of any convulsive activity. A diagnosis may be difficult without simultaneous EEG recording supplemented by video monitoring or polygraphy. Epileptic negative myoclonus manifests as brief lapses in tone in one or more muscle groups that interferes with motor coordination and postural control. Drop attacks can also occur in partial seizures, as have been well documented in patients with temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Different mechanisms may underlie these three phenomena. Focal atonic seizures probably result from relatively circumscribed seizure activity in one or more cortical areas that contribute to the elaboration and execution of motor functions. Whether this represents inactivation or interference in motor integration, or activation of inhibitory system, remains unresolved. The pathophysiology of epileptic negative myoclonus, like that of its positive counterpart, is probably to be found at a more local level, possibly from transiently enhanced local inhibition in the motor cortex. Drop attacks in partial seizures may be close in mechanism to that also seen in generalized seizures, possibly related to ictal activation of descending inhibitory pathways in the brainstem.",

Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves coordinate the cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, and sudomotor responses that regulate blood pressure, heart rate, thermal equilibrium, and other automatic bodily functions. Knowledge of autonomic physiology is key to the recognition and diagnosis of autonomic failure, orthostatic hypotension, autonomic neuropathies, localizable regional autonomic disorders, neurodegenerative and general medical disorders that affect autonomic function. An important example is neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, which can result from impaired sympathetic vasoconstriction of peripheral vascular beds, impaired carotid baroreflex responses, or impaired autonomic influence on cardiac output. Another example is thermoregulatory failure from ineffective cutaneous sudomotor or vasomotor responses. Accurate measurement and valid interpretation of autonomic responses in the clinical laboratory rest on an understanding of autonomic physiology.",

Polysomnography may be necessary for the differential diagnosis of organic sleep disorders. Insomnia is a frequent comorbidity of most mental disorders and many physical diseases. It is treated according to guidelines with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). CBT-I is offered in individual or group format as well as online-supported treatment. If behavioural therapy is not effective or not available, pharmacotherapy can be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Recent investigations of cognitive and behavioral function in myotonic dystrophy appear to counter a number of the prevailing notions regarding this disorder. Myotonic dystrophy is characterized neither by intellect outside the range of normal (except in those infrequent cases of neonatal myotonic dystrophy) nor by intellectual deterioration. Apparent cognitive deficits more likely result from reversible neuroamine dysfunction associated with a biological depressive illness that may be an intrinsic part of the disorder of myotonic dystrophy. Much of the purported emotional problems, “personality disturbances and social deterioration”, represent symptomatology of this biological depressive illness. This depressive component seems to be responsive to tricyclic antidepressant treatment; such pharmacotherapy also provides additional benefit to other symptoms including gastrointestinal dysfunction, hypersomnia, myotonia, and muscular weakness. It seems probable that the basic genetic defect (possibly involving membrane structure) in myotonic dystrophy results in abnormal aminergic and peptidergic receptors and that dysfunction of the limbic system of the brain is only one of many disturbances caused by the receptor abnormalities.",

      "abstract": "A esquizofrenia é uma doença mental crônica que afeta a maneira como uma pessoa pensa, sente e se comporta. Caracterizada por sintomas como delírios, alucinações, confusão e dificuldade de concentração, seus sintomas podem variar em intensidade e frequência, geralmente se manifestando na adolescência ou início da idade adulta. Afetando cerca de 1% da população mundial, a esquizofrenia tem raízes em uma complexa interação entre fatores genéticos, neurobiológicos e ambientais. Alterações nos neurotransmissores, como dopamina e glutamato, desempenham um papel significativo na fisiopatologia da doença, que também está ligada a anomalias estruturais e funcionais do cérebro. O diagnóstico da esquizofrenia é feito através de uma avaliação clínica detalhada, com critérios estabelecidos como os do DSM-5 ou CID-10. O tratamento geralmente envolve uma combinação de medicamentos antipsicóticos, como clorpromazina, haloperidol, olanzapina, risperidona e quetiapina, e terapia psicossocial. A escolha do medicamento depende de vários fatores, incluindo a gravidade dos sintomas e a tolerabilidade do paciente. Embora esses medicamentos sejam eficazes no controle dos sintomas, eles podem estar associados a efeitos colaterais, e é essencial monitorar de perto os pacientes durante o tratamento. Um estudo recente revisou a literatura dos últimos 5 anos sobre métodos terapêuticos medicamentosos para o controle da esquizofrenia. Foram selecionados 6 estudos que abordaram tratamentos eficazes para a esquizofrenia, incluindo medicamentos como xanomelina, tróspio, dexmedetomidina, raloxifeno, tropissetron, blonanserina e olanzapina. Esses estudos mostraram redução dos sintomas da esquizofrenia, apesar de apresentarem diferentes perfis de efeitos colaterais e eficácia. Mais pesquisas são necessárias para compreender totalmente o potencial de cada medicamento no tratamento desse transtorno. Em suma, a esquizofrenia é uma condição que requer uma abordagem holística e colaborativa, com tratamentos eficazes e monitoramento cuidadoso dos pacientes para melhorar sua qualidade de vida.",

This is when a person is conditioned to expect a negative response, or to anticipate negative effects from an experience. These findings highlight the importantance of effective communication with patients and the influence that good anxiety and pain management control can have in improving treatment outcomes. The placebo effect has been widely researched, but new studies have shown that nocebo can have a greater effect than placebo The nocebo effect is prevalent in interactions between patients and healthcare workers. Research has demonstrated that if a patient deems a healthcare professional not to understand or believe them, this can cause distress, and the physiological effect can reduce the prognosis of treatment. It has also been demonstrated that patients who are anxious or expect pain during a procedure, feel more pain because of this negative expectation.",

Sport transitions may be accompanied by changes in identity, interpersonal relationships, schedules, and behavioural changes. Psychosocial outcomes following sport retirement can be broadly differentiated between acute psychological distress, mental health disorders, and healthy adjustment. Acute psychological distress following sport retirement may be best understood in the context of stressful life events. Stressful life events, such as job transitions and family conflict, have been shown to predict the onset of mental health concerns, such as depression. Sport retirement is a significant life event, and negative emotions are a common response to the transition. Adjustment disorder is characterised by the onset of emotional or behavioural symptoms within three months of an identifiable stressor and does not persist past six months after termination of the stressor.",

      "title": "Role of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders",
      "abstract": "There is abundant evidence for abnormalities of the norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5HT) neurotransmitter systems in depression and anxiety disorders. The majority of evidence supports underactivation of serotonergic function and complex dysregulation of noradrenergic function, most consistent with overactivation of this system. Treatment for these disorders requires perturbation of these systems. Reproducible increases in serotonergic function and decreases in noradrenergic function accompany treatment with antidepressants, and these alterations may be necessary for antidepressant efficacy. Dysregulation of these systems clearly mediates many symptoms of depression and anxiety. The underlying causes of these disorders, however, are less likely to be found within the NE and 5HT systems, per se. Rather their dysfunction is likely due to their role in modulating, and being modulated by, other neurobiologic systems that together mediate the symptoms of affective illness. Clarification of noradrenergic and serotonergic modulation of various brain regions may yield a greater understanding of specific symptomatology, as well as the underlying circuitry involved in euthymic and abnormal mood and anxiety states. Disrupted cortical regulation may mediate impaired concentration and memory, together with uncontrollable worry. Hypothalamic abnormalities likely contribute to altered appetite, libido, and autonomic symptoms. Thalamic and brainstem dysregulation contributes to altered sleep and arousal states. Finally, abnormal modulation of cortical-hippocampal-amygdala pathways may contribute to chronically hypersensitive stress and fear responses, possibly mediating features of anxiety, anhedonia, aggression, and affective dyscontrol. The continued appreciation of the neural circuitry mediating affective states and their modulation by neurotransmitter systems should further the understanding of the pathophysiology of affective and anxiety disorders.",

With the aggressive nature and rapid progression,presenting symptoms include increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and focal neurologic symptomsd. Genetics 1) Secondary glioblastomas (malignant transformationof lower grade glioma to glioblastoma) can be associated with mutation of gene encoding PDGF-α, loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN (LOH at chromosome 10q)2) Primary (de novo) glioblastomas a) Have no apparent antecedent low-or intermediate-grade tumor history b) Are often associated with amplification of theproto-oncogenes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MDM2, loss of tumor suppressorgene PTEN, LOH at chromosome 10, and mutation involving the RB genee. Most common locations: deep white matter and deep gray matter, including thalamus and basal gangliaf.

Microscopic features 1) Compact pilocytic arrangements of elongated (some-times stellate) cells admixed with microcystic areas 2) Classic feature: abundant Rosenthal fibers, may beslight nuclear pleomorphism and rare mitoses j. 5-Year postoperative survival: 85% to 100% (95%-100% for cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas) k. Cerbellar pilocytic astrocytomas have the best prognosisof all primary brain tumors l. Treatment1) Maximal surgical excision of tumor 2) Surgical excision of the mural nodule may be3) Marginal benefit from radiotherapy d. 2-Year survival after treatment, 5% to 10%E. Circumscribed Astrocytomas 1. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Usually occur in first or second decade of life b. Better prognosis than diffuse astrocytomas c. Common locations: cerebellum (hemispheres &gt; vermis),optic chiasm, hypothalamus, and periventricular area of third and fourth ventricles (Fig. 16-7 A)d. Less common locations: spinal cord (Fig. 16-7 B and C), brainstem, cerebral hemispheres (temporal lobe is most common hemisphere site); tend to occur in older age group (young adults)e. Cerebellar hemisphere tumors: often large cystic, fluidfilled masses appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with strongly (but somewhat heterogeneously) contrast-enhancing mural nodulef. Optic and hypothalamic gliomas: tend to be solid, pilocytic tumorsadequate and cystic wall need not be removed 3) With increasing thickness or enhancement of nodulewall, the cystic wall also needs to be removed 4) Nonresectable tumors or recurrence with malignanttransformation may require adjuvant radiotherapy 2. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (WHO grade II orIII) a. Occur in second or third decade of life (average age atdiagnosis, 26 years) b. Often a history of seizures c. May originate from subpial astrocytes d. Macroscopic features1) Well-encapsulated tumor frequently containing a mural nodule within a cyst2) Often located superficially in temporal lobe e. Microsocopic features1) Large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, some containing lipid droplets2) Nuclear pleomorphism 3) Rare mitosesf.

Treatment1) Often includes complete resection 2) Radiation and chemotherapy often reserved forrecurrent or malignant tumors h. Postresection survival rates: 81% at 5 years, 70% at10 years; relatively benign prognosis 3. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Very slow-growing tumors, always associated with tuberous sclerosis (found in up to 14% of patients with tuberous sclerosis)b. Presentation: usually in first or second decade of life c. Usually originate near foramen of Monro, blocking CSFoutflow and causing hydrocephalus d. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, lobulated redmass (vascular tumor), often calcified and cysticLarge cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic granular bodies are a characteristic feature of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which is a low-grade gliomae. Microscopic features 1) Large, oval cells with abundant eosinophilic cyto-plasm and large, eccentric nucleus; often surround blood vessels in this vascular tumor2) Pleomorphism is often present 3) Mitoses and necrosis are unusualf. Neuroimaging: isointense or hyperintense on T2weighted images; intense, heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted imaging with contrastg. Definitive treatment for symptomatic patients (i.e., hydrocephalus) or extensive tumors: surgical resectionh. Unless symptomatic, patients are only followed with periodic neuroimagingF. Special Considerations 1. Optic gliomas (Fig. 16-8)a. 3% to 5% of all childhood brain tumors b. 2% of gliomas in adults c. Female predominance (female:male = 2:1) d. More common in children: 50% of patients presentbefore age 5, 90% before age 20 e. Tumors involving optic nerve alone have a betterprognosis than those involving optic chiasm (which have better prognosis than hypothalamic gliomas, although aggressive tumors involving optic chiasm may spread to involve hypothalamus)f. Associated with NF1 1) Occur in 1% to 7% of children with NF1 2) As many as 50% of patients with optic gliomas haveNF1 3) Almost all patients with bilateral optic nerve tumorssparing optic chiasm have NF1 g. Slow-growing tumors; malignant histologic features oraggressive behavior are rare (reported in cases of optic chiasm and hypothalamic gliomas)h. Usually pilocytic astrocytomas causing either diffuse expansion without subarachnoid involvement or primary subarachnoid spread with minimal involvement of optic nervei. Symptoms unique to optic nerve gliomas 1) Visual loss, visual field defects, painless proptosis, andsymptoms related to increased intracranial pressure 2) Symptoms of hypothalamic involvementa) Endocrinopathies: precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, other related endocrinopathiesb) Gelastic seizures: characterized by involuntarylaughter, more common with hypothalamic hamartomasc) “Diencephalic syndrome”: emaciation, cachexia and loss of subcutaneous fat, emesis, pallor, hyperactivity, inappropriate behavior, euphoriaj. Treatment 1) Considered for tumors with aggressive behavior, espe-cially for patients presenting with visual deterioration 2) Radiotherapy considered for patients older than 5years presenting with tumors in locations other than intraorbital (intracranial locations such as chiasmal or retrochiasmal) and when total resection is not possible3) Chemotherapy considered for patients younger than 5 years4) Surgical excision may be limited to biopsy, especially for tumors involving optic chiasm2. Brainstem gliomas a. Account for 10% to 15% of brain tumors in children(&lt;5% of gliomas in adults) b. Age at diagnosis: often between 5 and 10 years c. Heterogeneous group of neoplasms: all grades of pathol-ogy observed, but most are malignant, with poor prognosisd. Symptoms: usually related to ataxia and other cerebellarfeatures, long tract signs, or cranial nerve deficits e. Neuroimaging (can predict prognosis better than patho-logic features) 1) Lesions appear as a high T2 signal with variabledegrees of enhancement 2) May contain a cystic component (Fig. 16-9) 3) Diffuse pontine gliomas: all are malignant 4) Most gliomas involving cervicomedullary junction arelow-grade gliomas 5) Tumors of midbrain usually have a better prognosisthan those involving medulla or pons 6) Dorsal exophytic tumors tend to have betterprognosis f. Prognosis1) Best for focal lesions, dorsal exophytic tumors, low histologic grade, longer period from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, adult age group, and in context of neurofibromatosis2) 5-Year survival: 5% to 30% g. Treatment1) Best: radiotherapy 2) Surgical resection usually involves stereotactic biopsy;is best performed on focal, cystic, or exophytic tumorsG. Rare Astrocytic Variants 1. Gliosarcomas: high-grade gliomas admixed with sarco-ma (variant of glioblastoma multiforme, with same prognosis)2. Gliofibroma a. Glioma admixed with population of cells resemblingfibroblasts b. Usually present in the first decadeH. Oligodendroglioma 1. From cells of oligodendroglial origin (O2A progenitorcells)2. Genetics a. Development of low-grade oligodendrogliomas: associ-ated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p, 19q, and 4qb. Development of high-grade oligodendrogliomas from the low-grade tumors: associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 9p and 10qc. Both are associated with overexpression of EGFR 3. Account for 5% of all primary brain tumors and 30%of all intracranial gliomas 4. May be a male predominance (male:female = 3:2) 5. More often presents in adults: usually present betweenthird and fifth decades 6. Small earlier peak in childhood between 6 and 12 years;thalamic location at presentation is common in children7. Seizures are often the initial presentation in up to 75% of patients because tumor commonly involves cerebral cortex8. Most common location: frontal lobe, followed by temporal and parietal lobes; rarely brainstem or spinal cord9. Slow-growing, infiltrative gliomas: may start in subcortical white matter, tend to spread along white matter tracts and corpus callosum10. Better prognosis than astrocytomas 11. 5-Year survival rate, 75% 12. Mean postoperative survival, 4 to 11 years13. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, unencapsulated mass with cystic degeneration and calcification (necrosis and hemorrhage are rare)14. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-10) a. Variable b. Homogeneously appearing cells with sparse cytoplasmand round, uniform nuclei c. Cells may appear elongated, with a displaced nucleus;because of fixation artifact, there may be artifactual clearing of the cytoplasm, resembling fried eggsd. There may be mucin-rich microcystic spaces e. Capillaries interposed between uniform-appearing cellsmay form a delicate vascular “chicken-wire” pattern f. Pleomorphism and endothelial hyperplasia (less commonly,necrosis) indicate high-grade oligodendroglioma 15. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous appearing T2hyperintense mass often involving cerebral cortex with variable, heterogeneous enhancement pattern, cystic component, and calcification (in up to 90% of cases)16. Classified into high-grade and low-grade tumors 17. Features associated with high-grade tumors and lessfavorable prognosis a. Contrast enhancement b. Endothelial proliferation c. Mitotic figures d. More than 5% of MIB-1 staining e. Astrocytic component (with oligoastrocytomas, asdiscussed below) 18. Treatmenta. Gross total resection when possible (because tumor is infiltrative, microscopic infiltrates always remain)b. Primary adjuvant therapy: chemotherapy with alkylating agent such as temozolomide (before development of temozolomide, procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine [PVC] were used)c. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 1p or combined loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 19q (50%- 80% of cases) portend better prognosis, prolonged survival, and better response to chemotherapyd. Although intermediate-grade oligodendrogliomas are often chemotherapy-responsive (e.g., 1p/19q deleted tumors), radiation (often in combination with chemotherapy) is still the mainstay of treatment to achieve maximal survival advantageI. Oligoastrocytoma 1. Composed of different populations of cells, someresembling astrocytes, some oligodendrocytes, and some indeterminate2. A common progenitor cell that differentiates into two different cell lines is likely3. Glial tumors with predominant oligodendrocytic population of cells are often interpreted as oligodendrocytes4. Increasing proportion of oligodendroglial component generally portends better prognosis (chromosome 1p and 19q deletions signify greater sensitivity of tumor to chemotherapy)J. Ependymoma 1. Epidemiologya. 5% to 8% of all primary intracranial tumors b. Age at presentation often in the first decade, with asecond peak in the fourth decade (prognosis worse for patients younger than 3 years)c. Third most common brain tumor in children d. Location (pediatric population): intracranial (90%) orspinal cord (10%) e. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occuring in childrenare infratentorial and about 1/3 supratentorial f. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occur in children (mostlyinfratentorial), and more than 90% of spinal cord ependymomas occur in adults (mostly myxopapillary ependymomas)2. Symptoms at presentation (depend largely on tumor location) a. Intracranial tumors often occur on floor (more frequentthan roof or lateral recesses) of fourth ventricle (medul-loblastomas tend to arise most frequently from roof of fourth ventricle)b. May present with obstructive hydrocephalus and associated symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus3. Potential for CSF dissemination: because of close contact with CSF, there may be “drop metastasis” in 5% of cases4. Myxopapillary ependymomas a. Well-encapsulated, indolent, slow-growing vasculartumors arising from filum terminale b. Occur most often in adults c. Associated with good prognosis5. Posterior fossa ependymomas a. Well-demarcated tumors that tend to fill fourth ventricleand extend through foramen magnum b. Appear as T2 hyperintense masses with heterogeneoussignal that may represent tumor vascularity (or necrosis) c. Often a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement6. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-11) a. Sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei and variablecytoplasm among perivascular anuclear fibrillary processes: “pseudorosettes” (fine cellular fibrillary processes that radiate toward blood vessel)b. Myxopapillary ependymomas are characterized by sheets of uniform columnar or cuboidal cells admixed with pools of mucin often bordered by tumor cells and containing a central blood vesselc. Cytologic pleomorphism, necrosis, mitotic figures, and giant cells often signify anaplastic ependymomas7. Treatment: surgical resection and/or adjuvant radiotherapy (optimal outcome with doses between 5,000 cGy and 5,500 cGy) a. Higher survival with gross total resection: goal is toobtain maximal possible resection b. For low-grade ependymomas of spine parenchyma orfilum terminale (myxopapillary ependymoma): surgical resection is mainstay of treatment, radiation is considered if residual tumor is present postoperativelyc. Extensive craniospinal radiation to entire neuroaxis required for patients presenting with CSF disseminationd. Response to chemotherapy is suboptimal; this treatment modality is considered for patients with contraindications to radiation (e.g., children younger than 3 years or patients with recurrent disease )8. Prognosis: generally favorable, especially adults with myxopapillary ependymomas (except for 10%-20% of cases that have CSF dissemination)9. Reduced survival has been associated with young age at onset and anaplastic histopathologic features, and higher risk of recurrence with partial resectionsK. Subependymoma 1. Slow-growing large firm masses most often occurring infourth ventricle, arising from medulla or lateral ventricles attached to septum pellucidum2. Age at presentation: usually between 40 and 60 years 3. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-12): cells with roundnuclei and sparse cytoplasm; admixed with microcystic clusters and foci of calcification on a fibrillary background4. Neuroimaging characteristics: mildly hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images often with heterogeneous appearance and little to no enhancementA. Ganglion Cell Neoplasms 1. Rare, slow-growing, benign well-circumscribed firmtumors often occurring in temporal lobes, sometimes with cystic or calcified foci2. Age at presentation: first 3 decades 3. Most common presentation: seizures (oftenintractable) 4. Predilection for temporal lobes (followed by frontal andparietal lobes); much less common, cerebellum and spinal cord5. Neuroimaging characteristics: classically appear as well-circumscribed cystic mass (hyperintense on T2weighted images) with a mural nodule with variable enhancement6. Microscopic features a. Presence of both neuronal (ganglion) and glial neoplasticcells b. Gangliocytoma: tumors with predominance ofneoplastic ganglion cells without an obvious astrocytic componentc. Ganglioglioma: tumors containing neoplastic glial cells that often outnumber ganglion cellsd. Some neoplastic ganglion cells are binucleated or multinucleated (unfortunately not always present, but quite helpful when present) (Fig. 16-13)7. Treatment a. Resection b. Radiotherapy: reserved for recurrent tumor or thosewith anaplastic histopathologic features 8. Prognosisa. Most carry benign prognosis with total or subtotal resectionb. Anaplastic histopathologic features: less favorable prognosisB. Central Neurocytomas 1. Neoplasms of neuronal differentiation 2. Rare (about 0.5% of all primary CNS tumors), occurprimarily in young adults between second and fourth decades3. Commonly present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (most commonly, headaches)4. Most commonly an intraventricular location, often at foramen of Monro: 50% of all intraventricular tumors in adults5. Microscopic features: sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei; immunoreactive for synaptophysin6. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous signal (isointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted images) with heterogeneous enhancement (Fig. 6-14)7. Treatment often involves resection (total, if possible) 8. Benign prognosis with total or subtotal resection, withlong survival ratesC. Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNET) 1.

Neuroimaging characteristics: hyperintense on T2weighted images (hypointense on T1-weighted images)5. Benign prognosis 6. Surgical resection usually reserved for symptomaticcases (e.g., intractable seizures)D. Lhermitte-Duclos Disease (dysplastic gangliocytoma of cerebellum)1. Commonly presents as slow-growing cerebellar mass with increased intracranial pressure2. Commonly presents in the fourth decade 3. Associated with Cowden’s disease (about 50% ofpatients with dysplastic gangliocytoma have clinical stigmata of Cowden’s disease)4. Macroscopic features: hypertrophied, thickened cerebellar folia (Fig. 16-15)5. Microscopic features a. Enlarged ganglion cells (neurons) replace granule cells,atrophy of granular layer b. Loss of Purkinje cells c. Reduction and cavitation of cerebellar white matter6. Neuroimaging: laminated increased T2 signal without enhancementE. Desmoplastic Infantile Astrocytoma (DIA) and Ganglioma (DIG)1. Rare, often occurring in the first 2 years of life 2.

      "title": "Parasomnias and Movement Disorders of Sleep",
      "abstract": "Neurologists are often enlisted to help diagnose, evaluate, and manage a spectrum of abnormal spells during the night ranging from parasomnias to motor disturbance that span the sleep-wake cycle. Parasomnias are undesirable emotional or physical events that accompany sleep. These events typically occur during entry into sleep from wakefulness, or during arousals from sleep, and are often augmented by the sleep state. Some parasomnias, such as the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder may be extremely undesirable, while others such as somniloquy are often of little concern. The parasomnias include a spectrum of abnormal emotions, movements, behaviors, sensory perceptions, dream mentation, and autonomic activity. Basic physiologic drives, such as sex, hunger, and aggression, may manifest as sleep-related eating, sleep-related sexual behaviors, and sleep-related violence. Parasomnias have a very bizarre nature, but are readily explainable, diagnosable, and treatable. They are hypothesized to be due to changes in brain organization across multiple states of being, and are particularly apt to occur during the incomplete transition or oscillation from one sleep state to another. Parasomnias are often explained on the basis that wakefulness and sleep are not mutually exclusive states, and abnormal intrusion of wakefulness into non-REM (NREM) sleep produces arousal disorders, and intrusion of wakefulness into REM sleep produces REM sleep parasomnias and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), two closely related conditions that often result in disturbed sleep onset and sleep maintenance, are also reviewed in this article. Although the mechanisms that underlie idiopathic RLS or PLMD are not fully understood, there is currently substantial evidence that dopaminergic dysfunction is likely involved in both conditions. The discussion will conclude with the \"other parasomnias\" and sleep-related movement disorders of clinical interest to the neurologist.",

      "title": "Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of the Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Successful training not only must involve overload but also must avoid the combination of excessive overload plus inadequate recovery. Athletes can experience short-term performance decrement without severe psychological or lasting other negative symptoms. This functional overreaching will eventually lead to an improvement in performance after recovery. When athletes do not sufficiently respect the balance between training and recovery, nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR) can occur. The distinction between NFOR and overtraining syndrome (OTS) is very difficult and will depend on the clinical outcome and exclusion diagnosis. The athlete will often show the same clinical, hormonal, and other signs and symptoms. A keyword in the recognition of OTS might be \"prolonged maladaptation\" not only of the athlete but also of several biological, neurochemical, and hormonal regulation mechanisms. It is generally thought that symptoms of OTS, such as fatigue, performance decline, and mood disturbances, are more severe than those of NFOR. However, there is no scientific evidence to either confirm or refute this suggestion. One approach to understanding the etiology of OTS involves the exclusion of organic diseases or infections and factors such as dietary caloric restriction (negative energy balance) and insufficient carbohydrate and/or protein intake, iron deficiency, magnesium deficiency, allergies, and others together with identification of initiating events or triggers. In this article, we provide the recent status of possible markers for the detection of OTS. Currently, several markers (hormones, performance tests, psychological tests, and biochemical and immune markers) are used, but none of them meet all the criteria to make their use generally accepted.",

It is not known to what extent these medical conditions precede or lead to depression. The present study proposes to identify somatic comorbities in a group of patients with major depressive disorder. The results show that many of the comorbidities identified may be metabolic risk factors for the development of other diseases or may even predispose to depression, as suggested by other studies in the literature. Patients with multiple comorbidities have a much higher risk of depression, which requires the implementation of a depression screening program and monitoring of patients at risk.

      "title": "Physical and Neurological Examination",
      "abstract": "Abstract In general medical patients, the physical examination typically comprises hypothesis-testing driven by the chief complaint and medical history, and screening for physical signs. A physical examination conducted by a medical psychiatrist can narrow a differential diagnosis and can search for physical symptoms that create functional impairment; quantify the severity of a known physical condition; help determine the emotional impact on the patient; enhance positive transference; and stimulate communication among other specialists. The 4 major types of physical examinations that are administered by medical psychiatrists are screening for medical diseases, investigating poorly explained symptoms, assessing status of a known disease, and a functionally focused examination. The neurological examination is used to detect deviations from normal function, to test hypotheses, and to measure the severity of a condition. This chapter details the essentials of both physical and neurological examinations which can help exclude conditions and diagnoses and determine the root causes of any distress or impairments.",

The symptoms are much like those of the common functional diseases of the nervous system, and may be spoken of as traumatic hysteria or traumatic neurasthenia. Commonly, however, we find symptoms of both of these disorders in the same patient and not rarely the clinical picture may not be that of either of them. Litigation is a frequent complication which materially affects the clinical history. It, not rarely, warps the judgment of the physician, and may doubly influence the patient, the many attendant conditions disastrously affecting his nervous system, while the money dangling over his head leads him, consciously or unconsciously, to distort his symptoms. The following cases are typical of a common form of traumatic neurosis, and a long period of observation gives special value to their study. I",

Insomnia was consistently predictive of depression, anxiety disorders, other psychological disorders, alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, and suicide, indicating insomnia is a risk factor for these difficulties. Additionally, insomnia was related to decreased immune functioning. The data were inconclusive regarding insomnia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but sleep medication use was predictive of mortality. These results must be tempered with the knowledge that significant weaknesses existed in the studies reviewed. The main weaknesses were inadequate definition of insomnia and inadequate control for alternative explanations. Despite these limitations, this review suggests that insomnia is a risk factor for poor mental and physical health.",

Veliki se dio pacijenata u veterinarskoj maloj praksi prezentira s različitim poremećajima neurološkog sustava što zbog složenosti dijagnostike i liječenja predstavlja veliki izazov za veterinare. Neurološki simptomi mogu biti posljedica primarne bolesti središnjeg ili perifernog živčanog sustava ili se mogu kod različitih sistemskih poremećaja javiti i sekundarno. Trijaža je postupak pomoću kojeg razvrstavamo stabilne od nestabilnih pacijenata, a daje i uvid u to koliko je njihovo zbrinjavanje hitno. Glavni cilj stabilizacije hitnih pacijenata je osigurati dostatnu količinu kisika mozgu, srcu i ostalim vitalnim organima. Detaljan se neurološki pregled pacijenata koji pokazuju neurološke simptome provodi nakon stabilizacije. Cilj neurološkog pregleda je ustanoviti je li poremećaj neurološkog karaktera, odrediti lokalizaciju lezije i njezinu etiologiju te težinu stanja u kojemu se pacijent nalazi. Neurološki pregled obuhvaća: procjenu mentalnog statusa i ponašanja, procjenu stava i položaja tijela u prostoru, prisutnost abnormalnih pokreta, promatranje hoda, testiranje reakcija održavanja stava i položaja u prostoru, pregled kranijalnih živaca i spinalnih refleksa, palpaciju tijela i testiranje percepcije bola. U većini slučajeva možemo odrediti mjesto lezije što je u konačnici bitno za sastavljanje liste diferencijalnih dijagnoza i daljnjih dijagnostičkih i terapijskih planova.

SD in MS patients may resultfrom a complex set of conditions and may be associated with multiple anatomic, physiologic, biologic, medical and psychological factors. SD arises primarily from lesions affecting the neural pathways involved in physiologic function. In addition, psychological factors, the side effects of medications and physical symptoms such as fatigue, muscular weakness, pain and concerns about bladder and bowel incontinence may also be involved. Since MS primarily affects young people, SD secondary to MS may have a great impact on quality of life.Thus, maintaining a healthy sexual life with MS is an important priority.",

What is unclear is how much impact the pharmaceutical industry has in defining what mental illness is or, more particularly, what constitutes depression and what treatment should be prescribed. It is being postulated that the biological model is taking hold (partly due to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). This emphasizes the biological aspect of depression rather than placing an emphasis on environmental issues (i.e., problems in living), hence, reducing knowledge pools into two distinct dichotomies (biological and psychological). The increased emphasis on the biological model appears to be in direct correlation with how emotions are being medicalized, ultimately impacting the rate of psychotropic therapy, which positively impacts the fiscal success of the pharmaceutical industry.",

Neurological examination is a simple method to assess these symptoms. Neurological signs come in two varieties; they are either of the hard or the soft type. Hard symptoms appear primarily in organic psychiatric disorders or as side effects of psychiatric therapy. They can also be encountered during neurological diseases of psychiatric patients. Their use in diagnostics and therapy is widely accepted. In contrast, soft neurological symptoms often stay unnoticed, even though they may contain important pieces of information. For this reason they will form the focus of our discussion. Soft neurological symptoms have been studied in different psychiatric disorder-groups. Up to now most attention has been devoted to schizophrenia. The study suggests that the soft symptoms are trait markers of schizophrenia. Furthermore they also signal disease activity and predict the outcome of the disease. Neurological symptoms are also important pointers for psychiatry. However, more systematic studies may increase the theoretical and practical implications of soft symptoms.",

They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results. Conclusions: It's very important to make a correct differential diagnosis that allows to approach to the disorder to avoid iatrogenia o unnecessary invasive tests.",

      "abstract": "When neurology and psychiatry moved apart from each other around the turn of the 20th century, casualties included the many patients with unexplained neurological disorders. Many labels have been applied to these patients. Some are descriptive (functional disorders, medically unexplained symptoms), while others refer to a presumed aetiology (psychogenic, hysteria, non-organic) or putative mechanism (dissociative or conversion disorder). Whatever is the label, for some physicians these patients are among the most interesting and challenging in the clinic. For others they are frustrating, using much time and resources for an often disappointing outcome.\n\nWhether you are an enthusiast or nihilist, it is clear that that neither neurology nor psychiatry alone have succeeded in sufficiently advancing our neurobiological understanding or management of these disorders. The slow progress is in stark contrast to the scale of the problem. Medically unexplained neurological symptoms account for ∼30% of referred neurology out-patients (Carson et al. , 2000; Stone et al. , 2009). Conversion disorder alone, explicitly associated with psychological stressors at the outset, accounts for ∼5% of referrals and is a stable, accurate diagnosis (Perkin, 1989; Stone et al. , 2005, 2009).\n\nPsychogenic movement disorders are common in neurological practice, including tremor, dystonia, gait change and paralysis. Diagnostic criteria emphasize clinical observations such as inconsistency, distractibility and false neurological signs (Fahn and Williams, 1988). These can be both sensitive and specific, at least in the context of a movement disorder clinic (Shill and Gerber, 2006). Physiological criteria have also been developed, such as coherence of tremor oscillations distinguishing psychogenic from organic syndromes (McAuley and Rothwell, 2004). The emphasis in this ‘neurological’ approach is on the physical examination, supplemented by physiological tests. The psychological aspects of the disease take second place, e.g. requiring ‘obvious’ but not specified psychiatric or emotional disturbance (Fahn and Williams, 1988 …",

      "title": "Dementia: mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In most individuals, the symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties after the sixth decade of life. Symptoms progress slowly, leading to significant impairment in memory, language, executive function, and other domains of cognition. Eventually, impaired cognitive abilities interfere with complex activities of daily life and ultimately result in the loss of independent function. The diagnosis is typically made in this context on the basis of clinical evidence of dementia with progressive impairment in multiple domains of cognition. Structural neuroimaging is often used in the clinical setting to evaluate for the presence of other pathologies (e.g. cerebrovascular or neoplastic disease). Functional neuroimaging, such as PET or SPECT, may be employed clinically to assist in the discrimination of different types of dementia (e.g. frontotemporal vs. Alzheimer’s dementia). Current treatments are primarily symptomatic, in that clinical trials demonstrate short-term stabilization of cognitive function but not a slowing of the rate of decline. Increasing emphasis is being placed on the development of disease-modifying therapies — drugs that impede the underlying pathophysiologic process of neurodegeneration in AD and, thereby, slow the rate of cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS) are neuropathic pain disorders of one or more extremities developing inadequately after trauma or lesions in the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS). However, CRPS may also develop spontaneously. CRPS are clinically characterized by sensory (pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia), autonomic (disturbances of skin temperature, color change, and presence of sweating abnormalities), and motor (paresis, tremor, and dystonia) disturbances. There has been growing evidence claiming that CRPS is a systemic disease involving the CNS and peripheral nervous system. The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms and signs, so that it could be under or over diagnosed. However, careful clinical evaluation and additional tests should lead to an adequate diagnosis. The goal of treatment is to improve function, relieve pain, and achieve remission. The clinical management of CRPS involves pharmacotherapy, non pharmacological pain coping skills such as physical, psychological and interventional therapies. Timely diagnosis and validation of clinical presentation for CRPS may result in a better outcome.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

RPK utiče na svakodnevne veštine ali i na školska postignuća. Visoka prevalencija (5-8 %) govori u prilog tome da u svakom razredu ili vrtićkoj grupi možemo očekivati jedno dete/učenika za ovim problemom. Danas, za dijagnostikovanje ovog poremećaja koristimo DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) klasifikaciju (četiri kriterijuma). Prema ovom statističkom priručniku RPK se dijagnostikuje ako je izvođenje motoričkih veština ispod hronološkog uzrasta, ako ometa svakodnevne aktivnosti, ako je početak u razvojnom periodu i ako se motorički deficit ne može objasniti nekim drugim oštećenjem (npr. cerebralnom paralizom). Etilogija RPK je multifaktorska. Najviše problema učenici sa RPK pokazuju na nastavi fizičkog vaspitanja, srpskog jezika i matematike. Teškoće sa kojima se susreću su mnogobrojne počev od problema pripreme za čas fizičkog vaspitanja, učešća u takmičarskim igrama, preko problema čitanja, pisanja i računanja. U osnovi ovih teškoća leži problem motoričkog učenja. Zbog svega, vrlo je važno koristiti odgovarajuće strategije za rad sa ovim učenicima. Pravovremenim tretmanom, primenom odgovarajućih metoda i strategija u radu može se uticati na dalji tok i ishod ovog razvojnog poremećaja.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The author of the two-part article about evaluating reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) responds to criticisms that a percentage impairment score may not adequately reflect the disability of an individual with RSD. The author highlights the importance of recognizing the difference between impairment and disability in the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ): impairment is the loss, loss of use, or derangement of any body part, system, or function; disability is a decrease in or the loss or absence of the capacity to meet personal, social, or occupational demands or to meet statutory or regulatory requirements because of an impairment. The disparity between impairment and disability can be encountered in diverse clinical scenarios. For example, a person's ability to resume occupational activities following a major cardiac event depends on medical, social, and psychological factors, but nonmedical factors appear to present the greatest impediment and many persons do not resume work despite significant improvements in functional capacity. A key requirement according to the AMA Guides is objective documentation, and the author agrees that when physicians consider the disability evaluation of people, more issues than those relating to the percentage loss of function should be considered. More study of the relationships among impairment, disability, and quality of life in patients with RSD are required.",

      "title": "Much of the Neurocognitive Impairment in Schizophrenia is Due to Factors Other Than Schizophrenia Itself: Implications for Research and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patients with schizophrenia perform worse on neuropsychological tasks than controls. While most experts ascribe poor performance to neurocognitive impairment, an emerging literature is identifying important nonspecific mediators of neurocognitive test performance, some of which can be accounted for in trials (eg, motivation, effort, defeatist performance beliefs, stress, anxiety, physical inactivity). Other factors are harder, if not impossible, to control when patients are compared to non-clinical participants (eg, hospitalization, medication effects, distraction due to positive symptoms). Effect sizes of neurocognitive performance differences are usually not adjusted for these confounders, and the level of neurocognitive impairment due to schizophrenia is thus likely exaggerated. We suggest some ways for researchers to account for the effects of these mediators. Secondary influences that negatively affect neurocognitive performance should not be treated as mere noise. They give important insight into causal mechanisms and may inform more effective treatments that go beyond cognitive remediation.",

Symptoms may be ascribed to malingering, exaggeration or poor effort on cognitive testing. The purpose of this paper is to propose that previously unconsidered factors, informed by social psychology and behavioural economics, can appear as ‘symptom magnification’ or ‘poor effort’, which are incorrectly interpreted as the result of a conscious process.

      "title": "The complex conundrum of geriatric depression and dementias",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia are clinically distinct yet interrelated disease constructs, wherein LLD can be a prodrome, risk factor, comorbidity, or consequence of MCI and dementia. There is considerable prevalence of depression in those with MCI or dementia, and vice versa, with maximum evidence in Alzheimer's disease. These intersections often form one of the most confusing aspects of psychogeriatric practice, leading to under-detection and mismanagement of depression, thus leading to incomplete recovery in most cases. This article focuses on this clinical ambiguity in daily practice, reviews the clinico-investigative pointers for the LLD–dementia intersection, and puts forward clinical and research recommendations in view of the available evidence. Although there is conflicting evidence regarding the cause–effect relationship between LLD, MCI, and dementia, it is likely that these constructs share some common pathological processes and are often associated with each other within a longitudinal clinical continuum. This is a linear yet complex bidirectional association: either the comorbid depression exaggerates preexisting cognitive deficits or chronic persistent depression eventually leads to major neurocognitive disorders, not to mention depression as a part of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which often impairs quality of life and psychosocial morbidity. Thus, a comprehensive approach, including tailored history, neuropsychiatric examination, and relevant investigations, is necessary for assessing the differentials, with a sound clinical understanding being vital to the process. Depression, if suspected, must be treated adequately with longitudinal neuropsychological reviews. Future research warrants elucidating precision biomarkers unique to these clinicopathological entities.",

Nevertheless, few studies have been dedicated to the clarification of the nature and the role of the phenomenon in this illness. Moreover, slowed psychomotor functioning is often not clearly delineated from reduced processing speed. The current, first review of all existing literature on the subject discusses the key findings. Firstly, PS is a clinically observable feature that is most frequently established by neuropsychological measures assessing speed of fine movements such as writing or tasks that require rapid fingertip manipulations or the maintenance of maximal speed over brief periods of time in manual activities. Moreover, the slowed performance on the various psychomotor measures has been demonstrated independent of medication and has also been found to be associated with negative symptoms and, to a lesser extent, with positive and depressive symptoms. Importantly, performance on the psychomotor tasks proved related to the patients' social, clinical, and functional outcomes. Several imaging studies showed slowed performance to coincide with dopaminergic striatal activity. Finally, conventional neuroleptics do not improve the patients' PS symptoms, in contrast to the atypical agents that do seem to produce modestly improving effects.",

      "title": "Fatigue is part of the burden of neuromuscular diseases",
      "abstract": "Patients with neuromuscular diseases ask relatively simple questions. They want a timely diagnosis, and information about prognosis and effects of disease on their personal functional status. With respect to treatment, patients long for a cure but most understand that they will have to reconcile to rehabilitation or even palliative treatment.\r\n\r\nWith respect to diagnosis, neurologists are trained to detect impairments, neurological signs and symptoms such as motor weakness using the MRC scale, or a Babinski sign. Also, though usually not in a structured way neurologists try to evaluate disability, such as not being able to go up the stairs or cycling. Functional status may be measured with the sickness impact profile (SIP) or the modified Rankin scale. Finally effects of disease on participation, for example not being able to work or taking part in sports, and on perceived health will be estimated. Measures of disability, participation and perceived health are increasingly being used as outcome measures in clinical trials [1].\r\n\r\nFatigue may be another underestimated symptom of neuromuscular disease [2]. That can be explained by ignorance as most patients with the exception of patients with myasthenia gravis or myotonic dystrophy do not spontaneously complain of fatigue. Many severely handicapped neuromuscular patients keep trying to participate in social life and work. In contrast, patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome have no or little objective signs and maximal decrease of participation and perceived health [2]. Yet, if fatigue would be a common additional feature of neuromuscular diseases, neurologists must be aware in order to better comprehend their patients and to develop new treatment strategies.\r\n\r\nThis issue of the Journal of Neurology contains two papers on fatigue in hereditary neuromuscular diseases. Dr. Hagemans did a cross-sectional study using a questionnaire with the Fatigue Severity Scale in 225 patients with late-onset Pompe disease [3]. About 67% had severe fatigue. Possible confounding factors were wheelchair dependency and respiratory support in about half of the patients, but 59% of patients without these aids also had severe fatigue. Previously this group investigated quality of life in lateonset Pompe patients using the SF-36 [4]. Interestingly, they found that these patients score only slightly lower than the general population on the mental health domains, making depression or decreased vitality as explanations for fatigue unlikely [3, 4]. The second paper shows that fatigue and pain can be relevant symptoms in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) [5]. Both groups suggest that fatigue is probably underreported in these slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases.\r\n\r\nSome caution with the role of confounding factors seems justified. The question whether patients with late onset Pompe disease and no respiratory aid have respiratory insufficiency that explains fatigue, can only be answered by actually measuring pulmonary function. In FSHD impaired shoulder function that is difficult to quantify, will affect quality of life and could explain fatigue.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the notion that fatigue may be part of the phenotype of neuromuscular disease is important. To my opinion, the wear and tear from having to live a life long with the consequences of a neuromuscular disease may be one explanation for fatigue. Severe fatigue will affect participation and perceived health. Neurologists must learn to measure fatigue during history taking. Neurologists can also develop interventions. For instance, it has recently been demonstrated that simple bicycle exercise training may help to decrease fatigue in patients following Guillain-Barre syndrome [6].",

      "abstract": "The clinical neuropsychologic profiles of patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with SDAT show both overlap and dissociation. Speech, language, and certain memory skills are examples of dissociable differences, especially in the early stages of the disease. Furthermore the presence of depression, evidence of cognitive slowing, and absence of aphasia in patients with Parkinson's disease suggest prominent subcortical involvement. It is probably premature to categorize all of the cognitive changes in patients with Parkinson's disease as subcortical, however. Some skills, such as visuospatial and executive functions, are impaired in both disorders, and although the etiologic bases for task failure may differ for each, this issue remains open-ended. Another problem is that often the evidence for or against the cortical/subcortical distinction is insufficient and in some cases based on a single measure thought to be representative of a given cognitive domain. Most importantly there are few comparative studies that provide unequivocal support for making a cortical/subcortical distinction. Failure to equate for level of cognitive impairment or functional disability between dementias and strict adherence to cross-sectional study designs further compromise efforts to characterize each syndrome precisely. Whitehouse suggested that a prospective study of several different dementias studied in parallel, examining a wide range of cognitive skills, is required before the cortical/subcortical classification scheme can be validated. A critical component is an autopsy program to confirm diagnoses and provide clinicopathologic correlation. It is possible that the diverse nature of the cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease is not a methodologic artifact but reflects multiple disease subtypes. Ross, Mahler, and Cummings proposed three dementia syndromes in patients with Parkinson's disease: one that is relatively mild and meets the criteria for subcortical dementia, a second that is more severe and shows a wider range of cognitive impairment but is still neuropathologically distinct from SDAT, and a third severe dementia with both subcortical and cortical involvement that may reflect basal ganglia and Alzheimer-type pathology.",

For this reason, it is important to understand pain in a broader sense as an expression of brain activity that also expresses other experiences in addition to nociception. This article describes the brain network which, according to our current understanding, generates the subjective sensation of pain. In addition to the areas of the brain that encode noxious stimuli, neuronal circuits of the limbic system, which evaluate the stimuli affectively and emotionally and are involved in response selection, are becoming important.

      "title": "Non-verbal Cognitive Dysfunction in Children with Specific Language Impairment",
      "abstract": "Background: Language deficits occur in a series of developmental disorders and are widely recognized as characteristic symptoms of a range of developmental clinical conditions. In fact, Specific Language Impairment (hereafter SLI) is currently defined as a significant impairment of the child's linguistic abilities on several levels (phonology, morphology, lexical, syntax, narrative) by the presence of non-verbal IQ scores in the normal range; the diagnosis is based on a set of inclusionary and exclusionary criteria including performance at least one standard deviation below age expectations on a generic language assessment but 'normal' non-verbal intelligence. Of course, the term 'normal' non-verbal intelligence raises issues about what constitutes a 'normal' non-verbal IQ in a-/typical development and must be handled with care. However, according to the classical definition (ICD-10-GM version 2009; F80.- 'Umschriebene Entwicklungsstorungen des Sprechens und der Sprache') a child with SLI performs below age expectations on language measures despite having adequate cognitive and sensory skills for typical development with no obvious identifiable cause such as hearing loss, brain injuries or other neurological disorders.\r\nMorphology studies of individuals with developmental language disorders claim reversed asymmetry or symmetry of the planum temporale and the pars triangularis (Wernicke's and Broca's area), yet so far there is no clear evidence that children with SLI have marked anatomical differences from other children in either brain hemisphere. Moreover, some indication suggest a possible genetic link because SLI can be passed down from parents to children - although such a SLI-gene of course hasn't been identified thus far. Hence, the investigations of etiological factors are at a premature and inconclusive stage of inquiry and so far nothing but speculative causes can be mentioned.\r\nTo sum up, current literature on SLI hardly defines a language profile as 'typical' for SLI given that the spectrum of the disorder is very broad and yet unclear since in both, academic and clinical practice, the 'specific' characteristics of this developmental impairment have been questioned. After all, the fluidity of the diagnosis, making it difficult to border SLI, should actually be considered an important descriptive aspect, portraying the interactive nature of 'specific' cognitive systems. In fact, this study is motivated by the interest in the extensive issue whether there is a relationship between language impairments and impairments on general levels of nonverbal cognitive skills, as part of the broader question of the nature of language and cognition. \r\nThus, the aim of this study is to profile a child's performance across linguistic and cognitive domains, to determine if the domains are similar or discrepant in levels of performance.\r\nMethods: 30 typically developing children and 12 children with SLI between 5;0-9;0 years were tested on both their verbal and non-verbal abilities with respectively two standardized tests each. The children with SLI were all currently in therapy and classified as 'SLI' by their speech and language pathologists. All participants were from South Tyrol or Vienna and therefore German native speakers with dialectical colouring; some had a bilingual background, this fact was of course taken into consideration while analyzing the results. To 'measure' the child's non-verbal performances level the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (parallel form) and the 'Zahlensymboltest' of the HAWIK-R was used. The Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices were used to give an indication about the child's (4;9-12;00) non-verbal performance; in each test item, a candidate is asked to identify the missing segment required to complete a larger pattern. \r\nThe verbal abilities were assessed with the German version of the standardized TROG-D (original edition by D.V.M. Bishop,1989; German by Annette V. Fox, 2006) which is used to test a child's (3;0-10;11) general linguistic and grammatical comprehension. However, some items (Set 'R') were discarded since the linguistic construction is not common in the children's dialect and therefore not recognizable by them. As a second test, the first part (forward digit span) of the 'Zahlennachsprechen' of the HAWIK-R assessed the phonological loop of the short term memory, while the second part (backward digit span) not only demands phonological memorizing but also the ability to act upon the shortly memorized item. \r\nThe test battery was reduced to these four items in order to successfully conduct the experiment without losing the child's attentiveness and interest. Each test session lasted for 20-35 minutes circa, depending on the child's accomplishment. In case the child was unable to concentrate or to carry out the given tasks, the experiment was stopped up and the results gained so far were used.\r\nResults: The preliminary results show a slight tendency towards underage-expected performance of the children diagnosed with 'SLI' in non-verbal tests compared to the control group. So far, this research alludes to a range of non-verbal cognitive mechanisms interacting with language and having its implications in delineating the profile of SLI. \r\nConclusions: Many of the studies of children with language impairments who do or do not display cognitive impairments are motivated by the interest in the broader issue of the relationship between language and cognition. The extent to which the two domains of language and general cognitive abilities are inherently singular or modular remains unresolved and controversial. However, this work has shown that to a small but noticeable extent the domains of cognition and language can operate as orthogonal dimensions.

Los trastornos del neurodesarrollo engloban a un grupo heterogeneo de trastornos como la discapacidad intelectual, el trastorno del espectro autista o los trastornos especificos del aprendizaje, entre otros. La reciente inclusion en las clasificaciones internacionales del trastorno por deficit de atencion/hiperactividad (TDAH) dentro de los trastornos del neurodesarrollo parece claramente justificada atendiendo a variables neurobiologicas y clinicas.\r\n\r\nDesarrollo. El caracter dimensional y la distribucion de diferentes sintomas en la poblacion caracterizan a la mayoria de los trastornos del neurodesarrollo. Se revisan estos aspectos, particularmente desde la sintomatologia y neuropsicologia en el TDAH. El caracter sintomatico dimensional del TDAH contrasta con los criterios diagnosticos de este trastorno de acuerdo a diferentes clasificaciones o guias clinicas. Contrasta igualmente con los datos recogidos a traves de diferentes exploraciones complementarias (escalas, tests...).\r\n\r\nConclusiones. El entendimiento del continuo clinico dentro de cada trastorno del neurodesarrollo (incluido el TDAH), entre los diferentes trastornos del neurodesarrollo, y entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la normalidad, es esencial para la investigacion, el diagnostico y el abordaje de todos ellos. El desarrollo de instrumentos que avalen este componente dimensional es igualmente trascendental.",

Although routine clinical neurological examination generally does not reveal any abnormality of sensation in persons with PD, objective abnormalities of proprioceptive function and sensorimotor integration have been demonstrated with sophisticated testing. Painful symptoms pose a considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the clinician. For diagnostic purposes, it is helpful to classify painful or unpleasant sensory symptoms into one or more of the following five categories: musculoskeletal pain, radicular or neuropathic pain, dystonia-related pain, akathitic discomfort, or primary, central parkinsonian pain. The identification of parkinsonian pain is vitally important for the effective diagnosis and treatment of pain in PD.",

      "abstract": "• Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been linked to altered neurological function following head trauma, encephalitis, abnormal birth events, and Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Abnormalities in computed tomographic scans, electroencephalograms, positron emission tomographic scans, and evoked potentials have been described in this disorder, but are neither consistent nor pathognomonic of OCD. Neurological soft signs are nonlocalizing signs of deviant performance on a motor or sensory test where no other sign of a neurological lesion is present. We studied 41 medication-free patients with OCD who met<i>DSM-III-R</i>criteria, as well as 20 normal controls, matched for age, sex, and handedness, on 20 individual tasks that involved fine motor coordination, involuntary movements, and sensory and visuospatial function. There were significantly more signs of central nervous system dysfunction in the OCD group, as shown by abnormalities in fine motor coordination, involuntary and mirror movements, and visuospatial function. An excess of findings on the left side of the body and abnormalities of cube drawing may suggest right hemispheric dysfunction in a subgroup of patients with OCD. Soft signs correlated with a severity of obsessions. There was also a correlation between abnormalities in visual memory and recognition on neuropsychological testing and total soft signs. These findings provided additional evidence for a neurological deficit in some patients with OCD. However, further comparisons with other psychiatric populations are needed to determine whether these findings are unique to OCD or are a property of other psychiatric disorders as well.",

Die Diskussion hinsichtlich der neuronalen Grundlagen zielt neben den im Vordergrund stehenden Störungen der Verarbeitungsverbindungen des präfrontalen Kortex auch auf Normabweichungen innerhalb des prämotorischen Kortex sowie subkortikale Auffälligkeiten. Die neuropsychologischen Auffälligkeiten der ADHS lassen sich zusammenfassend durch Defizite in kognitiven Kontrollprozessen charakterisieren, die Aufmerksamkeit und die höheren kognitiven Funktionen, die sogenannten Exekutivfunktionen, vermitteln. Vor dem Hintergrund der vordergründig beeinträchtigten Fähigkeit zur Aufrechterhaltung der Daueraufmerksamkeit (Vigilanz) konnte in einer eigenen experimentellen Untersuchung neben einer spezifischen Beteiligung der prämotorischen Aufmerksamkeitsfunktionen an den Fehlfunktionen der adulten ADHS ein Ausgleich einer präfrontal gelagerten und als gestört betrachteten exekutiven Funktion gezeigt werden. Wenngleich das neuropsychologische Erscheinungsbild der ADHS in seiner Komplexität zum Ausdruck gebracht wird, kann eine empfohlene Vorgehensweise zur Abklärung der klinischen Diagnose ADHS im Erwachsenenalter zusammengefasst werden.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome: The Role of Pharmacology in Understanding Its Occurrence",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially fatal adverse drug reaction characterized by an exaggerated increase in serotonergic activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It presents a constellation of signs and symptoms related to behavioral changes, neuromuscular excitability, and autonomic instability. These symptoms can occur in both mild and severe forms. SS can be triggered by the therapeutic use of a drug that increases serotonin (5-HT) availability in the synaptic cleft or by the co-administration of two or more drugs that provide this increase. With the escalating use of antidepressants by the world's population, this adverse reaction may be more recurrent. However, SS is often overlooked by patients or not diagnosed by doctors. This review aims to improve awareness about SS and provide a pharmacological perspective to explain its occurrence. Evidence shows that other neurotransmitters may also be involved with the pathology of SS. Furthermore, SS and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) seem to be part of the same pathological spectrum, especially in atypical NMS cases. The emergence of the syndrome's symptoms may be closely related to pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic polymorphisms that lead to an increase in the 5-HT available to or 5-HT signaling by specific receptors, thus constituting an important area for future investigations.",

Dementia can be the earliest manifestation of brain illness, and emerging signs of cognitive change often provide the first inkling that something is not quite right. A brief cognitive screening test is usually given by a geriatrician or neurologist and the result may be enlightening, but if the signs are subtle it may not. In any case, if the clinician suspects dementia is a possibility, a neuropsychological referral is often made to characterize any decline in cognition with comprehensive testing based on psychometric principles and with reference to robust normative data sets. The emergence of clinical neuropsychology as a mainstream specialty discipline in hospital outpatient clinics (e.g. so-called 'memory clinics') has allowed for the quantitative evaluation of cognitive decline with the kind of metric resolution which health-care professionals might reasonably expect of an empirical investigation.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that reduces the quality of life. It is associated with various psychological, behavioral, and physiological symptoms. A combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors could be traced in depression etiology. Depression affects various parts of the brain, becoming hypoactive and/or hyperactive. Various functions are impaired in depression due to the deregulated secretion of brain neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors. Moreover, it leads to immune system dysfunction and structural brain alterations. Therefore, administering proper and effective treatment for depression requires comprehensive knowledge of its underlying causes. All in all, the overview of the role of different brain areas and some of their influencing factors could be beneficial for the treatment of depression.",

      "abstract": "The definition of dual tryptophan pathways has increased the understanding of the mind-body, body-mind dichotomy. The serotonergic pathway highlights the primary (endogenous) psychiatric disorders. The up-regulation of the kynurenine pathway by physical illnesses can cause neuropathic and immunological disorders1 associated with secondary neuropsychiatric symptoms. Tryptophan and nicotinamide deficiencies fall within the protein energy malnutrition (PEM) spectrum. They can arise if the kynurenine pathway is stressed by primary or secondary inflammatory conditions and the consequent imbalance of available catabolic/anabolic substrates may adversely influence convalescent phase efficiency. The replacement of depleted or reduced NAD+ levels and other cofactors can perhaps improve the clinical management of these disorders. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM) appear to meet the criteria of a tryptophan-kynurenine pathway disorder with potential neuroimmunological sequelae. Aspects of some of the putative precipitating factors have been previously outlined.2,3 An analysis of the areas of metabolic dysfunction will focus on future directions for research and management.",

      "title": "Spinal Cord: Anatomical Overview and Selected Pathologies",
      "abstract": "Abstract The brain and the spinal cord work together to provide sensory perception and motor function to the body. These processes are accomplished by connections that occur between the brain and the peripheral nervous system through the spinal cord. Injury to the spinal cord can lead to significant deficits. Traumatic events can lead to compression, ischaemia or destruction of the spinal cord with consequential weakness, paralysis, sensory disturbances or urinary incontinence. Traumatic spinal cord injuries are classified as either complete (complete loss of motor and sensory function) or incomplete injuries (preservation of some motor or sensory function distal to the site of injury). The spinal cord can also be the site of aberrant neoplastic growth (spinal cord tumours) or immune‐modulated pathologies that lead to destruction and damage to the spinal cord (multiple sclerosis (MS)). Tumours, vascular diseases, infections, inflammatory diseases, demyelinating diseases and nutritional diseases can all result in damage to the spinal cord. Key Concepts: The vertebrae are specifically arranged to allow protection to the spinal cord as well as supporting and permitting movement of the trunk and limbs. The spinal cord is divided into distinct regions that provide innervation to different regions of the body. There are ascending sensory tracts and descending motor tracts connecting the spinal cord to the brain. These tracts are located regionally in the spinal cord according to their function, and injury to a particular region leads to symptoms that correlate with the respective function of the damaged area. Spinal cord tumours can be primary (arise from the spinal cord or its surrounding meninges) or secondary to metastatic spread. Tumours are classified according to their location relative to the dura mater, which surrounds the spinal cord. Vascular malformations result in abnormal flow of blood within the spinal cord. They often shunt blood directly between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary network. These malformations have a propensity to bleed. If an artery providing blood to the spinal cord is blocked or occluded, spinal cord infarct or stroke ensues. Pathogens in the blood can enter the central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord) and lead to infection, inflammatory response and damage to the spinal cord. Inflammatory diseases often arise idiopathically (cause unknown); some association exists between viral infections and autoimmune diseases. Demyelination of nerves and destruction of spinal cord tracts typically result and is seen in conditions such as sarcoidosis, transverse myelitis and Guillain–Barré. Autoimmune diseases result when a maladaptive immune system recognises the host tissue as foreign material and mounts an inappropriate immune response. Multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis are two disorders in which one's immune system mounts an attack against normal white matter of the CNS. Vitamin B12 is obtained through diet and is important for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath that surrounds neurons. Traumatic injury to the spinal cord most commonly occurs due to motor vehicle accidents and can lead to paraplegia (lower extremity paralysis) or quadriplegia (upper and lower extremity paralysis). An incomplete spinal cord injury is one in which some motor or sensory function is preserved distal to the level of injury. Treatment consists of realignment and stabilisation of the vertebral column, decompression of mass lesions and prevention of hypoxia and hypotension (preventing the spinal cord from being deprived of oxygen and blood nutrients).",

Underneath the umbrella of these common symptoms many invisible, unpredictable and erratic symptoms persists which complicates both the clinical presentation and the treatment. As majority of these symptoms are subjective so their true assessment on objective ground is difficult. It is important to consider that patients with MS and their care-takers should have reasonable knowledge about these symptoms because if these symptoms go unidentified or untreated then they may lead to a difficult diagnostic dilemma hence complicates further management. The frequency and severity of these unusual symptoms at times raise a suspicion of other neurological diseases. The occurrence of any of these symptoms at times may be a sign of active disease.",

      "title": "Behavioral And Psychological Symptoms In Dementia",
      "abstract": "Dementia is the colloquial term that denotes the nosological distinction of major neurocognitive disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 edition (DSM 5). Dementia refers to a collection of symptoms stemming from a broad array of etiologies precipitating in functionally impairing cognitive decline. While the presence of cognitive impairment is necessary and sufficient for a diagnosis of dementia, associated neuropsychiatric symptoms -known collectively as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, or BPSD - are prevalent and can significantly impact the prognosis and management of dementia. For this reason, DSM 5 requires clinicians to specify whether BPSD is present and to specify the degree of severity; for example, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia might be coded as “major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, with behavioral disturbances, severe.” BPSD includes emotional, perceptual, and behavioral disturbances that are similar to those seen in psychiatric disorders. It may be clinically useful to classify them into five domains: cognitive/perceptual (delusions, hallucinations), motor (e.g., pacing, wandering, repetitive movements, physical aggression), verbal (e.g., yelling, calling out, repetitive speech, verbal aggression), emotional (e.g., euphoria, depression, apathy, anxiety, irritability), and vegetative (disturbances in sleep and appetite).",

Neuromuscular diseases include neuronopathies, neuropathies, myasthenic syndromes, and myopathies. An accurate neurological examination and complementary investigations are necessary for both diagnosis and for evaluating the severity of the disease. Assessment of respiratory muscle function is a key step in deciding the need for mechanical ventilation and subsequently its weaning. Hypercapnia often indicates an impending respiratory arrest, but normocapnia, which can be seen in a patient with severe reduction in vital capacity is not reassuring. Hypoxaemia can be due to hypercapnia, pulmonary injury (atelectasis or pneumonia), or pulmonary embolism. Cardiac evaluation is important as cardiomyopathies are frequent in myopathies.",

Central nervous system hyperarousal, either as pre-existing and/or induced by psychiatric pathology and worsened by stressful events, as well as aging- and menopause-related physiological decline of sleep mechanisms appears to be at the core of this common sleep disorder. Finally, there is emerging evidence that the levels of physiologic hyperarousal are directly related to the degree of polysomnographically documented sleep disturbance in insomnia patients, suggesting that objective measures of sleep duration in insomnia may be a useful marker of the medical severity of the disorder.",

Grandiosity, rapid and pressured speech, increased energy and decreased need for sleep are also frequently seen. On the other hand, depressive symptoms are characterized by prolonged depressive mood, inhibition of thought, lowered level of activity, depressive ideas or delusions and various somatic dysfunctions such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance. Mood disorders are often seen in association with organic brain diseases, collagen diseases such as SLE, some endocrinological diseases and medication. Diagnosis of manic or depressive states is usually carried out by careful psychiatric interviews. No specific somatic symptoms or signs have been identified for manic-depressive illness.

      "abstract": "In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), abnormalities in motoneuronal excitability are seen in early pathogenesis and throughout disease progression. Fully understanding motoneuron excitability dysfunction may lead to more effective treatments. Yet decades of research have not produced consensus on the nature, role or underlying mechanisms of motoneuron excitability dysfunction in ALS. For example, contrary to Ca excitotoxicity theory, predictions of motoneuronal hyper-excitability, normal and hypo-excitability have also been seen at various disease stages and in multiple ALS lines. Accordingly, motoneuron excitability dysfunction in ALS is a disputed topic in the field. Specifically, the form (hyper, hypo or unchanged) and what role excitability dysfunction plays in the disease (pathogenic or downstream of other pathologies; neuroprotective or detrimental) are currently unclear. Although several motoneuron properties that determine cellular excitability change in the disease, some of these changes are pro-excitable, whereas others are anti-excitable, making dynamic fluctuations in overall 'net' excitability highly probable. Because various studies assess excitability via differing methods and at differing disease stages, the conflicting reports in the literature are not surprising. Hence, the overarching process of excitability degradation and motoneuron degeneration is not fully understood. Consequently, the discrepancies on motoneuron excitability dysfunction in the literature represent a substantial barrier to our understanding of the disease. Emerging studies suggest that biological variables, variations in experimental protocols, issues of rigor and sampling/analysis strategies are key factors that may underlie conflicting data in the literature. This review highlights potential confounding factors for researchers to consider and also offers ideas on avoiding pitfalls and improving robustness of data.",

This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease. These sources of diagnostic difficulty assume clinical importance when they delay the recognition of conditions that require urgent treatment.",

Case report 45 years old male patient was hospitalized at a Clinic of Psychiatry in Tuzla complaining the memory inpairment, confusion, and weakness of right arm and leg. The patient had been hospitalized at the Clinic of Neurology few months prior to actual hospitalisation. Diagnostic procedures, including MRI of the brain were done. Despite of negative tests results the diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made. During clicical observation the diagnosis of Dissociative motor disorder was postulated. Conclusion The dissociative disorders is common in clinical practice. Existence of strong secondary gain may lead to chronicity and working and social dysfunction.",

Segun el area danada, se alteraran diferentes funciones visuales, como el campo visual, percepcion del movimiento, control de la escena visual compleja, control de los movimientos corporales guiados por la vision, la atencion visual, el comportamiento influenciado por un entorno complejo y el reconocimiento de una imagen. La etiologia de la disfuncion es variada, pero esta intimamente ligado con la prematuridad. Los principales mecanismos que pueden provocar la disfuncion visual cerebral son el sindrome hemorragico-isquemico, lesiones neurologicas focales, traumatismos, hidrocefalia, infecciones, hipoglucemias neonatales, metabolopatias, malformaciones cerebrales, cromosomopatias y epilepsia. El diagnostico de esta entidad es dificil, y en muchos casos, de exclusion. Ademas de evaluar la agudeza visual, la campimetria, la sensibilidad al contraste, la motilidad ocular, la estereopsis y la morfologia del polo anterior y posterior del ojo, contamos con unos cuestionarios especialmente disenados para identificar la disfuncion visual cerebral. En nuestro estudio hemos estudiado una poblacion de nacidos pretermino a la edad de 5 anos y, tras una exploracion oftalmologica completa, hemos realizado el cuestionario a los cuidadores de los pacientes a fin de identificar una posible disfuncion visual cerebral y, a la vez, poder aconsejar ciertas medidas rehabilitadores a fin de mejorar la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

The disturbances induced constitute a psychoneurotoxic syndrome--\"a state of drunkenness\"--of about four hours duration which develops in three distinct phases. The basic mental symptoms of this syndrome consist of disturbances of the apperception, sensory perception and emotion. A moderate impairment of egofunctioning or reality appraisal and an inability to integrate different mental processes are observed. The psychomotor behavior is mainly harmonized to the prevailing emotional state and to the experiences caused by perceptual alterations, in a lesser degree. These changes, according to our observations, are more severe and more \"psychotic-like\" in schizophrenics rather than in normals. Psychopathological analysis of these changes proves that the whole syndrome cannot be considered as related to the spontaneously triggered functional psychoses or to the organic ones and, therefore, the term \"model-psychosis\" according to our opinion, is unsatisfactory.",

Their selection is highly competitive, and over the course of their service careers, they experience intensive operational training and combat deployment cycles. Yet, little is known about the health-care needs of this unique population. Method Professional consultations with over 50 special operation forces operators (and many spouses or girlfriends) over the past 6 years created a naturalistic, observational base of knowledge that allowed our team to identify a unique pattern of interrelated medical and behavioral health-care needs. Results We identified a consistent pattern of health-care difficulties within the special operation forces community that we and other special operation forces health-care providers have termed “Operator Syndrome.” This includes interrelated health and functional impairments including traumatic brain injury effects; endocrine dysfunction; sleep disturbance; obstructive sleep apnea; chronic joint/back pain, orthopedic problems, and headaches; substance abuse; depression and suicide; anger; worry, rumination, and stress reactivity; marital, family, and community dysfunction; problems with sexual health and intimacy; being “on guard” or hypervigilant; memory, concentration, and cognitive impairments; vestibular and vision impairments; challenges of the transition from military to civilian life; and common existential issues. Conclusions “Operator Syndrome” may be understood as the natural consequences of an extraordinarily high allostatic load; the accumulation of physiological, neural, and neuroendocrine responses resulting from the prolonged chronic stress; and physical demands of a career with the military special forces. Clinical research and comprehensive, intensive immersion programs are needed to meet the unique needs of this community.",

      "abstract": "Pain is both the commonest and one of the most enigmatic symptoms in medicine. Its subjective nature renders management difficult and its conceptualization is complex. Reaction to pain cannot be easily generalized; group differences are postulated, based on sex, age, culture, psychiatric diagnosis and personality variables. Early developmental aspects of pain and discussed in animal studies and case reports but little systematic data exist. Experimental findings show the influence on pain response of cognitive and emotional factors. Clinically, the variables determining perception, reporting and reaction to pain are numerous and harder to study scientifically. Acute and chronic pain should be distinguished: the latter is more complicated, leading of ten to diagnostic problems and management stalemates. Discovering the relationship of pain to emotional phenomena, as cause or effect, is difficult, though essential to effective treatment. Various frames of reference apply: e.g., individual medical, familial, and \"workmen's compensation\" models. Reaction by family, lawyer, or work commission involves potential secondary gain and may reinforce or discourage pathological responses by the patient. The potential of pain for symbolic meaning and its acceptance as a \"legitimate\" medical symptom renders it ideal for both expression and masquerading of intrapsychic and interpersonal conflicts involving anger, punishment, control and dependency. Teaching about pain and its significance is best done in clinical settings such as obstetrical units and multidisciplinary pain clinics. Videotaped modular presentations with discussion provide a satisfactory though less desirable alternative.",

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "Consciousness disorders in schizophrenia:a forgotten land for psychopathology",
      "abstract": "The scientific study of consciousness has been boosted in the last two decades, especially from philosophical and neuroscientific realms. Before that, the topic was neglected, particularly in psychiatry in which, either out-of-consciousness experiences were emphasized (as in psychoanalysis) or consciousness was viewed as epiphenomenic to the underlying organic disorders that had to be studied. This situation has hardly improved in modern psychiatry, perhaps due to the persistence of two competing metaphors of consciousness and of psychiatric constructs (such as kraepelinian dementia praecox) from which consciousness disorders were originally excluded. Accordingly, the role of a disordered consciousness in schizophrenia, which nevertheless was contemplated by Continental psychiatry, has hardly been considered by recent psychopathology research. However, there is growing data showing that certain functions that modern science considers to be part of consciousness (sense of agency, self, episodic and autobiographic memory, executive functions, insight, monitoring) could be impaired in certain schizophrenics and that this may account for symptoms such as thought insertion, depersonalisation, auditory hallucinations, self fragmentation, disorders of episodic and working memory, passive experiences and delusions of control. In this paper the conceptual history of consciousness in psychology, neurology and psychiatry is outlined, and the most prominent recent approaches to the study of its role in schizophrenia are reviewed.",

These two mutually exclusive functions are ultimately determined by theactivity of the smooth and striated musculature of the bladder, urethra, and external urethralsphincter under the control of various neural circuits in the brain and spinal cord. Although aresult of complex interplay between both the central and peripheral nervous systems, thesefunctions are also influenced by several anatomic factors such as integrity of the pelvic floorsupport and dynamic relationship of the bladder and its outlet to various points in the bonypelvis and adjacent organs during voiding. In addition, as our understanding of lower urinarytract neurophysiology grows, so grows the list of neurotransmitters and receptors identified ashaving a role in voiding function and dysfunction. Voiding dysfunction can occur as a resultof neurologic disease or injury, disturbance of anatomical relationships within the pelvis andurinary organs, or as an unwanted, often unrecognized pharmacologic effect of medicaltherapy for other diseases. Voiding dysfunction also occurs as a result of normal aging andis affected by changes in the viscoelastic properties of the bladder wall. As with otherneurologic systems, innervation of the lower urinary tract is not static; it changes inresponse to disease and aging. This phenomenon is known as neural plasticity. More oftenthan not, the etiology of voiding dysfunction is multifactorial, so a fundamental under-standing of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiologic mechanisms of the lower urinary tract isessential.",

      "title": "Сексуальные дисфункции при тревожных расстройствах",
      "abstract": "Введение. Являясь одним из широко распространенных психических заболеваний, тревожные расстройства часто сопровождаются сексуальными дисфункциями. Фармакотерапия, применяемая в лечении тревожных расстройств, в свою очередь может приводить к побочным сексуальным нарушениям. О наличии проблем в интимной сфере при обращении за психиатрической помощью сообщает лишь небольшая часть пациентов. Однако несвоевременное выявление сексуальных дисфункций может снижать приверженность терапии и ее эффективность. Материалы и методы. Статья посвящена обзору, основанному на 21 источнике, в том числе на 9 систематических обзорах и других исследованиях. Поиск данных осуществлялся по названиям, аннотациям и ключевым словам: сексуальная дисфункция, тревожное и стрессовое расстройства (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) в базах данных Elibrary и PubMed. Результаты. При тревожных расстройствах сексуальные дисфункции наблюдаются как у мужчин, так и у женщин и проявляются нарушениями всех фаз сексуальных реакций. Взаимосвязь сексуальных дисфункций с тревожными расстройствами объясняется тремя моделями. Первая, включающая причинно-следственные связи, предполагает, что корреляция между сексуальной дисфункцией и тревожными расстройствами часто является двунаправленной, причем симптомы сексуального и тревожного расстройства могут проявляться одновременно. Вторая модель предполагает наличие общего основного фактора или скрытой предиспозиции, вызывающих со временем развитие как психических, так и сексуальных расстройств, Третья модель концептуализирует сексуальные дисфункции как нарушения, не связанные с тревожными расстройствами. Заключение. На основании проведенного исследования авторами рекомендован следующий алгоритм курации пациентов, страдающих тревожными расстройствами и сексуальными нарушениями. На этапе обращения за психиатрической помощью, наряду со стандартными методами диагностики для определения выраженности психической патологии, целесообразно использовать опросники для оценки сексуальной функции. Кроме того, следует учитывать возможное негативное влияние фармакотерапии на сексуальную функцию и оценивать ее на всех этапах лечения для проведения своевременной коррекции. При выявлении сексуальных нарушений у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами с учетом клинической ситуации по возможности назначаются психотропные препараты с минимальным негативным влиянием на сексуальную функцию или без такового. При невозможности применения таких средств после достижения коррекции тревожной симптоматики могут быть снижены дозы используемых психотропных препаратов, рекомендованы перерывы в их приеме, в основном за 1-2 дня до предполагаемого сексуального контакта. При сохранении сексуальных нарушений в схему лечения в качестве антидота добавляется антидепрессант без влияния на сексуальную функцию или препараты для коррекции сексуальных нарушений – ингибиторы фосфодиэстеразы 5-го типа. Психотерапевтические мероприятия, включающие секс-терапию, являются неотъемлемой частью лечения сексуальных дисфункций у пациентов с тревожными расстройствами. Background. Anxiety disorders, being one of the widespread mental illnesses, are often accompanied by sexual dysfunctions. In turn, pharmacotherapy used in the treatment of affective disorders can lead to adverse sexual disorders. Only a small proportion of patients report having problems in the intimate sphere when seeking psychiatric help. However, untimely detection of sexual dysfunctions can reduce adherence and effectiveness of therapy. Materials and methods. The article is devoted to a review based on 21 sources, of which 9 are systematic reviews, as well as other studies. The data was searched by names, annotations and keywords: sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder (sexual dysfunction, anxiety and stress disorder) in the databases Elibrary and PubMed. Results. In anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions are observed in both men and women and are manifested by violations of all phases of sexual reactions. The relationship of sexual dysfunction with anxiety disorders is explained by three models: the first, which includes causal relationships, suggests that the correlation between sexual dysfunction and anxiety disorders is often bidirectional, and the symptoms of sexual and anxiety disorders can manifest simultaneously; The second model assumes the presence of a common underlying factor, or hidden predisposition, causing the development of both mental and sexual disorders over time; the third model conceptualizes sexual dysfunctions as disorders unrelated to anxiety disorders. Conclusion. Based on the conducted research, the authors recommended the following algorithm for the supervision of patients suffering from anxiety disorders and sexual disorders: at the stage of seeking psychiatric help, along with standard diagnostic methods to determine the severity of mental pathology, it is advisable to use questionnaires to assess sexual function. In addition, the possible negative effect of pharmacotherapy on sexual function should be taken into account and evaluated at all stages of treatment in order to carry out timely correction. If sexual disorders are detected in patients with anxiety disorders, taking into account the clinical situation, psychotropic drugs with no or minimal negative effect on sexual function are prescribed, if possible. In cases where it is impossible to use such drugs, after achieving correction of anxiety symptoms, the doses of psychotropic drugs used may be reduced, interruptions in their intake, mainly 1-2 days before the alleged sexual contact. If sexual disorders persist, an antidepressant with no effect on sexual function is added to the treatment regimen as an antidote, or drugs for correcting sexual disorders – type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Psychotherapeutic measures, including sex therapy, are an integral part of the treatment of sexual dysfunctions in patients with anxiety disorders.",

Most physical medical scientists know that gathering samples of blood, or blood pressure, or other measures must be repeated at the same time and under the same conditions every time to be able to make accurate comparisons.

Biological mechanisms of stereotypies are unknown but they seem to be related to the basal ganglia or the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits.

      "abstract": "Depressive mood, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations and behavioral disturbances have been traditionally recognized as leading symptoms of mental disorders. However, cognitive symptoms went under-recognized or declined. Today there is robust evidence that cognitive dysfunction is present in the majority of mental disorders and is also related to impairments in the functioning of the persons with mental illness. It is proposed that aberrant brain neuronal network connectivity, arising from interplay of genetic, epigenetic, developmental and environmental factors, is responsible for cognitive decline. In schizophrenia, dysfunctions in working memory, attention, processing speed, visual and verbal learning with substantial deficit in reasoning, planning, abstract thinking and problem solving have been extensively documented. Social cognition - the ability to correctly process information and use it to generate appropriate response in situations, is also impaired. The correlation of cognitive impairment with functional outcome and employment, independent living and social functioning has emphasized the need for development of the treatments specific to cognition. It is considered that brain neuroplasticity allows for re-modulating and compensating the impairment process which could give opportunity to improve cognitive functions. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive clinical assessment and follow-up of cognitive decline in mental illness. Implementation of specific treatment strategies addressing cognitive decline in mental illness, like new drugs, distinct cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, social skills training and remediation strategies should be strongly indorsed targeting recovery and reduction of disability due to mental illness.",

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> The awareness of one9s self as a unique sentient agent might be thought of as fundamental to mental health. Though disrupted in most if not all psychiatric disorders, it is the hallmark of depersonalisation disorder. This is a non-psychotic condition in which sufferers feel themselves to be “unreal” in some way and that their experience of the world is also unreal. Evidence suggests that part of the problem may be due to suppression of physiological arousal especially in response to emotion, which interrupts the experience of a vital sense of self, and that this maps on to lateral prefrontal and insula systems. Insight in neuropsychiatry may be thought of as a particular kind of self-awareness involving the appraisal and judgement on whether one9s functions or experiences are pathological in some way. A midline cortical system has been identified as critical for self-appraisal. Lack of awareness of illness or deficits has been studied in patients with for example: schizophrenia, Alzheimer9s disease and brain injury. Unawareness may apply to several domains such as social behaviour, psychopathology, memory and executive function and can be measured by different methods including discrepancy scores between patients9 own and others9 ratings. Our research has shown that patient groups with varying levels of deficit in each domain show varying levels of awareness. Low mood and executive impairment is associated with lack of insight in all groups while insight into memory deficits is closely tied to memory deficits themselves. We can conclude that insight is multidimensional and domain specific but that it also has associations, which are common across domains and disorders. The sense of self and awareness that one is ill or impaired appear to be separate phenomena and may relate to lateral and medial frontal executive systems, respectively.",

Unfortunately, the areas of life that have been ignored may be those that are most important to individuals, and may also be the most sensitive to the first signs of developing disability. The ability to perform valued life activities, the wide range of activities that individuals find meaningful or pleasurable above and beyond activities that are necessary for survival or self-sufficiency, has strong links to psychological well-being - in some cases, stronger links than functional limitations and disability in basic activities of daily living. A broader assessment of disability has great potential for interrupting the disablement and distress process, thereby improving the quality of life of individuals with arthritis. Assessment of the effects of arthritis, pain, or other chronic health conditions should expand beyond assessment of functional limitations and disability in basic activities to include assessment of disability in advanced, valued activities.",

      "title": "Endocannabinoide und andere Lipidmediatoren bei Morbus Parkinson-assoziierten Schmerzen : Untersuchung mittels Quantitativer Sensorischer Testung (QST)",
      "abstract": "Morbus Parkinson ist die zweithäufigste neurodegenerativen Erkrankung, die durch Untergang der dopaminergen Neuronen im Mesenzephalon zu einer Störung des extrapyramidalen motorischen Systems führt. Daraus resultierende Bewegungsstörungen, zu denen Rigor, Tremor, Hypokinese und posturale Instabilität gehören, werden von nichtmotorischen Symptomen wie autonome Dysregulation, veränderte sensorische Wahrnehmung, sowie kognitive und psychische Störungen begleitet. Mehrere Studien berichten über erhöhte Schmerzprävalenz bei Parkinson Patienten. Die genaue Pathogenese der gestörten Schmerzwahrnehmung bleibt unklar. Zusätzlich zu den zentralen Mechanismen entstehen die Schmerzen bei Morbus Parkinson wahrscheinlich durch eine Schädigung der peripheren somatosensorischen und autonomen Neuronen, die sich in sensorischen Defiziten, sowie in erhöhter Schmerzempfindlichkeit manifestieren. Als Korrelat dazu wurden abnormale somatosensorisch evozierte Potenziale, pathologische Ergebnisse in der quantitativen sensorischen Testung und eine Abnahme der Nervenfaserdichte beschrieben. Ein Schwerpunkt unserer Untersuchungen lag auf der Erforschung von potentiellen Veränderungen von Lipidsignalmolekülen. Eine Reihe von Studien zeigen eine Schmerzlinderung durch Cannabis-Einnahme, sowie eine Tendenz zur Schmerzentwicklung bei Parkinson Patienten mit dem bekannten FAAHPolymorphismus. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass eine Störung im Endocannabinoid-System höchstwahrscheinlich zu erhöhter Schmerzprävalenz bei Morbus Parkinson beiträgt. Eine weitere wichtige Lipid-Gruppe sind Glycosylceramide. Ihr Abbau kann durch heterozygote Mutationen des lipidabbauenden Enzyms Glukocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gestört sein. GBA1 Mutationen sind mit der schnell progredienten sporadischen Verlaufsform der Parkinson-Krankheit assoziiert. Im Rahmen der Studie wurden zwei Kohorten von Parkinson Patienten analysiert. Die 128 Patienten aus Israel wurden im ersten Teil mit 224 jungen gesunden deutschen Probanden verglichen. Im zweiten Teil wurden 50 deutschen Patienten und 50 gesunde altersgleiche Probanden untersucht. Die Schmerzevaluation erfolgte anhand der \"Brief Pain Inventory“ und \"Neuro Detect“ Fragebögen. Bei allen Probanden wurde quantitative sensorische Testung durchgeführt und die Plasmakonzentrationen der Lipidsignalmoleküle mittels quantitativer HPLC-Tandem-Massenspektrometrie analysiert. Nach Auswertung der Schmerzevaluation konnte eine erhöhte Schmerzprävalenz bei Parkinson Patienten festgestellt werden. Die Prävalenz betrug 66% im ersten Teil der Studie und 74% in der deutschen Kohorte, im Vergleich zu 40% bei den altersgleichen gesunden Probanden. Ergebnisse der quantitativen sensorischen Testung zeigen einen Verlust der thermischen Empfindung (erhöhte Schwellen) bei der gleichzeitigen mechanischen Überempfindlichkeit (erniedrigte Schwellen). In der multivariaten LipidAnalyse konnten erniedrigte Konzentrationen von Anandamid und Lysophosphatidsäure 20:4 und eine Erhöhung der Glucosylceramide nachgewiesen werden. Diese Veränderungen waren bei Parkinson Patienten mit Schmerzen stärker ausgeprägt. Außerdem wurde eine lineare Korrelation zwischen Glucosylceramiden (GlcCer 18:1, GlcCer 24:1) und der Schmerzintensität, sowie sensorischem Defizit festgestellt. Nach sorgfältiger Auswertung der Studienergebnisse kommen wir zu der Schlussfolgerung, dass eine Veränderung der Endocannabinoide und der Glucosylceramide zur Pathogenese der Schmerzen und der sensorischen Neuropathie bei Morbus Parkinson beitragen. Die Erkenntnisse könnten zukünftig zur Diagnosestellung durch frühzeitige Erkennung prämotorischer sensorischer Symptome beitragen. Darüber hinaus könnten unsere Ergebnisse zur Therapieoptimierung durch Wiederherstellung der Lipid-Homeostases beitragen.",

      "abstract": "Las hipoacusias neurosensoriales a pesar de no ser las mas frecuentes son las mas temidas por su repercusion en el desarrollo psicosocial. La entidad clinica conocida como neuropatia auditiva o audicion no sincronizada es un termino utilizado para describir a los pacientes que manifiestan deficit de la audicion, fundamentalmente en la comprension de la palabra, con unos potenciales evocados auditivos del tronco cerebral ausentes o alterados. Por el contrario, las otoemisiones acusticas y los microfonicos cocleares se registran dentro de la normalidad. En este tipo de desorden auditivo, el oido interior o coclea parece recibir los sonidos de manera normal. No obstante, las senales que salen de la coclea pueden estar desorganizadas o puede ser que el nervio auditivo no este procesando el sonido de forma adecuada. Aparentemente la afectacion auditiva compromete al nervio auditivo o a las celulas ciliadas internas y sus sinapsis, comprometiendose su sincronismo. En cambio, las celulas ciliadas externas se encuentran indemnes. Varias son las etiologias implicadas en las neuropatias auditivas, destacandose las enfermedades geneticas, adquiridas (infecciosas, toxicas y metabolicas) e idiopaticas. En este trabajo se hizo una revision en diferentes bases de datos y fuentes de informacion que permitio concluir que esta enfermedad nosologica constituye un nuevo reto para los profesionales, para lo cual es necesario a utilizar mas pruebas diagnosticas con enfasis en el  cruce de resultados para determinar el sitio de lesion. Palabras clave: hipoacusia sensorineural, neuropatia auditiva, emisiones otoacusticas, potenciales evocados auditivos de tallo cerebral ABSTRAC Auditive lost affects the language and emotional development, and the adaptation to the social and familiy enviroment. Those adverse effects can be avoided if the diagnosis, the treatment and the rehabilitation start early. Neurosensorial hypoacusias are not the most frequent ones, but they are the most feared because of their repercussion on the psycho-social development. The clinic entity known as uditive europathy (AN) or no synchronized audition is an used term to describe patients who suffer from lost of audition, mainly in the words comprehension, with the auditive evocated potentials of the brain trunk absent or abnormal, although acustic otoemissions and cochlear microphones are normal. In this type of auditive disorder, the internal ear seems to receive the sounds in a normal way. Howeever, the signals from the cochlea may be unorganized or the auditive nerve might not be processing the sounds in an adequate form. Apparently, the auditive afectation commits the auditive nerve or the internal hair cells and their synapsis, afecting their synchronism. Nevertheless, the external hair cells are harmless. Within the causes of AN, genetic causes, adquired causes (infections, toxic and metabolic causes) and idiopatic AN can be mentioned. Key words: Neurosensorial hipoacusias, Auditive Neuropathy, acustic otoemissions, auditive evocated potentials of the brain trunk.",

Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée.

Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

      "abstract": "The misidentification of a familiar person or of oneself may occur as a complication of dementia. Seven patients experienced alterations of the sense of familiarity for a familiar object or place, for the misidentified person in a novel role, for personal characteristics, or for unfamiliar events as familiar. Five of these had persecutory delusions. These cases suggest that person misidentification in dementia begins with an altered sense of familiarity for a familiar person from a mismatch of new perceptions with past memories. They are sustained by paranoid elaboration or confabulatory rationalisation of a double.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stammering (or stuttering) may be defined as an impairment of continuous utterance. Developmental stammering, regardless of country or language, affects one per cent of adult populations. Exacerbation by the stress of adult conversation or public speaking contrasts sharply with normal flow during singing, acting or conversation with children. Alterations in regional cerebral blood flow suggest that there are underlying differences in sensorimotor function in developmental stammerers whose symptoms commonly appear during the period of intensive language acquisition around the third and fourth year. Emotional tensions may exacerbate the disturbance, but equally psychological growth is adversely affected by the handicap. Abnormal motor control is confirmed by the exaggerated activity in the right hemisphere. The normal sequence of articulatory programming and motor preparation for single word reading is reversed. Absence of activation over the left auditory cortex supports the notion of impaired or diminished auditory feedback in the self-monitoring of speech seen in normal brains. Subcortical abnormalities are a feature of both developmental and acquired stammering.",

      "title": "Depressive symptoms, anxiety and cognitive impairment: emerging evidence in multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropsychiatric abnormalities may be broadly divided in two categories: disorders of mood, affect, and behavior and abnormalities affecting cognition. Among these conditions, clinical depression, anxiety and neurocognitive disorders are the most common in multiple sclerosis (MS), with a substantial impact on patients’ quality of life and adherence to treatments. Such manifestations may occur from the earliest phases of the disease but become more frequent in MS patients with a progressive disease course and more severe clinical disability. Although the pathogenesis of these neuropsychiatric manifestations has not been fully defined yet, brain structural and functional abnormalities, consistently observed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with genetic and immunologic factors, have been suggested to be key players. Even though the detrimental clinical impact of such manifestations in MS patients is a matter of crucial importance, at present, they are often overlooked in the clinical setting. Moreover, the efficacy of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches for their amelioration has been poorly investigated, with the majority of studies showing marginal or no beneficial effect of different therapeutic approaches, possibly due to the presence of multiple and heterogeneous underlying pathological mechanisms and intrinsic methodological limitations. A better evaluation of these manifestations in the clinical setting and improvements in the understanding of their pathophysiology may offer the potential to develop tools for differentiating these mechanisms in individual patients and ultimately provide a principled basis for treatment selection. This review provides an updated overview regarding the pathophysiology of the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in MS, the clinical and MRI characteristics that have been associated with mood disorders (i.e., depression and anxiety) and cognitive impairment, and the treatment approaches currently available or under investigation.",

These unexplained symptoms include functional neurological symptoms, fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome and other symptoms such as chronic pain, tinnitus and irritable bowel syndrome. Due to the absence of an aetiological framework there are currently no curing and disorder-specific treatments or medical guidelines. Here we review the evidence on an upcoming therapeutic option, non-invasive neuromodulation, as a method of treatment for functional somatic symptoms. Methods A systematic search of the literature was performed with a specific search string. The resulting hits were screened on the inclusion criteria and after full text reading a summary was made of the remaining studies. Results Neuromodulation as a treatment option for unexplained symptoms is under investigation in multiple medical disciplines. While in some symptom categories such as unexplained pain and tinnitus placebo-controlled RCT ‘s are available, case-studies or small groups are reported in other such as irritable bowel syndrome or functional neurological symptom disorder. First results are usually promising and warrant further investigation. Conclusions The literature indicates that various forms of neuromodulation yield positive therapeutic results with very infrequent side effects. The involvement and relevance of a placebo effect is discussed.",

      "title": "Padma 28 bei Restless-Legs-Syndrom: Fallberichte wecken Hoffnungen auf Wirksamkeit",
      "abstract": "Beim sogenannten Restless-Legs-Syndrom (RLS) handelt es sich um eine neurologische, sensomotorische Störung, welche sich unter anderem durch Symptome wie Gefühlsstörungen und Bewegungsdrang in den Extremitäten äussert. Meist sind die Beine stärker betroffen als die Arme, und es kann neben den Empfindungsstörungen auch zu unwillkürlichen Bewegungen der betroffenen Körperpartien kommen. Folgende vier Symptome müssen für eine klinische Diagnose des RLS vorhanden sein: - Missempfindungen mit Bewegungsdrang;- motorische Unruhe;- verstärktes Auftreten der Beschwerden in Ruhephase und sofortige Verbesserung bei Bewegung;- gehäuftes Auftreten der Symptome gegen Abend bzw. in der Nacht.Man unterscheidet zwischen einer idiopathischen und einer symptomatischen Form des RLS. Die symptomatische Form tritt gehäuft bei verschiedenen Erkrankungen wie Eisenmangel, Diabetes mellitus, Polyneuro- pathie, rheumatoide Arthritis und chronisch venöse Insuffizienz sowie auch in der Schwangerschaft auf. Weiter können Medikamente wie Dopaminantagonisten und Antidepressiva ein RLS auslösen. Die idiopathische Form wird zu 30-92% familiär vererbt, wobei ein autosomal-dominanter Erbgang angenommen wird [1].Das RLS ist eine der häufigsten neurologischen Krankheiten. Seine Prävalenz beträgt in Westeuropa und in den USA etwa 7%. Die Ausprägung der Symptome erstreckt sich über einen weiten Bereich von «kaum bemerkbar» bis «schlafraubend». Da die Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität durch stärker ausgeprägte Symptome erheblich ist (Schlafmangel, Müdigkeit, Konzentrationsschwierigkeiten), suchen viele Betroffene Rat bei medizinischen Fachpersonen.Das therapeutische Spektrum zur Behandlung des RLS umfasst neben der Behandlung der zugrunde liegenden Krankheit das Absetzen möglicher «triggernder» Medikamente, den Verzicht auf Genussdrogen am Abend (Koffein, Nikotin, Alkohol), das Lösen kognitiver Aufgaben vor dem Schlafengehen sowie physiotherapeutische Übungen. Klassische pharmakotherapeutische Massnahmen bei RLS beinhalten Levodopa, Dopaminagonisten, Antiepileptika, Antiparkinsonika und Opiate - allerdings alle mit entsprechend hohem Nebenwirkungspotenzial. Viele Patienten sind trotz des hohen Leidensdrucks nicht gewillt, sich einer solchen Therapie zu unterziehen. Die Nachfrage und der Wunsch nach alternativen Behandlungsoptionen sind deshalb gross.Padma 28 ist ein pflanzliches Arzneimittel, das in der Schweiz nach den Prinzipien der Tibetischen Medizin hergestellt wird und aus 22 Komponenten besteht. Es wird in der Schweiz von der Zusatzversicherung erstattet, das identische Präparat Padmed Circosan von der Grundversicherung.Dieses tibetische Vielstoffgemisch wird bei Parästhesien wie Kribbeln, Ameisenlaufen, Schwere- und Spannungsgefühl in den Beinen und Armen, Einschlafen von Händen und Füssen und Wadenkrämpfen eingesetzt. Diese Symptome können sowohl durch arterielle Durchblutungsstörungen als auch durch eine gestörte venöse Mikrozirkulation im Gewebe verursacht werden. Die von der Swissmedic zugelassenen Indikationen sind: Durchblutungsstörungen wie Kribbeln, Einschlafen von Händen und Füssen, Schwere- und Spannungsgefühl von Beinen und Armen, Wadenkrämpfe.Es gibt Fallberichte, die darauf schliessen lassen, dass Padma 28 bei Erkrankungen wirksam ist, die ein symptomatisches RLS begünstigen oder auslösen können. Da die jeweiligen Erkrankungen in dieser Zeitschrift schon ausführlich vorgestellt wurden, sollen diese im Folgenden nur nochmals kurz erwähnt werden.In einem Fallbericht aus einer Schweizer Allgemeinpraxis [2] wurden 2 Fälle vorgestellt, bei denen Padma 28 bei Parästhesien Linderung schaffen konnte. In einem der Fälle litt ein 68-jähriger Diabetes-Patient (Typ 1) zusätzlich auch an PAVK (periphere arterielle Verschlusskrankheit) Fontaine-Stadium IIb. Er wurde mit Insulin und zusätzlich mit Azetylsalizylsäure 100 mg/Tag behandelt. Aufgrund von Gefühlsstörungen in den Füssen und Schmerzen in den Beinen erhielt der Patient zusätzlich 3 × 2 Tabletten (die galenische Form von Padma 28 und Padmed Circosan wurde inzwischen von Tabletten auf Kapseln gewechselt)/Tag Padma 28. Nach 6 Wochen waren die Beschwerden von mittelstarker auf schwache Intensität zurückgegangen. Nach weiteren 3,5 Monaten war der Patient beschwerdefrei. Deshalb wurde die Dosierung auf 3 × 1 Tablette/Tag reduziert. In den nächsten 8 Monaten reichte diese Erhaltungsdosis aus; die Beschwerden traten nie wieder auf. Die Dosierung wurde präventiv weitergeführt.In einem weiteren Fall litt ein 57-jähriger Diabetes-Patient (Typ 2) (Metformin 1000 mg/Tag sowie Pioglitazon 30 mg/Tag) unter mittelstarken Parästhesien in den Füssen und Dysästhesien in den Händen. Auch dieser Patient erhielt 3 × 2 Tabletten/Tag Padma 28. Dank einer deutlichen Besserung der Beschwerden wurde nach 6 Wochen die Dosis auf 2 × 1 Tablette/Tag reduziert. Nach weiteren 6 Wochen war der Patient beschwerdefrei. Die Erhaltungsdosis wurde weitergeführt.Auch dieser Fallbericht stammt aus einer Schweizer Allgemeinpraxis [3]. Hier handelte es sich um eine 71-jährige Patientin, die wegen mittelstarker Ödeme im rechten Fussknöchel sowie einem subjektiven Kältegefühl in den Füssen in die Behandlung ging. Sie wünschte zur Behandlung des Ödems ein natürliches Produkt und erhielt deshalb 3 × 2 Tabletten/Tag Padma 28. Das Kältegefühl in den Füssen verschwand innerhalb einiger Tage, und schon innerhalb von weniger als 2 Wochen verbesserte sich das Ödem von mittelstark auf schwach. In den nächsten 4 Monaten nahm die Patientin das Präparat nur noch unregelmässig ein. Prompt traten die Beschwerden wieder in mittelstarker Intensität auf. Eine erneute, konsequente Einnahme von 3 × 2 Tabletten brachte die Ödeme innerhalb von 2 Wochen zum Verschwinden. Die Einnahme wurde präventiv weitergeführt; die Ödeme traten nicht mehr auf.Dieser Fallbericht stammt aus einer Allgemeinpraxis in Näfels [4]. Hier handelte es sich um einen 68-jährigen Patienten mit einer diagnostizierten Polyneuropathie (PNP). Die damit verbundenen Beschwerden bestanden schon seit etwa 30 Jahren und äusserten sich in Form von Gefühllosigkeit der Füsse bis zur Mitte der Unterschenkel, Gehschmerzen in den Unterschenkeln, Kältegefühl in den Füssen sowie einer leichten Obstipation. Der Patient klagte auch über seit 20 Jahren bestehende Einschlafstörungen. Auch dieser Patient äusserte den Wunsch nach einer Alternative zur klassischen Medizin. Deshalb wurde ihm Padma 28 in einer Dosierung von 3 × 2 Kapseln/Tag verschrieben. Aufgrund einer deutlichen Verbesserung der Symptome wurde nach 17 Behandlungswochen auf eine Erhaltungsdosis von 2 × 2 Kapseln/Tag reduziert. Die anfänglich stark ausgeprägte Gefühllosigkeit der Füsse bis zur Mitte der Unterschenkel wurde vom Patienten nach 11 Behandlungswochen noch als mittelstark und nach 21 Wochen nur noch als schwach beschrieben. Das Kältegefühl in den Füssen nahm kontinuierlich ab und war nach 21 Wochen verschwunden. Auch die Gehschmerzen in den Unterschenkeln nahmen kontinuierlich ab und waren nach 21 Wochen nur noch schwach ausgeprägt. Auch die Obstipation war nach 21 Wochen nicht mehr vorhanden. Die Einschlafprobleme waren zu diesem Zeitpunkt nur noch schwach.Die 4 vorgestellten Fallberichte geben Hinweise auf eine Wirksamkeit des tibetischen Vielstoffgemischs Padma 28 bei Diabetes-bedingten Parästhesien, bei venösen Beinbeschwerden sowie bei Polyneuropathie. Die Einnahme von Padma 28 zeigte jeweils eine ausgeprägte Abnahme der Beschwerden. Deshalb würde es sich lohnen, weitere Abklärungen durchzuführen, um die Wirksamkeit bei diesen Indikationen zu bestätigen. Weiterhin könnte sich hieraus eine mögliche Wirksamkeit von Padma 28 beim RLS ergeben, da dieses häufig im Zusammenhang mit den in diesen Fallberichten beschriebenen Beschwerden auftritt. Wegen der sehr guten Verträglichkeit von Padma 28 und dem hohen Nebenwirkungspotenzial der klassischen Medikamente zur Behandlung des RLS könnte sich Padma 28 zur wirkungsvollen Alternative in der Behandlung des RLS anbieten.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsien sind bei Patienten mit Intelligenzminderungen relativ häufig, besonders wenn die kognitiven Einschränkungen schwer oder sehr schwer sind. In Epilepsiezentren werden daher häufig auch intelligenzgeminderte Patienten behandelt. Neuropsychologische Untersuchungen sind bei dieser Patientengruppe jedoch nur eingeschränkt durchführbar, da standardisierte und normierte Instrumente für diese Patientengruppe, die 2 oder mehr Standardabweichungen unterhalb des Mittelwertes in der Normalverteilung liegen, kaum vorliegen. Gleichwohl gibt es auch für Patienten mit Epilepsie und Intelligenzminderung Fragestellungen, bei denen neuropsychologische Untersuchungen erforderlich sind. Diese beinhalten die Klassifikation einer Intelligenzminderung zur Einschätzung der Autonomie von Patienten, das Beobachten möglicher Nebenwirkungen neu eindosierter Antiepileptika oder Dosissteigerungen, die präoperative neuropsychologische Diagnostik oder die Frage einer zusätzlichen demenziellen Entwicklung. Da die zur Verfügung stehenden neuropsychologischen Instrumente diese Fragen oft nicht ausreichend beantworten können, müssen zusätzlich andere Methoden angewandt werden, um Verhaltensänderungen zu objektivieren oder das erreichte Fertigkeitenniveau zu klassifizieren. Eine Möglichkeit bietet die Erhebung der psychosozialen Anpassung an die Umweltgegebenheiten. Skalen, die das Anpassungsverhalten erfassen, liefern auch eine Annäherung an den Grad der Intelligenzminderung. Mögliche neuropsychologische Instrumente und Fremdbeurteilungsskalen zur Klärung der genannten Fragestellungen werden dargestellt und diskutiert.",

      "abstract": "Fluid and crystallized intelligence are two second-order factors that are differentiated within the intelligence model by R.B.Cattell. Fluid intelligence is considered to be a biological capacity relatively independent of environmental influences. Crystallized intelligence, however, is connected to accultured skills and knowledge. The capacity of fluid intelligence decreases by non-optimal states of general activation, functional psychosis (physically founded reversible psychosis) or defect-syndromes (physically founded irreversible psychosis). Fluid intelligence can increase by drugs only, if the functional psychosis is diminished or if the state of activation is optimized. There is no drug-effect on crystallized intelligence but an indirect influence via fluid intelligence. The hypothesis of the drug-related increase of fluid intelligence as a correlate to the diminuition accompanying the functional psychosis should be confirmed by a clinical experiment. Therefore two samples of 20 patients each with a functional psychosis following cerebral blood-flow disturbances received flunarizine (Sibelium) and placebo respectively during a double-blind study lasting 12 weeks. Under the activ substance to be applied for amelioration of peripheral and central blood-flow the measured values of fluid intelligence increased six weeks after starting therapy, while there were no changes under placebo. In the end of the investigation the measured intellectual capacity had increased by 50 per cent under flunarizine.",

Some symptoms of the disease, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, can be ameliorated with drug treatment, whereas other symptoms, such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline, remain uncontrolled. It is possible that these latter symptoms that are often termed ''negative symptoms'' are the result of anatomical and neurochemical abnormalities, whereas those symptoms of the disease such as auditory hallucinations that are termed ''positive symptoms'' may be a result of only neurochemical disorders. The drugs used to treat schizophrenia are designated neuroleptics. The term neuroleptic was chosen to emphasize the similarity of pharmacological profiles of drugs with entirely different chemical structures. Especially prominent features of the effects of neuroleptics include the following: a state of affective indifference; a decrease in locomotor activity; a decrease in excitation, agitation, and aggressiveness; and an antipsychotic action in patients with acute as well as chronic psychoses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The more important part of the assessment of any patient with dizziness or unsteadiness is the clinical history. Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

Cognitive symptoms include impairments in attention, information processing efficiency and speed, executive functions, and long-term memory. These cognitive impairments are independent of the disease’s duration and are minimally associated with neurological manifestations. Most MS patients require psychiatric treatment, usually for cognitive or affective disorders. Therapeutic management includes treatment of acute exacerbations, symptomatic treatment, and disease-modifying treatments/biological therapies. This case presentation aims to emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists when addressing the psychiatric manifestations of MS. Our patient is a 52-year-old man who presented to our clinic with suicidal ideation, a plan and method, depressive mood, multiple delusions, affective inversion towards family members, severe anxiety, and irritability, symptoms that led to significantly diminished functionality. He also presented with neurological symptoms and severe damage to the motor area. MS is a chronic, progressive disease with well-known neurological symptoms. However, the psychiatric manifestations are often overlooked. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the myelin sheath that protects nerve fibers, resulting in inflammation and damage, which eventually leads to a loss of function. The psychiatric manifestations of MS can be just as debilitating as the physical symptoms and can significantly reduce quality of life. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach between specialists in psychiatry and neurology is often necessary to provide the most appropriate medical care for patients.",

Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

A third criterion has been used, including several minor symptoms [fatigue, sleep disorders, stiff ness …] and probable FMS has been defined by two criteria out of three. These different definitions suggest that FMS is more than one disorder and that other criteria are probably needed.Conclusions: Our definition of probable or “in complete” FMS is based on the presence of spontaneous, wide spread, persistent pain, fatigue, and peripheral symptoms such as stiffness, of ten modulated by weather changes, stress, and exercise.Our definition of mechanical allodynia is based on pressure induced tendino-muscular pain [tenderness] usually associated with central symptoms such as sleep disorders [TePs syndrome].Fibromyalgia might then be defined by the association of two distinct conditions: incomplete FMS [spontaneous, diffuse pain, and fatigue], and tenderness [mechanical allodynia], both having been aggravated by physical deconditioning.",

Patients present with signs and symptoms usually associated with the motor or sensory function of the involved nerve. Careful linking of these signs and symptoms can indicate a specific compressive or painful pathology commonly known as a tunnel or canalicular syndrome, and very often known as entrapment compression neuropathy. While the names may vary, according to the compressed nerve, the anatomical area affected, the motion producing the compression or the name of the describing author, these syndromes all originate from the entrapment of the nerve elements in a narrow anatomical space. Narrowing can be caused by changes intrinsic or extrinsic to the tunnel. Patients present to their physician with symptoms that can range from vague complaints of diffuse pain or numbness to specific complaints of muscle weakness or of sensory changes over localized skin areas. A careful history and physical exam must be done prior to ordering tests, scans, or electrodiagnostic studies which should be used to confirm or clarify clinical findings. MR imaging will, with an increase in resolution and a refinement in application, be of use prior to surgical exploration. Treatment of nerve entrapment syndromes, whether conservative or surgical, must address the etiology causing nerve compression. Surgical decompression (open or endoscopic) remains the resort when conservative therapy fails. In this Symposium “Nerve entrapment” the competent authors will present the general overview, MR images and electrodiagnostic of the syndromes and especially entrapment syndromes in athletes.",

      "title": "[Productive mental disorders in post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness].",
      "abstract": "Productive mental disorders (PMD) are the result of pathological mental activity. Alongside with deficient disorders PMD are the main characteristics of post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness. PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

      "title": "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

      "abstract": "Normal function of the central nervous system (CNS) requires intact morphology as well as neurotransmission. Diseases of the CNS can become manifest as a sensorimotor deficit or psychic alteration, or both. When observing neuropsychiatric diseases, interaction of different transmitter systems is obvious. Thus, an increase or a decrease of transmitter systems affect each other. Mechanisms of compensation can also lead to alterations in transmitter systems not involved in the pathological process. Parkinson's disease, hyperkinetic movement disorders like ballism and Huntington's chorea, epilepsy and anxiety will be used in this paper as examples of the synergistic action of dopaminergic, peptidergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmission. With our knowledge of the functional balance of transmitter systems in the CNS, various pharmacological strategies have been available to intervene in the pathophysiological process. The excitatory or inhibitory quality of the transmitter systems must be considered if such strategies are to be employed. On the other hand, a functional balance between two or more transmitter systems may cause a contrary therapeutic intervention on the opposite side of the balance.",

How can other clinical conditions and mental states, besides brain damage, influence memory? Different subtypes of amnesia have different characteristics. The study of amnesia is important as a way of discriminating between memory processes and in linking deficits in remembering with specific neurological structures that are damaged. Not all memory disorders arise from organic injury or illness. ‘Psychogenic amnesia’ is usually caused by a functional impairment of memory with no tangible evidence of neurological brain injury.",

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

Appliquées au niveau du cortex préfrontal dorsolatéral (CPFDL), elles ont montré leur efficacité pour diminuer les symptômes pharmacorésistants chez les patients déprimés et chez les patients schizophrènes avec symptômes négatifs prédominants (SN). Le CPFDL est une structure cérébrale impliquée dans l’expression de ces symptômes et dans d’autres processus dysfonctionnels de ces deux pathologies comme les processus émotionnels. Le but de cette revue est d’établir s’il existe ou non un lien entre l’amélioration clinique et la modulation des processus émotionnels suite à la stimulation du CPFDL dans ces deux pathologies. Les données collectées montrent que l’amélioration des processus émotionnels n’est pas en lien avec l’amélioration clinique ni chez les patients déprimés ni chez les patients SN. Notre revue suggère que bien que partageant des structures cérébrales communes, les réseaux cérébraux impliqués dans les processus émotionnels d’une part et les symptômes dépressifs ou les SN d’autre part seraient distincts.",

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is, indeed, basically similar to the rest of medicine. it is based upon making reliable diagnoses and applying evidence - based treatments that have success rates comparable with those used in other specialties. Psychiatric syndromes may be defined as disorders that are conventionally treated with treatments used by psychiatrists. The illnesses in which psychiatrists have developed proficiency have tended to be those that either manifest with disordered psychological functioning (thinking, perception, emotion, and memory) or those which have no obviously established organic basis. However, scientific developments are showing us that these so - called psychological ailments are linked with abnormalities of the brain, just as so - called medical illnesses are deeply affected by psychological factors. Modern psychiatry is an evolving field that is becoming less hospital based, more evidence based, and more neuroscience based. Nonetheless, during the last decades, random antipsychiatry attitudes have amalgamated and turned into a conjectural effort, which has a humanistic appearance, too. On the other hand, publicized criticisms by some associates, including known psychiatrists or psychotherapists, have, radically, stirred and reinforced the movement. Anyway, though various criticisms or worries about psychiatry, either as a subdivision in science or as a clinical practice in medicine are understandable due to existing scientific or diagnostic deficits, anti-psychiatry stance, which comprises many historical exaggerations based on happenings and primitive conditions from a century ago, may help to keep us rigorous and honest about what we do and inspiring us to insistently seek better diagnostic prototypes and management standards. In the present article, the said antagonism, in addition to the existing facts and expected responsibilities of psychiatry has been discussed concisely.",

Wat beide aandoeningen gemeen hebben is dat er iets mis is in het motorische systeem, vaak veroorzaakt door veranderingen in hersenfunctie. Bij de eerste aandoening is er sprake van te veel beweging: essentiele tremor (ET). Bij deze aandoening is het ongewild trillen van de handen het meest op de voorgrond staande symptoom. Dit trillen ontstaat vaak wanneer een beweging met de hand wordt gemaakt of een houding wordt aangenomen, bijvoorbeeld drinken uit een kopje. We combineerden het meten van spieractiviteit (EMG) met het maken van hersenscans (fMRI). Op deze manier konden we de ernst van het trillen van de handen meten en dit koppelen aan de activiteit van de hersennetwerken die gelijktijdig gemeten werd. Door het innovatieve gebruik van EMG en fMRI konden we meer bewijs leveren voor verstoorde cerebellaire activiteit in ET. De tweede aandoening die wordt behandeld in dit proefschrift is functionele neurologische parese (FNP). Bij deze aandoening is er juist een gebrek aan beweging; er is sprake van krachtsverlies wat niet verklaard kan worden door structurele afwijkingen in de hersenen of door een andere neurologische aandoening. In dit proefschrift onderzochten we het repetitieve Transcraniele Magnetische Stimulatie (rTMS) als behandeling voor patienten met FNP en de verschillen in hersenactiviteit met fMRI als gevolg van de behandelingen. We concludeerden dat rTMS een potentiele therapeutische behandeling voor patienten met FNP kan zijn, maar dat er geen eenduidige verstoringen in hersennetwerken met fMRI te vinden zijn.",

Preliminary data suggest that depression may be an independent predictor of mortality in patients with PD (9). However, these affective disturbances are under-recognized and undertreated in patients with PD due to diagnostic imprecision, symptom overlap with motor and cognitive features of PD, complexity of diagnosis, health care access and resources, and under-reporting of symptoms by patients and caregivers (10-12).",

The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

In the past two decades, the advent of extensive neuropsychological test batteries that reliably assess brain function and underlying central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction has contributed significantly to our understanding of the clinical features of many neurologic and psychiatric disorders such as TS. Recent evidence has suggested that the commonly observed comorbid behavioral disorders of TS, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), clearly have an impact on cognitive, educational, and psychosocial fun~tion.',~~,'~ Moreover, these behavioral features of TS can be more debilitating than the cardinal motor features (i.e., tics) of the disorder and require careful clinical assessment so that appropriate treatment interventions can be offered to patients and their families. Current opinion regarding the treatment of TS recommends targeting the most disabling feature(s), which in many cases turn out to be ADHD and/or OCD.52 This article focuses on objective neuropsychological and behavioral assessment of OCD and ADHD, which is useful for both the clinical evaluation and treatment of OCD and ADHD associated with TS and in the research setting.",

However, the non-specificity of these symptoms, the differences in subjective feelings of patients, the influence of sociocultural factors, and the concealment of patients all pose challenges for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorders. This paper discusses the clinical characteristics of depressive disorder and the challenges faced in the diagnosis process, and puts forward coping strategies and suggestions, such as detailed medical history inquiry, comprehensive physical examination, the use of standardized rating scales, and the improvement of doctors' cognition and diagnostic ability, so as to improve the diagnostic accuracy of depressive disorder and provide patients with more accurate treatment plans.",

The second stage is characterized by reduced activity, a hunched body posture, and other behaviors. Traditionally, the second stage has been referred to as “despair” and is considered an animal model for human depression. Recent research in psychoneuroimmunology suggests an alternative hypothesis—that behaviors occurring during the second passive phase represent stress‐induced “sickness behaviors.” This perspective more readily accounts for findings in widely divergent species, does not require assumptions regarding the ability to express complex emotional states, is empirically testable, and aligns the separation model with recent hypotheses regarding the nature and ontogeny of depressive illness. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

Many of the somatic symptoms that they present with—such as pain, weakness, and fatigue—remain unexplained by identifiable disease even after extensive medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe this problem—somatisation, somatoform, abnormal illness behaviour, medically unexplained symptoms, and functional symptoms. We will use the term functional symptoms, which does not assume psychogenesis but only a disturbance in bodily functioning.\n\n### Some common functional symptoms and syndromes\n\nMost functional symptoms are transient, but a sizeable minority become persistent. Persistent symptoms are often multiple and disabling and may be described as functional syndromes. Although different medical and psychiatric classifications of functional syndromes exist, these are simply alternative ways of describing the same conditions.\n\n\n\nRene Descartes, who formulated the philosophical principle of separation of brain and mind. This has led to continuing dualism—separation of body and mind—in Western medicine and difficulty in accepting the interaction of physical and psychological factors in aetiology\n\n\n\nMedical syndromes (such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, chronic pain, and irritable bowel syndromes) highlight patterns of somatic symptoms, often in relation to particular bodily systems. Although they are useful in everyday medical practice, recent studies show there is substantial overlap between them.\n\nPsychiatric syndromes (such as anxiety, depression, and somatoform disorders) highlight psychological processes and the number of somatic symptoms irrespective of the bodily system to which they refer. Depression and anxiety often present with somatic symptoms that may resolve with effective treatment of these disorders. In other cases the appropriate psychiatric diagnostic category is a somatoform disorder.\n\nThe existence of parallel classificatory systems is confusing. Both have merits, and both are imperfect.

A committee consensus approach, including criticism from multinational expert reviewers, was used to revise the diagnostic criteria and update diagnosis and treatment recommendations, based on research results. The terminology was clarified and the diagnostic criteria and management recommendations were revised. A functional bowel disorder (FBD) is diagnosed by characteristic symptoms for at least 12 weeks during the preceding 12 months in the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation. The irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are distinguished by symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Unspecified FBD lacks criteria for the other FBDs. Diagnostic testing is individualized, depending on patient age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is defined as either the FAP syndrome, which requires at least six months of pain with poor relation to gut function and loss of daily activities, or unspecified FAP, which lacks criteria for the FAP syndrome. An organic cause for the pain must be excluded, but aspects of the patient’s pain behavior are of primary importance. Treatment of the FBDs relies upon confident diagnosis, explanation, and reassurance. Diet alteration, drug treatment, and psychotherapy may be beneficial, depending on the symptoms and psychological features.",

      "abstract": "Physical exercise offers a unique, non-pharmacological, non-invasive yet habit-strengthening, intervention that integrates different schedules/branches, whether of an endurance or resistance type, that may be ‘taylored’ for both individuals who have suffered brain trauma or healthy individuals. In any case, it presents a critical requirement for an “empowered” lifestyle. The necessity of individuals’ activity regime is linked to the assurance of normal, healthy developmental trajectories for structure and function over the complete lifespan of individuals, as evidenced from global public health physical activity guidelines. It restores the healthy homeostatic regulation of stress, cognitive-emotional affective status and the balance of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis together the amelioration or reversal of performance deficits observed in neurocognitive tasks under conditions of neurologic or psychiatric disorder. Under conditions mechanical infliction, exercise protects against vascular risk factors that include hypertension, diabetes, cellular inflammation and aortic rigidity through inducing direct changes to cerebrovasculature that involve beneficial changes in cerebral blood flow, angiogenesis and redemption from vascular disease which imply optimal brain plasticity. Essentially, physical exercise, maintained regularly even daily, may underpin the scaffolding constructions of the brain’s adaptive process by facilitating the reinforcement and reinstatement of existing networks, circuits and pathways that, although damaged, provide the substrate for reconstruction following injury [1]. For rehabilitationary measures following injuries to the brain exercise has proven useful although caution must be maintained since premature initiation of a program may aggravate symptoms and retrogress outcome [2]. A single section of exercise, independent of intensity, was found to induce a positive outcome for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, by (i) increasing positive feelings and (ii) reducing negative feelings [3]. Physical activity/exercise may ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal loss, reduce neuroinflammation, and facilitate recovery after brain injury. Brain trauma, whether mild, moderate or severe, depending on cause and severity, may be accompanied by headache, of varying intensity, dizziness, loss of consciousness, blurred vision, hearing impediment, confusion, memory loss, seizure activity, paralysis and coma as the first-noticed symptoms, with expectation of damage to blood-brain-barrier integrity, accelerated apoptosis and excitotoxicity. All of these signs and symptoms in various combinations, intensities, locations and stages will determine the extent of short-term and long-term destruction of physical, motor, cognitive, behavioral and emotional domains. Analyses of individual diagnoses from 57 studies meeting the inclusion criteria indicated that individuals presenting previous TBI showed higher odds (risk) of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, depression, mixed affective disorders, and bipolar disorder compared with to those individuals without TBI [4]. TBI may be presented as primary and secondary injury responses; the former represents immediate mechanical damge that appears at the moment of impact, and involves brain contusion, laceration, haemorrhage, axon transection and diffuse axonal injury whereas the latter, which progresses over hours, days and months, represents glutamate excitotoxicity, ionic gradient disturbances, metabolic disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species formation, neuroinflammation and hypoxic-ischenic damage [5,6]. The secondary responses naturally exacerbate the primary responses [7,8]. Physical exercise exerts multiple interventional effects upon the destructive effects of TBI that extend from anti-apoptotic effects through reinstatement of cerebrovascular integrity to augmentation of neuroplasticity at cellular, circuit, regional and behavioral levels with greater dividends arising from the proactive implementation over the reactive initiation [9]. In this regard, delaying the initiation of exercise schedules ought to be avoided since complete rest exceeding three days is less advantageous to patient recovery, gradual resumption of pre-injury activities",

      "abstract": "Recent evidence from cognitive science and neuroscience indicates that brain-damaged patients and normal subjects can exhibit nonconscious or implicit knowledge of stimuli that they fail to recollect consciously or perceive explicitly. Dissociations between implicit and explicit knowledge, which have been observed across a variety of domains, tasks, and materials, raise fundamental questions about the nature of perception, memory, and consciousness. This article provides a selective review of relevant evidence and considers such phenomena as priming and implicit memory in amnesic patients and normal subjects, perception without awareness and \"blindsight\" in patients with damage to visual cortex, and nonconscious recognition of familiar faces in patients with facial-recognition deficits (prosopagnosia). A variety of theoretical approaches to implicit/explicit dissociations are considered. One view is that all of the various dissociations can be attributed to disruption or disconnection of a common mechanism underlying conscious experience; an alternative possibility is that each dissociation requires a separate explanation in terms of domain-specific processes and systems. More generally, it is concluded that rather than reflecting the operation of affectively charged unconscious processes of the kind invoked by psychodynamic or Freudian theorists, dissociations between implicit and explicit knowledge are a natural consequence of the ordinary computations of the brain.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Olfactory Deficits by Structural Medical Imaging",
      "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction can generally be classified into (1) conductive disorders caused by interference with the access of odorants to the olfactory receptors, (2) peripheral sensorineural disbrders resulting from injury to the olfactory receptors (within the olfactory mucosa), and (3) central neural disorders of the olfactory bulb or tract or related parts of the central nervous system such as the prefrontal lobe, septal nuclei, amygdala, and temporal lobe. For medical imaging and the anatomical approach, we categorize olfactory dysfunction into two major groups: peripheral causes-sinonasal tract disorders-and central causes-intracranial disorders. It is important to relate olfactory deficits to the appropriate anatomical and pathological changes. Unfortunately, clinical olfactory testing, whether psychophysical or electrophysiological, is rarely capable of localizing the source (aside from determining whether it is on the right or left) or identifying the specific cause of decreased smell function.",

The symptoms may result from concern about a medical disorder, symptoms of pain and anxiety related to a medical disorder, or with factitious or impossible symptoms that are not consistent with any known medical disorder. Each of the following somatic symptom disorders will be described in further detail in this chapter: somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. The chapter provides a description of Dr. Martin C., a 62-year-old male who was referred for psychotherapy by his physician after seeking medical help for what Mar tin was convinced was cancer.",

A correlation has also been established between the degree of social stress and an individual's use of medical services. However, the majority of people do not respond to stress in these ways. Social supports (e.g. a caring family) seem to be an important protective factor against the effects of stress. Other mtethods of protection (meditation, relaxation response or learning specific coping skills) are also important, but have been little studied. Given their importance in preventive medicine, the author suggests that social support systems should pay an increasing part in health services.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aims The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome is essentially clinical. There are no pathognomonic criteria, but various clinical features can be suggestive of the diagnosis. We defined criteria that can help to the diagnosis. Materials and Methods A working party has validated a set of simple diagnostic criteria (Nantes criteria). Results The five essentials diagnostic criteria are: (1) Pain in the anatomical territory of the pudendal nerve. (2) Worsened by sitting. (3) The patient is not woken at night by the pain. (4) No objective sensory loss on clinical examination. (5) Positive anesthetic pudendal nerve block. Other clinical criteria can provide additional arguments in favor of the diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia. Exclusion criteria are also proposed: purely coccygeal, gluteal, or hypogastric pain, exclusively paroxysmal pain, exclusive pruritus, presence of imaging abnormalities able to explain the symptoms. Conclusion The diagnosis of pudendal neuralgia by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome is essentially clinical. There are no specific clinical signs or complementary test results of this disease. However, a combination of criteria can be suggestive of the diagnosis. Neurourol. Urodynam. 27:306–310, 2008. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric aspects of hypothyroidism and treatment reversibility. .",
      "abstract": "Thyroid hormone has important actions in the adult brain, and it is well accepted that hypothyroidism is associated with neuropsychiatric complaints and symptoms. Neuropsychiatric symptoms refer to a spectrum of emotional and cognitive problems that are directly related to changes in the brain secondary to multiple factors, including the direct effects of thyroid disease, as well as hormone deprivation in brain tissue. Hypothyroidism impacts aspects of cognitive functioning and mood. More severe hypothyroidism can mimic melancholic de-pression and dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms tend to improve with treatment and normalization to a euthyroid state, though the pattern is inconsistent and complete recovery is uncertain. The degree to which mild hypothyroidism, or subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH), impacts mood and cognitive functions and whether these symptoms respond to treatment, remains controversial. Most studies support a relationship between thyroid state and cognition, particularly slowed information processing speed, reduced efficiency in executive functions, and poor learning. Furthermore, hypo-thyroidism is associated with an increased susceptibility to depression and reductions in health-related quality of life. Controlled studies suggest that cognitive and mood symptoms improve with treatment, though the data are equivocal and limited by diverse methodologies. Functional neuroimaging data provide support for the mood and cognitive findings and treatment reversibility for both overt and SCH. These findings are not, however, without controversy. Recent investigations into the impact of SCH on cognition and mood, coupled epidemiological studies investigating the normal spectrum of thyroid stimulating hormone, have fueled significant debate regarding the appropriate, healthy range for TSH levels. This has led to concern over whether patients with overt hypothyroidism may be undertreated and whether SCH patients are truly out of the range of normal thyroid functioning and should be treated. The following is a review of the extant literature on the impact of hypothyroidism on cognition and mood, reversibility of symptoms, and treatment approaches. The spectrum of thyroid disease is reviewed, but mild, or subclinical, hypothyroidism is emphasized. The potential role of autoimmunity in neuropsychiatric symptoms and treatment resistance is addressed. Limitations of the current literature and future directions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Резюме. Диагностика пароксизмальных состояний в неврологии — одна из самых сложных проблем. Особые трудности вызывает дифференциальная диагностика эпилептических и неэпилептических пароксизмальных нарушений ввиду отсутствия абсолютно достоверных клинических маркеров заболевания в межпароксизмальный период, не всегда достаточной информативности инструментальных методов исследования и недостаточной осведомленности врачей. Неэпилептические пароксизмальные нарушения ошибочно диагностируют как эпилепсию в 20–30% случаев даже в медицинских центрах третьего уровня. Ложная положительная диагностика эпилепсии имеет место в 2–71% случаев. Двигательные нарушения, характеризующиеся внезапными преходящими эпизодами патологической непроизвольной двигательной активности, такие как хорея, атетоз, неэпилептические миоклонии, дистония, пароксизмальная дискинезия, нарушение координации произвольных двигательных актов или сочетанные нарушения координации и непроизвольной двигательной активности (пароксизмальная атаксия), представляют значительные диагностические трудности даже для высококвалифицированных специалистов. Нет абсолютно патогномоничных признаков эпилептических и неэпилептических припадков. В статье приведены основные клинические и нейрофизиологические критерии дифференциальной диагностики эпилепсии и ряда двигательных нарушений. Лечебная тактика больных с эпилептическими приступами, которые должны быть дифференцированными с пароксизмальными двигательными нарушениями, имеет ряд особенностей. После установления диагноза «эпилепсия» назначают противоэпилептические препараты широкого спектра действия, не оказывающие негативного влияния на когнитивные функции и не требующие длительного титрования дозы. В таких случаях препаратом выбора может быть леветирацетам, который эффективен при большинстве эпилептических припадков, может эффективно применяться во взрослой и детской практике, не вызывает аггравации припадков, имеет минимальные побочные действия, может быть назначен сразу в терапевтической дозе, кроме того, эффективен при ряде двигательных нарушений и при сочетании эпилепсии с двигательными нарушениями.",

      "abstract": "Los problemas de sueno son una de las quejas mas frecuentes en los pacientes que sufren fibromialgia. Aunque tradicionalmente se ha asumido que el dolor es la causa de los problemas de sueno de estas personas, las evidencias al respecto muestran que la relacion entre estas variables es mas compleja. Por una parte, diversos estudios experimentales (tanto de restriccion de sueno como de induccion de dolor durante el sueno) e investigaciones clinicas (transversales y longitudinales) sugieren que las relaciones entre sueno y dolor podrian ser bidireccionales. De esta manera, el dolor perturbaria tanto la calidad como la continuidad del sueno (ya sea en forma de despertares o en forma de arousals que aligeran el sueno y, por lo tanto, modifican la arquitectura del sueno) y un sueno de mala calidad agravaria la experiencia de dolor (al disminuir los umbrales nociceptivos). Por otra parte, existen estructuras cerebrales comunes tanto a los mecanismos asociados a la modulacion del dolor como a los asociados al funcionamiento del ciclo sueno-vigilia. Por lo tanto, es esperable la existencia de alteraciones estructurales y funcionales en el sistema nervioso central de los pacientes con fibromialgia. Este hecho sugiere que el tratamiento de los problemas de sueno podria ser un objetivo terapeutico crucial en los pacientes con fibromialgia, ya que los potenciales beneficios irian mas alla de la mejora del sueno y se relacionarian con una disminucion de la intensidad del dolor y cambios positivos en otros sintomas asociados (como pueden ser el distres psicologico, el funcionamiento diario o la ejecucion neuropsicologica). La presente tesis se ha planteado para intentar dar respuesta a varios de los interrogantes acerca de las interrelaciones que se dan entre el sueno y el dolor en pacientes con fibromialgia, intentando superar ciertas limitaciones habituales en este tipo de estudios (asociadas principalmente a una evaluacion inadecuada del sueno).",

Recognition of autonomic nervous system impairment may be critical in the timely and accurate diagnosis of various systemic disorders, and when severe, may necessitate symptomatic therapy or more aggressive treatment of the underlying systemic disease. Autonomic testing can help to objectively establish the presence of autonomic nervous system impairment, and may help to classify the nature, distribution, and severity of disease. Systemic disorders that can adversely affect autonomic dysfunction can be broadly characterized as being due to various endocrinologic, metabolic, inflammatory, infectious, or toxic disorders. The prevalence and pattern of autonomic impairment, as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to these disorders are reviewed in this chapter.",

      "abstract": "Depression and dementia can lead to generalised cognitive and memory dysfunction. Thus, differentiating these disorders is important and challenging. Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article reviews recent research that addresses the functional outcomes of intervention for vestibular disorders. Vestibular impairments cause disequilibrium, blurred vision, disorientation, and vertigo. These sensory disturbances and motor impairments in turn cause dysfunction in many activities of daily living and in social interactions that traditional medical treatments do not address. The motor sequelae of some vestibular disorders can be treated successfully with programs of graded exercises and activities, the functional implications of which are described herein. The functional impairments caused by other vestibular disorders, which cannot be treated with graded activities, are also described. These disorders include bilateral vestibular loss caused by connective tissue disorders or by the use of ototoxic medications, tumors of the labyrinth or vestibular nerve, and Meniere’s disease. Occupational therapy intervention for these conditions may involve providing adaptive equipment, teaching alternative strategies for performing activities of daily living, and psychological intervention for depression and anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a cognitive process that disrupts consciousness, identity, or memory. It is frequently used as a form of defense in response to significant stress or trauma. In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

This article reviews fundamental issues that should be considered in understanding the nature of chronic pain including the distinction between acute and chronic pain; neurobiological distinctions between the lateral and medial pain system; nociceptive versus neuropathic or other central pain; sensitization effects; the widely accepted view of chronic pain as a multidimensional subjective experience involving sensory, motivational-affective and cognitive-behavioral components; the problem of mind-body dualism; the role of psychosocial factors in the onset, maintenance, exacerbation or severity of pain; plus issues of response bias and malingering.",

Circumstances, personality and psychiatric illness may amplify (and less commonly mute) volunteered pain scores. Most pain is organically initiated and then psychologically contaminated. The psychological and psychiatric factors influencing pain scores will be considered. Patients with a propensity to somatise may elaborate and/or maintain ‘organic’ pain. This occurs ‘unconsciously’ (without awareness). This process deceives the patient (and often also the doctor). Intentional amplification of pain and the construction of pain behaviours for care‐eliciting purpose (factitious disorder) or personal gain (malingering) deceives others. Though there are clinical clues to feigned pains able to be obtained from the history and signs such as those proposed by Waddell, it is notoriously difficult to differentiate partial malingering, conversion or somatoform pain and the pain signature of the particular patient. If the intent of symptom formation and its continuance is psychological, medicine has a diagnostic role. If the intent is for personal greed or is criminal, the diagnosis rests upon legal issues.",

Entrapment neuropathies are characterized by alterations of the nerve function that are caused by mechanical or dynamic compression. It occurs because of anatomic constraints at specific locations including sites where the nerve courses through fibro-osseous or fibromuscular tunnels or penetrates a muscle. For the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies, physicians traditionally relied primarily on clinical findings and electrodiagnostic testing with electromyography. However, if further doubt exists, clinicians may ask for an additional imaging evaluation.",

Assessment of these impairments is complicated by impairments in the accuracy of self-assessment of functioning on the part of both people with schizophrenia and certain classes of informants. Many of these reports correlate close to zero with performance measured objectively by performance-based tests. Much like the phenomenon of lack of insight, unawareness of functional impairments is predicted by cognitive impairments. In addition, like other neuropsychiatric conditions and healthy individuals, mild depression is associated with increased accuracy of self-assessment. High-contact clinicians may provide reports of functioning that are more convergent with patients' ability as measured by performance-based assessments. Clinicians who are assessing deficits in cognition and everyday functioning may need to carefully consider the source of the information obtained before making treatment and placement decisions.",

The actions of new medications on the 5-HT reuptake mechanism are complemented by actions on the 5-HT receptors and on other neurotransmitter systems that may be effective in complex and treatment-resistant syndromes. New drugs acting on one or more of the seven major 5-HT receptor classes that have been identified thus far appear to be promising for the treatment of specific subtypes of psychiatric syndromes, from depression to anxiety to schizophrenia. A given serotonergic medication may be useful for more than one disorder because it acts on specific dimensions of psychobiological malfunction that characterize more than one disorder, dimensions that are mediated by more than one receptor.",

Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

Further, psychosocial problems often are addressed only superficially or not at all during office visits.

Consensus-based clinical diagnostic criteria have not yet brought diagnostic clarity. Possibly, there are dysfunctions in the processing of sensory stimuli in the \"brain-gut\" axis that may cause visceral hypersensitivity and secondary motility changes. In some patients, a multifactorial explanation of the mechanisms is useful, including stressful life events or other psychological factors. Psychiatric co-morbidity is probably the most important maintaining factor. Irritable bowel syndrome may serve as a model for the study of the interaction between biological, psychological and social factors in functional disorders.

This last symptom can be considered as an unspecific sign of brain-damage. For the disturbance of voluntary lid opening/closure, the term ,,cortical palsy\" of lid movements is proposed. Thus this symptom can be differentiated from other supranuclear disorders of lid movements where reflectory and/or spontaneous lid movements are also impaired.

Stoga je važno jasno i na vrijeme definiratipotres mozga, još u inicijalnom pregledu pacijenta i naknadno ga kao takvog dalje uvažavati kao graničnu povredu, umedikolegalnim radnjama, bilo da se ocjenjuje umanjenje opšte životne aktivnosti, postotak trajnog invaliditeta ili sposobnost povrijeđenog da adekvatno svjedoči.",

      "abstract": "DIAGNOSES/DEFINITIONS Seizures result from an abnormal paroxysmal discharge of a group of cerebral neurons. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition. Epilepsy is defined as at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart or one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years [5]. The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",
