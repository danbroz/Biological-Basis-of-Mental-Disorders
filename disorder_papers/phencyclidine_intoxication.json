Its effects are highly dose dependent and three varieties of acute intoxication have been seen clinically associated with different dosages and routes of administration. Most persons using phencyclidine smoke it sprinkled on parsley in low doses. The presence of horizontal and vertical nystagmus associated with hypertension in a patient who is agitated or comatose are diagnostic of a phencyclidine intoxicated state. Sensory isolation and intravenous administration of diazepam in the event of seizure activity have proved effective in the treatment of acute intoxicated states. Phencyclidine has pronounced behavioral toxicity and several deaths due to this agent have now been documented. It is unknown whether seizure activity or respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in pharmacological overdoses.",

Dissociative anesthetics—including phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine—are a related class of drugs that share many characteristics. Hallucinogen use is highest among young adults; MDMA is the most commonly used agent, followed by LSD and PCP. There appear to be few serious lasting complications associated with hallucinogen use. There are few data on treatment of individuals who use hallucinogens or dissociatives.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Herpes zoster, especially acute herpes zoster, is associated with the reactivation of the inactivated varicella zoster virus in individuals who have had chickenpox. PHN is associated with persistent and often refractory neuropathic pain. Patients may experience several types of pain, including deep pain, intolerable pain, burning, paroxysmal pain, stabbing pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. Pharmacological treatment of PHN may include a variety of drugs, including alpha-2 delta ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin), other anticonvulsants (carbamazepine), tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, doxepin), topical analgesics (5% lidocaine patch, capsaicin) tramadol, or other opioids. The sizeable side effect profile of commonly used oral drugs often limits their practical use, and a combination of topical and systemic agents may be required for optimal results. Doctors and other care providers must adapt treatment based on individual patient responses.",

Tendinopathy associated with drug administration has been associated with the systemic or local administration of several medications. A 90-year-old man who developed toxic tendinopathy after receiving cephalexin 500 mg twice daily has been described. Unilateral pain of his left Achilles tendon pain during walking appeared three weeks after starting the antibiotic. The drug was stopped after four weeks of treatment; within one week after discontinuing the cephalexin, all tendonitis symptoms spontaneously resolved. Drug-induced tendinopathy has most commonly been associated with fluoroquinolones, statins, glucocorticoids, and aromatase inhibitors. In addition, other systemic agents have caused tendinopathy; they include amlodipine, anabolic steroids, antiretrovirals, isotretinoin, renin-angiotensin II receptor antagonists, rituximab, and sitagliptin. Albeit less frequent, other oral antibiotics, including cephalosporins, azithromycin, and sulfonamides, have also been associated with toxic tendinopathy. Also, injections of collagenase Clostridiumhistolyticum, corticosteroids, and polidocanol have been followed by tendon rupture. The features of tendinopathy associated with drug treatment are summarized and their postulated mechanisms of pathogenesis are reviewed. The onset of tendon pain following the initiation of treatment with a new medication, especially if the agent has previously been associated with drug-induced tendonitis, tendinosis, or tendon rupture, should prompt the consideration of drug-associated toxic tendinopathy.",

      "abstract": "The utility of classical drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) is often limited by issues of lack of efficacy, delayed onset of action or side effects. Psychoactive substances have a long history of being used as tools to alter consciousness and as a gateway to approach the unknown and the divinities. These substances were initially obtained from plants and animals and more recently by chemical synthesis, and its consumption evolved toward a more recreational use, leading to drug abuse-related disorders, trafficking, and subsequent banning by the authorities. However, these substances, by modulation of certain neurochemical pathways, have been proven to have a beneficial effect on some psychiatric disorders. This evidence obtained under medically controlled conditions and often associated with psychotherapy, makes these substances an alternative to conventional medicines, to which in many cases the patient does not respond properly. Such disorders include post-traumatic stress disease and treatment-resistant depression, for which classical drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin and LSD, among others, have already been clinically tested, reporting successful outcomes. The irruption of new psychoactive substances (NPS), especially during the last decade and despite their recreational and illicit uses, has enlarged the library of substances with potential utility on these disorders. In fact, many of them were synthetized with therapeutic purposes and were withdrawn for concrete reasons (e.g., adverse effects, improper pharmacological profile). In this review we focus on the basis, existing evidence and possible use of synthetic cathinones and psychedelics (specially tryptamines) for the treatment of mental illnesses and the properties that should be found in NPS to obtain new therapeutic compounds.",

      "title": "A rare yet treatable case of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Paroxysmal dyskinesias are movement disorders that manifest with recurrent abnormal involuntary movements that are episodic. The movements can be chorea, athetosis, ballism, dystonia, or a combination of all.[1] Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is the most common type of movement disorder, and it can be primary or secondary to some illnesses and is precipitated by sudden voluntary actions.[2] The secondary causes implicated are trauma; stroke; neurosyphilis; encephalitis; multiple sclerosis; and metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and kernicterus.[3] Here, we describe a case of secondary PKD. A 32-year-old man with normal birth and developmental milestones presented with multiple episodes of dystonic posturing in the left upper and lower limbs precipitated by walking or activity for 10 years. The frequency of the episodes was 4–5 per day. There was no preceding aura, sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, tongue bite, or urinary incontinence in any of the episodes. In addition, the patient denied any premonitory urge before the attacks, and they were not suppressible. Each episode lasted 25–40 seconds and used to occur soon after patient started walking and would subside spontaneously. There was no history of gait imbalance, cognitive impairment, or cranial nerve involvement. His family history was negative for similar complaints. He was treated with multiple antiseizure medications in the past with no relief in symptoms. On examination, the mini-mental state examination score was 30/30. His general physical examination was normal. His speech, cranial nerves, power, reflexes, and sensory and cerebellar examination were normal, and he was noted to have positive Trousseau sign. He underwent video electroencephalography recording with the possibility of seizures versus movement disorder. No epileptiform discharges were detected in both ictal and interictal electroencephalography. Routine investigations, including hemogram and renal and liver function tests, were within normal limits. The corrected serum calcium level was 5.1 mg/dL (8.6–10.2 mg/dL) and phosphorus level was 5.3 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Serum ionized calcium measured during the dystonic attack was 0.8 mmol/L (1.16–1.3 mmol/L). Serum ceruloplasmin, peripheral blood film for acanthocytes, and thyroid function were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed prolonged QTc interval. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed calcifications in the bilateral caudate, putamen, thalami [Figure 1], and cerebellum. Subsequently, the intact parathyroid hormone level was 1.56 pg/mL (normal, 15–65 pg/mL) and vitamin D level was 40 ng/mL (11–42 ng/mL). He was managed with acetazolamide and high-dose calcium supplementation, following which the attacks remarkably diminished in duration and frequency at his 1-month follow up.Figure 1:: Non-contrast computed tomography head showing calcification of the bilateral basal ganglia structures and thalamiThis case is noteworthy as it remained a diagnostic dilemma for approximately 10 years. Simple investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head clinched the diagnosis. A multitude of clinical features are reported in hypoparathyroidism such as seizures, tetany, depression, psychosis, and extrapyramidal manifestations.[4,5] However, case reports of hypoparathyroidism presenting as PKD are scarce.[6-9] The involuntary movements are due to low serum calcium levels; hypocalcemia renders the neuronal membrane hyperexcitable and leads to paroxysmal dyskinesia, but why the symptoms are paroxysmal is enigmatic. The symptoms usually respond to high-dose calcium supplementation. In addition, the dystonic movements can occur in the setting of normal serum calcium levels when there are extensive calcium deposits in the basal ganglia. Perfusion abnormalities have been noted in the basal ganglia of patients with PKD. The cause of hypoparathyroidism in this patient is highly likely to be idiopathic; we did not perform any genetic testing due to financial constraints. In conclusion, we report an uncommon but easily treatable secondary cause of PKD. Investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head helped in the diagnosis, and the patient responded well to treatment.

      "title": "Stimulants",
      "abstract": "Abstract Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

Opiate abuse is often associated with benzodiazepine abuse. Hence, intravenous administration of the antagonist flumazenil is indicated in patients with suspected acute opiate intoxication resistant to naloxone. Cocaine abuse is not frequent in this country but is usually very severe and clinically heterogeneous. The clinical pattern of cocaine intoxication is initially due to excitatory and later to depressant effects on central nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems.

      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN Los 2C (popularmente conocidos como tusi o cocaína rosa) son un grupo de sustancias pertenecientes a las fenetilaminas con efecto psicoestimulante y alucinógeno. Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Comorbidities of epilepsy may significantly interfere with its treatment as diseases in the general population are also encountered in epilepsy patients and some of them even more frequently (for instance, depression, anxiety, or heart disease). Obviously, some drugs approved for other than epilepsy indications can modify the anticonvulsant activity of antiepileptics.Areas covered: This review highlights the drug-drug interactions between antiepileptics and aminophylline, some antidepressant, antiarrhythmic (class I–IV), selected antihypertensive drugs and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics (ketamine, propofol, etomidate, and alphaxalone). The data were reviewed mainly from experimental models of seizures. Whenever possible, clinical data were provided. PUBMED data base was the main search source.Expert opinion: Aminophylline generally reduced the protective activity of antiepileptics, which, to a certain degree, was consistent with scarce clinical data on methylxanthine derivatives and worse seizure control. The only antiarrhythmic with this profile of action was mexiletine when co-administered with VPA. Among antidepressants and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics, trazodone, mianserin and etomidate or alphaxalone, respectively, negatively affected the anticonvulsant action of some antiepileptic drugs. Clinical data indicate that only amoxapine, bupropion, clomipramine and maprotiline should be used with caution. Possibly, drugs reducing the anticonvulsant potential of antiepileptics should be avoided in epilepsy patients.",

In a typical scenario, a perpetrator adds a date-rape drug which has sedative effect into alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person. After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault.",

      "abstract": "Mefloquine is a clinically important antimalaria drug, which is often not well tolerated. We critically reviewed 516 published case reports of mefloquine adverse effects, to clarify the phenomenology of the harms associated with mefloquine, and to make recommendations for safer prescribing. We postulate that many of the adverse effects of mefloquine are a post-hepatic syndrome caused by primary liver damage. In some users we believe that symptomatic thyroid disturbance occurs, either independently or as a secondary consequence of the hepatocellular injury. The mefloquine syndrome presents in a variety of ways including headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, nervousness, fatigue, disorders of sleep, mood, memory and concentration, and occasionally frank psychosis. Previous liver or thyroid disease, and concurrent insults to the liver (such as from alcohol, dehydration, an oral contraceptive pill, recreational drugs, and other liver-damaging drugs) may be related to the development of severe or prolonged adverse reactions to mefloquine. We believe that people with active liver or thyroid disease should not take mefloquine, whereas those with fully resolved neuropsychiatric illness may do so safely. Mefloquine users should avoid alcohol, recreational drugs, hormonal contraception and co-medications known to cause liver damage or thyroid damage. With these caveats, we believe that mefloquine may be safely prescribed in pregnancy, and also to occupational groups who carry out safety-critical tasks. Mefloquine's adverse effects need to be investigated through a multicentre cohort study, with small controlled studies testing specific elements of the hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "Medical cannabis is increasingly used as a treatment or adjunct treatment with different levels of efficacy in several neurological disorders or related symptoms (such as multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, Tourette's syndrome, Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, headache), as well as in other medical conditions (e.g. nausea and vomiting, glaucoma, appetite stimulation, cancer, inflammatory conditions, asthma). Nevertheless, a number of neurological adverse effects from use of medical cannabis on the short- and on the longterm have been reported, in addition to other adverse health events.It has been noticed that the use of medical cannabis can lead to a paradoxical effects depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -like cannabinoids the preparation contain. Accordingly, some neurological disorders or symptoms (e.g. multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may be caused or exacerbated by the same treatment supposed to cure them. The current review presents an update of the neurological adverse effects resulting from the use of cannabis for medical purposes, highlighting the need to weigh the benefits and risks, when using cannabinoidbased treatments.",

      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

      "title": "Trihexyphenidyl Use Disorder and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic drug commonly used in treating movement disorders.[1] The widespread use of trihexyphenidyl has led to the exploration of its abuse potential due to its anxiolytic, euphoriant, hallucinogenic, and sexual stimulant effects.[2] It is a popular drug of abuse among the thrill-seeking adolescent male population, used either orally or smoked in a powdered form mixed with tobacco.[3] The prevalence of trihexyphenidyl abuse has been reported to vary from 6.5% to 34% among schizophrenia patients, with doses of trihexyphenidyl abuse varying from 28 mg/day to as high as 200 mg/day.[4] The risk factors for trihexyphenidyl abuse are male gender, unemployment, concomitant use of other illicit substances, family history of substance dependence, long-term use of trihexyphenidyl, and severe mental disorders.[4] The most common aim of abuse is anxiolysis, sedation, or a mood-enhancing euphoric effect to alleviate depressive and negative symptoms.[4] Even though trihexyphenidyl dependence has been previously described, the literature is scanty as it may mimic a primary psychiatric illness leading to misdiagnosis further compounded by a lack of awareness about the drug's abuse potential. We describe a case where prescribed trihexyphenidyl use gradually progressed to a use disorder, leading to social, financial, occupational, and biological dysfunctions. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old male with a history of possible dissociative episodes of unresponsiveness associated with anxiety, currently in remission and off all medications, presented to the psychiatry outpatient department with the inability to stop consuming trihexyphenidyl tablets. For the past 4 years, the patient has had bilateral fine hand tremors, for which tablet trihexyphenidyl was initiated for possible essential tremors, titrated to 4–5 mg per day. After 2 years of regular use, he noticed that his tremor completely resolved after the trihexyphenidyl dose and would aggravate after 4–5 h of the last dose of trihexyphenidyl, along with slurring of speech. Over the next year, the use frequency increased to more than 6–8 mg per day as the duration of relief from tremors decreased with each dose. He started experiencing other difficulties whenever the effect of trihexyphenidyl wore out, such as a generalized feeling of the slowness of movements, stiffness in body parts, difficulty walking, and difficulty in writing. Patient's writing samples, with and without consumption of trihexyphenidyl are attached in Figure 1. Simultaneously, he also noticed that trihexyphenidyl ingestion made him feel energetic, increased his self-confidence, and made him happier. He would get a high with its consumption and described it as if \"everything was possible\" for him. He took trihexyphenidyl first thing in the morning to get out of bed and start his day. He would also spend more money under the effect of trihexyphenidyl than his usual self, would at times be involved in activities that caused him financial harm, such as lending money to people recklessly and also experienced substantially increased libido. Over the next few months, he noticed that after the effects of THP waned off, he would start to experience low mood, reduced interest in carrying out activities, would feel that life is vain, had to struggle with all the movements and started to have suicidal ideations. Later, he started using trihexyphenidyl without prescription at about 10–12 mg per day in divided doses, sourcing it from his workplace pharmacy. He experienced side effects of the medication, like dry mouth, but chose to ignore it to alleviate the depressive symptoms. A representation of illness graph of the patient is given in Figure 2.Figure 1: Handwriting samples of the patient before and after taking a dose of trihexyphenidyl. The image is not reused from any source or copyrightFigure 2: Illness graph of the patient. THP: Trihexyphenidyl, TDS: thrice dailyOn examination, he had fine bilateral hand tremors, the speech was slurred, facial expressions were reduced, gait with a forward stooped posture and bradykinesia. On mental status examination, depressed affect and decreased self-esteem were present. He had taken trihexyphenidyl 4 h before this examination. Various differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out systematically. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was ruled out due to nonspecific motor symptoms and symptom onset only after trihexyphenidyl withdrawal. Drug-induced Parkinson's was ruled out as the current symptoms from the past 4 years have been without the use of any neuroleptics. Vascular Parkinsonism was ruled out due to prominent upper limb involvement and a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Wilson's disease evaluation was negative. With a provisional diagnosis of trihexyphenidyl use disorder based on tolerance, craving, and use despite harm and withdrawals, he was started on tablet escitalopram 5 mg and up-titrated to 10 mg to counter the depressive and anxiety symptoms during withdrawal; tablet propranolol 20 mg was started to manage the tremors, and trihexyphenidyl tapered slowly over 6 months. At the follow-up, he had decreased trihexyphenidyl dose gradually to 2 mg per day without any withdrawal. He maintained well without any tremors. Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication as a case report. DISCUSSION DSM 5 recognizes the antiparkinsonian drugs (including trihexyphenidyl) abuse under the \"other (or unknown) substance use disorder\" category. ICD 10 did not clarify any such category, and ICD 11 describes \"disorder due to use of other specified psychoactive substances including medications.\" However, it does not describe the classes of medications. Hence, whether nonprescription misuse of trihexyphenidyl should be regarded as psychoactive substance use is still questionable. The euphorigenic effects of trihexyphenidyl can be explained by the inhibition of dopamine reuptake and storage consequent to the strong muscarinic receptor blockade[4] as well as its increased affinity for dopamine receptors in the limbic area at higher dosages. Thus, it stimulates the central nervous reward system leading to a \"high.\"[5] Similar stimulant effects have been described with other anticholinergics, such as biperiden and procyclidine.[6] However, tolerance to these effects also develops fast, compelling the patient to increase the doses, which may lead to exaggerating its adverse effects and psychosis-like behavior alterations.[4] This anticholinergic abuse has also been associated with withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs in Parkinson's disease often markedly exacerbates Parkinsonian symptoms, movement disorders,[7] depressive or dysphoric mood symptoms, and even results in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[8] This could be due to acetylcholine receptor hypersensitivity in response to long-term anticholinergic use. The sudden anticholinergic withdrawal might worsen the severity of the symptoms than the initial presentation.[9] A similar phenomenon was observed in our patient, who developed motor symptoms following the discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl. Ruberg et al.[10] in 1982 reported increased acetylcholine receptor densities in the frontal lobes of patients on anticholinergics; similar changes are expected to be seen in nigrostriatal cholinergic receptors.[9] The hypersensitive cholinergic receptor state is similar to the cholinergic excess stage in Parkinsonism, leading to various movement dysfunctions. However, it is essential to mention that going by this mechanism of action, all anticholinergics would have an abuse potential, which is not evident. Therefore, the exact pathophysiological mechanism is yet to be elicited. An image representing possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal is given in Figure 3.Figure 3: Possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal effects. Ach: Acetylcholine, DA: Dopamine, \"rec\": ReceptorsIn this case, evidence suggesting trihexyphenidyl withdrawal-induced movement and mood disorders is the presence of a temporal relationship between trihexyphenidyl dosing and symptom onset which appears to be very similar to the \"on-off\" phenomenon seen with levodopa use in patients of Parkinson's disease. Among various management options, one study suggests tapering 1 mg of trihexyphenidyl every 2 weeks. Another deprescribing guideline by the University of Sydney and Macquarie University recommends a relatively slow tapering, reducing 25% of the daily dose in 1–4 weeks, depending on the nature and severity of withdrawal symptoms, and ending the treatment 2 weeks after giving the lowest dose. Nonpharmacological support such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, exercise, and social support should be given. If tapering is ineffective, consider switching to another anticholinergic agent, with minimal side effects. Tapering off trihexyphenidyl within 3 months of starting has been recommended.[5] Therefore, in light of such reported cases, it is essential to realize that easy affordability, availability, and prolonged prescription would lead to easy escalation of trihexyphenidyl doses leading to potential misuse among patients and this needs to be dealt with caution.

      "abstract": "In certain types of epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs can exacerbate the disease instead of improving it.This review is based on a non-systematic literature search in Medline for the time-period 1990-2007, and our own clinical experience.As a consequence of treatment with antiepileptic drugs, patients with epilepsy may have more frequent and severe seizures of the type they had before, but also new seizure types or patterns, and even series of seizures or status epilepticus. Both old and new antiepileptic drugs may exacerbate seizures, but carbamazepine-induced generalized seizures (such as absence and myoclonic) are best documented. More than one pathophysiological mechanism is probably involved in drug-related exacerbation of seizures, such as sedative and pro-convulsive effects of high serum levels, drug-associated encephalopathy, and a paradoxical pharmacodynamic effect. Accurate epilepsy- and seizure classification is important in the treatment of all types of epilepsy. Atypical absences are sometimes mistaken for complex partial seizures. Such patients may be given drugs with a narrow spectrum such as sodium channel blockers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine) or GABAergic agents (e.g. vigabatrin, tiagabine) with an increased risk of seizure exacerbation. Those at greatest risk of experiencing drug-related seizure exacerbation are learning-disabled patients, children with severe epileptic encephalopathies, those with high seizure frequency and several seizure types, and those using polytherapy.",

Patients suffering primarily from migraine or headache caused by tension are susceptible to this affect due to their massive consumption of medication. The frequent or daily intake of painkillers or migraine medication over periods of weeks or months may lead to a new type of headache characterised by dull, pressure-like and diffuse permanent pain. The appropriate therapy in this case is a withdrawal of analgesics, for which the patient needs to be hospitalised. The recovery process after hospitalisation depends heavily on the after treatment. Factors for a favourable prognosis are the length of the abuse period (less than 5 years), the use of dihydergot as a pain-killer, motivation of the patient and the support of the family and the patient's immediate environment.",

This deterioration was manifested by sudden disorientation, change in behaviour and visual hallucinations. It was only after excluding other potential causes that this presentation was attributed to the regular administration of procyclidine that was being used to counteract the extrapyramidal side effects from antipsychotics. The patient showed a dramatic improvement on stopping procyclidine. This case highlights the importance of awareness of rare adverse drug reactions and the resultant distressing effect for the patient himself.",

It is usual to associate a benzodiazepin with an opioid, more often Midazolam and Morphine or Fentanyl; other drugs as Propofol, Clonidine and Ketamine have specific indications, brief painful procedures and weaning from long periods of sedation to avoid withdrawal. Sometimes it can be useful to add a neuromuscular blocking agent to help mechanical ventilation. Adverse sedation events are relatively frequent, associated with drug overdoses and drug interactions, particularly when 3 or more drugs are used: all class of medications and all routes of administration are involved.",

The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal).

      "abstract": "BackgroundInfusion reactions may mimic drug hypersensitivity, with a spectrum of variability and heterogeneity for both individual and drug; symptoms may include anxiety, diaphoresis, rigors/chills, fever, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, headache, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing/bronchospasm, hypoxia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and death [1][2][3][4].Symptoms usually occur shortly after the infusion begins but can have delayed onset [1][2][3][4].Symptoms may decrease when the infusion rate is discontinued or slowed; at other times, the symptoms persist [1][2][3][4].To add to the complexity surrounding infusion reactions, multiple nomenclatures are used, including drugmediated hypersensitivity, infusion-related toxicity, cytokine storm, cytokine-release syndrome, anaphylactoid reaction, and serum sickness-like illness [2,[4][5][6][7][8].The spectrum of symptoms, variable onset, and the multiple names implicate the immune system.Recognizing the molecular and ontologic mayhem surrounding infusion reactions, we used software technology to investigate drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Advances in information technology allow data integration at many levels; molecular pathways can be visualized through dependency graphs and statistical modeling [9].MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) was developed by Molecular Health to connect biomolecules, pathways, targets and diseases in a drug-centric manner.Drugs highly associated with infusion reactions are reported by MASE using Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs).PRRs are calculated by the ratio of the observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs.The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) value is the PRR adjusted AbstractObjective: Infusion reactions can be serious life threatening adverse events and have been associated with many drugs and biologic agents.Our objective was to report drugs associated with infusion reactions using two different data-mining methodologies. Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurotoxic effect of medications. Antineoplastic agents and antiretroviral medications are most often involved: platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids, taxols and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. These agents cause a dose-related axonal polyneuropathy. Symptoms are indicative of a predominantly sensory or sensory-motor neuropathy which in some cases is accompanied by dysfunction of autonomic nervous system. Depending on dosage and agent used symptoms resolve completely or not. Neurotoxic effect can appear immediately during or shortly after administration of the drug but sometimes after cessation of chemotherapy. In all cases the neuropathy alters the quality of life. A general predisposition for developing a neuropathy has been observed in nerves previously damaged by diabetes mellitus, alcohol or in inherited neuropathy. Within the past five years, some cases of neuropathy caused by alpha-interferon, statins or tacrolimus have been reported. Although rare, these aetiologies should be considered by physicians and the drugs removed when others causes of neuropathy have been excluded. Few cases of peripheral neuropathy have been recently reported with metronidazole, dapsone, nitrofurantoin or colchicin. Thalidomide induces a dose-dependant sensori-motor length-dependent axonal neuropathy. It should be judiciously used with close neurologic monitorin. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the development of neuropathy. Up to now, no drug is available to prevent or cure drug-induced neuropathies.",

      "title": "CLCN2-Related Leukoencephalopathy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

Patients who choke frequently or take rapid, irregular breaths interspersed with groans or sighs need to be observed closely. Risk factors are high doses of and long-term use of antipsychotics. Clinical examination of the gag reflex and the respiration contributes very little to an unequivocal diagnosis of swallowing disorders. However, swallowing disorders can be identified reliably by means of videofluoroscopy.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

      "abstract": "Zimeldine, the first selective neuronal serotonin (5-H1) reuptake inhibitor to be registered as an antidepressant was withdrawn from common use due to an acute flu-like adverse syndrome comprising fever, myalgia and/or arthralgia and signs of disturbed liver function. A few of these patients also developed a peripheral neuropathy, in the most serious form a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The reaction was tentatively termed a hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS).Patients who had developed a HSS during zimeldine therapy (HSS-patients) were compared to control patients who tolerated the drug.No predictor to the HSS emerged concerning demographic data, psychiatric illness, previous medical history, medications with zimeldine or other drugs, other diseases, professional or nutritional circumstances. Nor was there any sign that HSS-patients who also developed neurological symptoms had a different profile of the HSS than other HSS-patients. Earlier zin1eldine treatment per se was not seen to predispose for development of a HSS or any other kind of adverse experience during subsequent therapy. The spectrum of adverse reactions was in agreement with those reported in previous studies and no new case of the GBS was revealed. The estimated frequency of HSS ranged from 0.63 to 3.4 % in spontaneous reports to the regnlatory authority and 1.4- 13% in a written inquiry. Among closely monitored inpatients 31 %developed a HSS. The mechanism for the HSS does not seem to be related primarily to the 5-HT reuptake inhibition as such. No HLA-associated disposition for the HSS was found. Nor was there any support for a HLA-associated disposition for depressive disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism for the HSS seems to involve an inlmunological response to antigens related to zimeldine.Zimeldine and its main primary metabolite norzimeldine both suppressed clinical signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats. Imrnunomodulatory effects in vitro of zimeldine, its metabolites norzimeldine and CPP 200 as well as of other monoamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants were identified in the same EAN model.These observations call for further research on immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as well as on the potential role of drugs acting on the monoamine systems in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The findings also justify a discussion on the application of immunological methods in the testing of new psychopharmacological drugs.Based on the presented results the tentatively used term for the adverse reactions to zimeldine, the hypersensitivity syndrome, seems justified.",

      "title": "The epidemiology and patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with recreational ketamine use",
      "abstract": "Ketamine was originally synthesised for use as a dissociative anaesthetic, and it remains widely used legitimately for this indication. However, there is increasing evidence of non-medical recreational use of ketamine, particularly in individuals who frequent the night-time economy. The population-level and sub-population (clubbers) prevalence of recreational use of ketamine is not known but is likely to be similar, or slightly lower than, that of other recreational drugs such as cocaine, MDMA, and amphetamine. The predominant features of acute toxicity associated with the recreational use of ketamine are neuro-behavioural abnormalities such as agitation, hallucinations, anxiety, and psychosis. Secondary to these, individuals put themselves at greater risk of physical harm/trauma. Cardiovascular features (hypertension and tachycardia) occur less frequently and the risk of death from recreational use is low and is predominately due to the physical harm/trauma. Long-term recreational use of ketamine can be associated with the development of psychological dependence and tolerance. There are reports of gastro-intestinal toxicity, particularly abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests, and of neuropsychiatric disorders, typically a schizophrenia-like syndrome, in long-term users. Finally, there are increasing reports of urological disorders, particularly haemorrhagic cystitis, associated with long-term use. The management of these problems associated with the long-term use of ketamine is largely supportive and abstinence from ongoing exposure to ketamine. In this review we will collate the available information on the epidemiology of recreational use of ketamine and describe the patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with its recreational use and the management of this toxicity.",

Though little known by medical personnel, an immediate nonallergic psychotic reaction to intramuscular procaine penicillin has been reported occasionally from many countries since 1951. Materials and Methods. A case report describes a patient whose violent behavior, provoked by this reaction, resulted in legal action taken against him. Two other nonviolent cases are presented and are followed by a review of the literature. Results. Signs and symptoms of this reaction that appears to be to the procaine component resemble a pressor response and are therefore contrary to the signs and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction. Anxiety, hallucinations, hypertension, and tachycardia are characteristic. The reaction is self‐limited. Long‐term psychologic sequelae might be averted by adequate reassurance. Conclusions. The importance of procaine penicillin as an essential drug in many parts of the world should not be diminished; however, recognition of acute nonallergic psychotic reactions is of paramount importance to assure proper patient management and to avoid misinterpretation of aggressive behavior.",

An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first.

      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "title": "An Retrospective Study of Commonly Prescribed Antiepileptic Drugs and it’s Interaction with Other Drugs which are Already in use Respect to Other Disease",
      "abstract": "Antiepileptic drugs (AED) are increasingly used in the treatment of some non-epileptic neurological diseases and psychiatric diseases. Most of the available data on the use of these agents in clinical conditions other than epilepsy are from case series, uncontrolled studies, or small randomized clinical trials, and their apparent efficacy requires confirmation in well-designed large phase III trials. Interactions between antiepileptic drugs or between antiepileptic drugs and other drugs can be pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic. Pharmacokinetic interactions include changes in absorption, distribution ,or eliminate , while pharmacodynamic interactions include synergism and antagonism at the site ,of action. Most clinically significant antiepileptic drug interactions are due to induction or inhibition of drug metabolism. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and primidone are strong inducers of cytochrome P450 and glucuronide enzymes (as well as P-glycoprotein) and may reduce the effectiveness of concomitantly administered drugs such as oral anticoagulants, calcium antagonists, antimicrobial steroids. Mechanism Oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, felbamate, rufinamide, topiramate (at doses ≥ 200 mg/day) and perampanel (at doses ≥ 8 mg/day) have weaker inducing properties and less tendency to produce interactions mediated by enzyme induction. In contrast to enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition results in decreased metabolic clearance of the affected drug, which can increase serum concentrations leading to toxic effects. Examples of important interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition include valproic-induced increases in serum concentrations of phenobarbital and lamotrigine. There are also interactions where other drugs induce or inhibit the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs. Examples include an increase in serum carbamazepine concentration due to erythromycin and a decrease in serum lamotrigine concentration due to estrogen-containing contraceptives. Pharmacodynamic interactions between antiepileptic drugs may also be clinically important. These interactions can have potentially beneficial effects, such as the combined therapeutic synergy of valproic acid and lamotrigine, or adverse effects, such as the mutual potentiation of neurotoxicity in patients treated with a combination of sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs. AEDs are also used to treat psychiatric conditions, particularly bipolar disorder. To date, the AEDs most commonly used to treat this disorder have been carbamazepine and valproic acid, which have shown manic efficacy and likely long-term mood-stabilizing effects in many bipolar patients, including those who are lithium-intolerant. . The availability of new generation AEDs has expanded treatment options for bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, and topiramate appear to show promise in the treatment of bipolar disorder, both as monotherapy and in combination with traditional mood stabilizers. In addition, newer AEDs appear to have a more favorable tolerability and drug interaction profile than older compounds, thus improving compliance",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

In contrast, time-dependent variations in pain or circadian changes in the duration of local anesthetic action only simulate the occurrence of tachyphylaxis (pseudotachyphylaxis). Tachyphylaxis appears neither to be linked to structural (ester vs amide) or pharmacological properties of the local anesthetics (short- vs long-acting) nor to technique (surface anesthesia, conduction block, spinal, caudal, or epidural anesthesia, brachial plexus block) or mode of administration (intermittent vs continuous). There is even disagreement about the clinical significance of tachyphylaxis because some authors found it in almost every patient, others less often whereas a third group did not find tachyphylaxis at all. The mechanisms underlying tachyphylaxis are open to debate. Changes in pharmacokinetics (local alterations of disposition and absorption; decrease of perineural pH) and pharmacodynamics (antagonistic effects of nucleotides or increased sodium concentration; increase in afferent input) have been implicated. None of the theoretical considerations presented are strong enough to explain tachyphylaxis. However, results from isolated nerve preparations suggest that pharmacokinetics rather than pharmacodynamics might play a role in the development of tachyphylaxis.",

      "title": "CLINICAL FINDINGS IN THE USE OF TOFRĀNIL IN DEPRESSIVE AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC STATES",
      "abstract": "1. Preliminary observation would indicate that Tofrānil is a useful drug in the treatment of depressive states. It is not a tranquilizer and, therefore, is of little value in other conditions. It is a promising drug which can be used as an anti-depressant. However, its indication and scope must be studied for a longer period to determine what symptoms respond best to it. 2. The effect of Tofrānil in many patients can be increased by the concomitant use of a tranquilizer or a stimulant. In a number of patients Tofrānil, by removing the depressive elements, frees and exaggerates anxiety. 3. It can be used in combination with electric shock or after electric shock as a maintenance dose. 4. It is of little value in the treatment of schizophrenics and in paranoid types may often aggravate the condition and break down an unstable equilibrium to which the patient has become adjusted. 5. The combined use of Tofrānil and a tranquilizer is helpful in certain psychoneurotic states, associated with anxiety or with reactive depressions. 6. It is of value in the treatment of depressions occurring in the older age group. 7. High doses are unnecessary and the effective range is somewhere between 75 and 150 mgm. per day. 8. For the most part, side effects are minimal, particularly in the younger age group. As one approaches the older age group, the frequency of such side effects increases, but usually they are more uncomfortable than serious. In patients over 60 there may be a tendency to sudden falls which occur without warning. It is recommended that in older patients the dosage be limited to 75 mgm. or less. 9. Side effects can usually be reduced in frequency or intensity by a reduction in the dosage. 10. Long-term use of the drug is apparently necessary as patients may relapse, at least in the early stages when the drug is prematurely removed. Since the drug is rapidly excreted, it is necessary to give the medication 3 times a day.",

      "title": "Behavioural Effects of Anti‐epileptic Drugs",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY There is increasing evidence that various types of behavioural disturbance, other than those described for phenytoin, for example, may occur from the use of anti‐epileptic medication, and it has been suggested that these disturbances may not always be reversible. There are suspicions also that certain groups of patients—especially those with structural brain damage—are particularly susceptible. These and other factors relevant to the study of the effects of anti‐epileptic drugs on behaviour are comprehensively reviewed. It is concluded that the psycho‐pharmacology of anti‐epileptic drugs is unsatisfactory at present because of inadequate and unsophisticated reporting of behavioural change and because of the common problem of polypharmacy, and that more accurate observations are needed on less heterogeneous groups of patients than have been described in the past. RÉSUMÉ Effets des medications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement Il devient de plus en plus évident que des types variés de troubles du comportement, autres que ceux traditionnellement attribués à la phénytoïne, par exemple, peuvent suivre l'emploi de medication anti‐épileptique; il a même été suggéré que ces troubles ne sont pas toujours réversibles. Certaines indications laissent à penser que certains groupes de malades, notamment ceux qui présentent des troubles cérébraux structuraux, sont particulièrement sensibles. Ces faits et les autres facteurs relevant d'une étude de l'action des médications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement sont systématiquement analysés. L'auteur concluent qu'à l'heure actuelle la psychopharmacologie des médications anti‐épileptiques n'est pas satisfaisante en raison de rapports inadéquats et non qualifiés sur les troubles du comportement ainsi que sur le problème commun des associations médicamenteures. Il est indispensable de disposer d'observations plus précises, de groupes de malades moins hétérogènes que ce qui a été fait dans le passé. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verhaltenseinflüsse von Antiepileptika Es gibt zunehmend Hinweise darauf, daß verschiedene Arten von Verhaltensstörungen, andere als die zum Beispiel traditionell vom Diphenylhydantoin beschriebenen, bei der Anwendung von Antiepileptika auftreten können; es wurde vermutet, daß die Störungen nicht in alien Fällen reversibel sein könnten. Es gibt weiterhin Vermutungen, daß eine bestimmte Gruppe von Patienten—besonders solche mit strukturellen Hirnschädigungen—im besonderen dafür empfänglich sind. Es wird eine umfassende Übersicht dieser und anderer, für diese Studie der Effekte antikonvulsiver Medikamente auf das Verhalten relevanter Faktoren gegeben. Es wird festgestellt, daß die Psychopharmakologie der Antikonvulsiva zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt unzureichend ist, da adäquate und sorgfältige Berichte über Verhaltensanderungen und die allgemeinen Probleme der Polypharmazie fehlen; es werden genauere Beobachtungen an weniger heterogenen Patientengruppen benötigt, als sie bisher beschrieben sind. RESUMEN Efectos sobre la conducta de los fármacos antiepilépticos Hay una evidencia creciente de que diversos tipos de alteraciones en el comportamiento, además de los ya tradicionalmente descritos para la fenitoína por ejemplo, pueden aparecer por el uso de medicación antiepiléptica, y se ha sugerido que estas alteraciones no siempre pueden ser reversibles. Hay sospechas también de que algunos grupos de pacientes, especialmente aquellos con lesión estructural cerebral, sen particularmente susceptibles. Se revisan de forma complet estos y otros factores en relación con el estudio de los efectos de los fármacos antiepilépticos sobre el comportamiento. Se concluye que la psicofarmacología de los fármacos antiepilépticos no es satisfactoria en el momento presente debido a unas comunicaciones inadecuadas o no sofisticadas sobre los cambios del comportamiento y el problema común de la polifarmacia, y que es necesaria una observación más atenta en grupos de pacientes menos heterogéneos de los que han sido descritos en el pasado.",

To avoid discontinuation of medication, recurrence of psychosis, and rehospitalization, a longer acting psychotropic compound was needed, similar to depot insulin used in diabetes, and the development of such a compound among the phenothiazines was encouraged.",

      "abstract": "A total of 320 newly admitted schizophrenic men were randomly assigned to either an aliphatic, piperidine, or piperazine phenothiazine. Physicians chose drugs within the class assigned and used them to maximal clinical advantage. None of the drug classes was superior to another in total efficacy. Finer differences were that piperazines were more effective in patients who were older and who were categorized as having \"core\" or \"nonparanoid\" types of schizophrenia, characterized chiefly by thought disorders. The prevailing belief that these drugs are more specific antipsychotic agents was given some support. Past difficulties in replicating specific indications for antipsychotic drugs, as well as the few differences found in this study, force the clinician still to choose drugs empirically. Differing reactions of individual patients to various drugs are more likely due to differences in drug kinetics than to any important pharmacological differences.",

      "title": "Third Generation Antipsychotic Drugs: Partial Agonism or Receptor Functional Selectivity?",
      "abstract": "Functional selectivity is the term that describes drugs that cause markedly different signaling through a single receptor (e.g., full agonist at one pathway and antagonist at a second). It has been widely recognized recently that this phenomenon impacts the understanding of mechanism of action of some drugs, and has relevance to drug discovery. One of the clinical areas where this mechanism has particular importance is in the treatment of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs have been grouped according to both pattern of clinical action and mechanism of action. The original antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been called typical or first generation. They cause both antipsychotic actions and many side effects (extrapyramidal and endocrine) that are ascribed to their high affinity dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism. Drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and others were then developed that avoided the neurological side effects (atypical or second generation antipsychotics). These compounds are divided mechanistically into those that are high affinity D(2) and 5-HT(2A) antagonists, and those that also bind with modest affinity to D(2), 5-HT(2A), and many other neuroreceptors. There is one approved third generation drug, aripiprazole, whose actions have been ascribed alternately to either D(2) partial agonism or D(2) functional selectivity. Although partial agonism has been the more widely accepted mechanism, the available data are inconsistent with this mechanism. Conversely, the D(2) functional selectivity hypothesis can accommodate all current data for aripiprazole, and also impacts on discovery compounds that are not pure D(2) antagonists.",

ME describes a syndrome where there is general muscle pain associated with evidence of a disturbed nervous system [2]. ME, commonly referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or post-viral fatigue syndrome is a condition in which mental and physical fatigue predominate. It is characterized by gross abnormal muscle fatigue which occurs after relatively mild activity. Other symptoms regularly complained of include sleep disturbance, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, feeling depressed, bouts of low grade fever (not exceeding 38-6°C), increased sensitivity to light, back and neck pain, sore throat, irritable bowel and bladder [3]. The symptoms of ME typically become apparent following a viral infection [4], although other trigger factors have been noted. Vaccinations against cholera, tetanus, typhoid and influenza have been associated with the onset of ME [5]. It has also been observed that any psychological disturbances in ME occur secondary to, or share a common pathophysiology with an immunological dysfunction [6]. In many cases there appears to be no apparent triggering factor [7].",

In this regard, convulsant drugs may either increase excitatory neurotransmission or conversely, decrease inhibitory neurotransmission within the brain. Penicillin has been found to have a direct, dose-dependent convulsant effect in several animal species and has been used as an experimental model for multifocal and generalized epilepsie. Risk factors for penicillin-induced seizures in man include the specific penicillin derivative, dose, renal function, route, and schedule of administration. Antidepressant agents are a commonly prescribed class of drugs with a wide range of adverse effects, both in therapeutic and toxic doses.

DP may be secondary to many medical conditions, including neurological (head injury, infections, tumours, multiple infarcts), endocrine (thyroid dysfunction, diabetes mellitus), haematological (leukaemia, severe anaemia) and cardiopulmonary (congestive heart failure, asthma) conditions; systemic infections (HIV, tuberculosis, leprosy); malignancies (lymphomas, tumours of breast, lung, colon); nutritional deficiencies (vitamin B12, folate, thiamine); and a miscellaneous category (arthritis, hepatitis, vitiligo). Drugs or toxins that have been implicated include alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, corticosteroids and ketoconazole. 1",

Associated symptoms: nausea, vomiting, fullness of ears, hearing loss, tinnitus, all of which suggest otological etiologies; headaches, diplopia, blurred vision, ataxia, paresthesia, all suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) etiologies.

Of a group of 575 schizophrenics under my care, and all on phenothiazine therapy, 26 are thought to have shown such exacerbations, which abated on stopping simultaneously taking a sympathomimetic material. This number is likely an understatement, because many of the events were not recognized because of our only recent appreciation of this matter.

No attempt was made to determine the necessity for adding the anti-Parkinson drug when the tranquilizer was changed, though Kruse(4) reports that \"these reactions . . . were always controllable\" by anti-Parkinson drugs alone. 3. Akathisia is a syndrome which occurs during the administration of high doses of tranquilizing drugs. Whenever a patient fails to respond to the administration of high doses of these medicines or when he seems to have a paradoxical effect from them, the possibility of akathisia should be considered and appropriate treatment instituted. 4. Appropriate treatment of the condition appears to be, at this time, a reduction or change in the tranquilizing drugs used, plus the addition of an anti-Parkinson drug such as Cogentin, Pagitane, or Kemadrin.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "title": "Concurrent medication and the neuromuscular junction",
      "abstract": "Introduction Many patients present for anaesthesia with disease processes that may be associated with or unrelated to the surgical condition. Epilepsy, bronchial asthma, peptic ulcer, manic and depressive illness, angina pectoris and essential hypertension are common in any population group. Such patients are often on medications for prolonged periods. Furthermore, antibiotics, diuretics, corticosteroids and immuno-suppressants are in frequent use and are often required as a part of the surgical procedure. The administration of anaesthesia may require the use of muscle relaxants. Concurrent medication has the potential to interfere with neuromuscular function and thus create an unexpected response to muscle relaxants. The effects of long-term medications on the neuromuscular junction and the possible effects on the action of muscle relaxants are discussed in this review according to their site of action (see Table 1). We have not considered the effects of drugs administered to produce the anaesthetic state (e.g. inhalational anaesthetics or local anaesthetic agents) or medications used for acute interventions during anaesthesia or surgery (e.g. sympathomimetic amines or ion exchange resins), which may also produce effects at the neuromuscular junction.Table 1: Sites of alteration of neuromuscular function by to concurrent medication Prejunctional effects, cAMP production Aminophylline Large doses of pancuronium (5 mg h−1) were required to stop spontaneous respiratory efforts and terminate restlessness in a 17-year-old male with bronchial asthma receiving large doses of aminophylline and corticosteroids. The authors speculated that aminophylline, which is a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, raised the level of cAMP, which in turn raised the amount of ACh at the neuromuscular junction, thus antagonizing the blocking effect of pancuronium [1]. Evidence for a prejunctional role of cyclic nucleotides in neuromuscular transmission was suggested by Dretchen and colleagues in 1976 [2]. It is likely that patients receiving prolonged aminophylline therapy in the upper therapeutic range may show an impaired response to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. This abnormal response has not been quantified, however, with respect to doses or durations of therapy for these agents. Azathioprine In concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 μg kg−1, administered intra-arterially in the in vivo cat soleus muscle preparation, azathioprine caused motor axons to fire repetitively and produced a dose-related increase in the force of contraction. Azathioprine reversed a neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine and potentiated a neuromuscular block produced by suxamethonium. It was concluded that the effects of azathioprine on neuromuscular transmission result from inhibition of phosphodiesterase in the motor nerve terminal [3]. Diuretics Diuretics, in particular frusemide, have differing effects on non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. At low doses(0.1-10 μg kg−1), frusemide had a depressant effect, reducing the force of muscle contraction and intensifying the neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine and suxamethonium in an in vitro rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation and an in vivo soleus nerve muscle preparation [4]. In contrast, higher doses(1-4 mg kg−1) antagonized a tubocurarine and suxamethonium block. High doses of frusemide inhibit non-competitively both the high- and the low-affinity forms of phosphodiesterase in both soluble and particulate fractions of cat sciatic nerve. This leads to an increase in the amount of ACh at the neuromuscular junction. Loss of potassium induced by thiazide diuretics may be important. Hypokalaemia produces increased sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, although it is the ratio of intra- to extracellular potassium that is important and not the absolute value of either. The cell membrane becomes hyperpolarized, and there is resistance to the action of ACh. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are potentiated, and depolarizers may be antagonized [5]. Low doses of frusemide and thiazide diuretics are likely to potentiate the block produced by non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, whereas high doses of frusemide may antagonize a non-depolarizing block. Aminoglycoside antibiotics The anaesthetist frequently encounters patients on prophylactic antibiotics and often administers antibiotics in the perioperative period [6]. Several antibiotics have been shown to enhance the neuromuscular block produced by non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents [7]. Prominent among these are the aminoglycosides. All the aminoglycosides are capable of causing neuromuscular block and alone result in paralysis. The mechanism appears to involve inhibition of calcium uptake, which results in both reduction in presynaptic ACh release and block of post-synaptic ACh receptors [8]. The aminoglycosides differ in their presynaptic and postsynaptic effects [9, 10]. The effects of seven antibiotics (streptomycin, amikacin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline) were compared with those of Mg2+, tubocurarine and lignocaine in the frog sciatic nerve-sartorius muscle preparation [11]. All except tubocurarine decreased end-plate potential quantal content. Neomycin is capable of producing respiratory arrest by blocking neuromuscular transmission by a presynaptic mechanism [12]. Aminoglycosides have prejunctional effects, similar to magnesium, resulting in decreased release of ACh [13]. Dibekacin and sisomycin block the neuromuscular junction and are associated with the disappearance of action potentials and a decrease in the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials. These effects were augmented by the use of MgCl2. Factors known to enhance neuromuscular block in the presence of aminoglycosides include the curare-like drugs, magnesium and botulinum toxin. Patients who have received large doses of aminoglycoside administered into the peritoneal or pleural space, which can lead to high peak serum concentrations following absorption from these spaces, are also susceptible. The neuromuscular paralysis can be prevented or reversed by providing additional calcium intravenously [8]. Critically ill patients requiring prolonged ventilatory care and coincident treatment with aminoglycoside antibiotics and steroids are at particular risk. Pancuronium and vecuronium are reported to have caused a myopathy [14], although neither the mechanism nor the validity of the association with steroidal relaxants is known at present. Muscle dysfunction is a common feature of critical illness, and it is possible that neuromuscular blocking drugs may interfere with muscle repair and that these effects are compounded by aminoglycoside antibiotics and large doses of corticosteroids. Hasfurther and Bailey [15] reported failure of reversal after rocuronium in a patient who had received oral neomycin in anticipation of open bowel resection. It is well established that the administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics will cause a prolongation of the action of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, owing to both pre- and post-synaptic effects of the antibiotics at the neuromuscular junction. Calcium channel-blocking drugs Calcium channel-blocking drugs are widely used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, bronchospasm associated with exercise-induced asthma and the treatment of oesophageal spasms [16]. A patient known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy on long-term verapamil, 40 mg three times a day, was given pancuronium 2 mg and tubocurarine 5 mg for muscle relaxation for an elective cholecystectomy. Approximately 2.5 h after initial administration, there was a profound degree of muscle paralysis with no third twitch in the train-of-four. Antagonism of the block was attempted with neostigmine 2.5 mg and atropine 1.2 mg. After 6 min, there was no change in the degree of residual block with no return of the third or fourth twitch and no significant alteration of the height in the first or second twitch [17]. Similar reports of prolonged duration of action of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants have appeared in the literature [18,19]. The effects of four organic calcium channel antagonists (nicardipine, nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil) on the neuromuscular blocking activities of tubocurarine, suxamethonium, decamethonium and neomycin were studied in isolated mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations [20]. The effective concentration of suxamethonium for 50% inhibition of single indirect twitch responses was reduced threefold when the preparations were pretreated with calcium channel antagonists at 10 μmol. The neuromuscular blocking effect of decamethonium was also enhanced to a similar degree. In a similar study with nicardipine, verapamil and diltiazem, each of which caused a concentration-related depression in muscle response, nicardipine had the most and diltiazem the least effect [21]. It has been suggested that calcium channel antagonists are endowed with the unique capability to affect the post-synaptic nicotinic ACh receptor allosterically, thus promoting its desensitization [20]. This view supported the work of Adam and Henderson in 1986 [22] who found that certain calcium channel antagonists significantly potentiated the block of endplate currents produced by suxamethonium at concentrations at which the calcium channel antagonists themselves had no effect on end-plate currents. Rooke et al. in 1994 [23] found that patients receiving chronic calcium channel antagonist therapy are at no greater risk of hyperkalaemia after suxamethonium than those not taking such medication. Intravenous verapamil (0.2 mg kg−1) reduced by 25% and 30%, respectively, the dose of atracurium required to produce a 50% or 95% neuromuscular block. In contrast, diltiazem (1 mg kg−1) failed to produce significant changes [24]. Nicardipine decreased significantly the vecuronium requirement in a dose-dependent manner at doses of 1, 2 and 3 μmol kg−1 min−1. Nicardipine also reduced both the plasma concentration of vecuronium to maintain 90% depression and the total plasma clearance of vecuronium. The results of Kawabata et al.[25] indicate that vecuronium infusion dose requirements are reduced by as much as 53% after a clinical dose of nicardipine. However, Bell et al.[26] found that neither the time to onset of maximum block nor the duration of clinical relaxation differed significantly between patients receiving chronic nifedipine therapy when given atracurium and vecuronium. Neostigmine 10−6 mol L−1 did not produce any significant changes in the maximal recovery of twitch depression induced with calcium channel blockers and muscle relaxants in combination, and neostigmine also had no effect on maximal recovery time of twitch depression [27]. Although there have been contradictory reports, vigilance is advised regarding potential problems resulting from the interaction of both depolarizing and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with concurrent calcium channel blocker therapy. Lithium Lithium and sodium are in the same group of the Periodic Table and share similar physical properties. Lithium is transported into the cell with sodium during cellular depolarization. Lithium influx is about 70% of that of sodium, and extrusion from the cell occurs at only 10% of the rate of sodium. Intracellular accumulation of lithium may reduce resting membrane potential (more positive), which could in turn reduce the height of the action potentials and reduce the effectiveness of the Na+:K+ pump. At concentrations above 2 mmol L−1, lithium produces somnolence, lethargy, muscle weakness, stupor and coma. When animals were chronically pretreated with lithium, there was a slight reduction in the dosage requirement for tubocurarine. At concentrations well above therapeutic serum levels, indirect and direct twitch responses were depressed [28]. In a study on the isolated rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation, lithium led to significant enhancement of the myoneural blocking effects of suxamethonium, pancuronium and vecuronium [29]. Prolonged treatment of rats with lithium inhibited the increase in the number of extra junctional ACh receptors that occurred in denervated skeletal muscle. In normal muscle, lithium reduces the number of ACh receptors at the neuromuscular junction. These changes appear to be relatively specific for lithium [30]. In the 1970s, two case reports described prolonged neuromuscular block; in patients receiving lithium therapy, one after suxamethonium and the other after pancuronium [31,32]. There had been a previous report of abnormal recovery following an anaesthetic with methohexitone and suxamethonium (30 mg) in a patient with a serum lithium concentration of 3.4 mmol L−1[33]. It was suggested that lithium should be discontinued for at least 24 h before anaesthesia. The effects of lithium on transmitter release are not clear. The primary mechanism of block by lithium may result from decreased transmitter release and reduced excitability of the presynaptic terminals [34]. However, there have been reports showing that lithium stimulated the secretion of ACh [35,36]. Even though the presynaptic effects of lithium, particularly on ACh release, are not clearly defined, it seems very likely, from the available evidence, that the effects of muscle relaxants are likely to be enhanced during chronic lithium therapy. At therapeutic levels, there appears to be only a minimal interaction with competitive neuromuscular blocking agents. The reduction in post-synaptic nicotinic receptor turnover and density during chronic lithium therapy, along with the reduction in the efficacy of the Na+:K+ pump, are important factors in increasing the sensitivity to muscle relaxants. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic range, and high plasma levels cause muscle weakness. Patients on lithium therapy are required to maintain adequate sodium and fluid intake. Alterations in lithium levels may occur during disease, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract. The British National Formulary suggests that lithium should be stopped for 2 days before major surgery, but the normal dose can be continued for minor surgery [37]. It is recommended that there is close monitoring of fluids and electrolytes and that lithium levels be measured before the administration of muscle relaxants to patients on lithium. Magnesium Magnesium is a physiological calcium antagonist, and there is a correlation between the depression of neuromuscular transmission and serum magnesium concentration. The depression of neuromuscular transmission actually has a better correlation with the serum Mg2+:Ca2+ ratio than with the serum magnesium concentration itself. Magnesium sulphate is used increasingly in the treatment of pre-eclampsia, endocrine crises (e.g. phaeochromocytoma) and in cardiac surgery. This has significant implications for anaesthesia because of its interaction with neuromuscular blockers [38,39]. Magnesium sulphate causes a dose-related depression of ACh release by competition with Ca2+ at the presynaptic membrane and in the sarcoplasm of the muscle. There is a significant correlation between the Ca2+:Mg2+ ratio and the effect produced at the neuromuscular junction [40,41]. There is a reduction in twitch response that will potentiate the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Unlike non-depolarizing blocking drugs, however, magnesium decreases twitch response without tetanic or TOF fade. The effect of magnesium sulphate is only partially reversed by Ca2+, suggesting that alternative mechanisms of action may exist. In the presence of suxamethonium, magnesium hastens the development of phase 2 block [42]. After treatment with magnesium sulphate, an increase in the degree of block and a prolonged duration of action of vecuronium has been noted. Kwan et al. in 1996 [43] reported a case in which 1 mg of vecuronium lasted 4 h in a patient treated with magnesium sulphate for severe pre-eclampsia, whose serum Mg2+ level was in the therapeutic range. Magnesium sulphate in 60 mg kg−1 doses administered at recovery from vecuronium block, at a train-of-four ratio of 0.7, caused rapid and profound recurarization [44]. In a pregnant patient with an open eye injury, who was receiving i.v. magnesium 2 g hourly during preterm labour, rocuronium produced a fourfold increase in the duration of neuromuscular block [45]. Where suxamethonium is concerned, the situation is less clear. There was no significant increase in serum K+ concentration after pretreatment with magnesium sulphate before suxamethonium administration [46]. In one study, in the cat, antagonism between suxamethonium and Mg2+ was demonstrated [47]. A bolus of magnesium sulphate may reduce the hypertensive response to laryngoscopy and intubation [48]. Patients receiving magnesium therapy are likely to have a prolonged response to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants; the increase in duration of paralysis may be as much as fourfold. Anticonvulsants Patients chronically receiving anticonvulsants are resistant to competitive neuromuscular blockers [49]. Acutely administered phenytoin enhances a pre-existing non-depolarizing block [50]. In this group, phenytoin was administered intravenously in a dose of 10 mg kg−1 to a group of patients in whom steady-state neuromuscular block had been established with an infusion of vecuronium. There was an increase in block at 30 and 45 min after the start of the phenytoin infusion. This observation agrees with previous animal work, which had shown a direct neuromuscular blocking action of phenytoin [51]. In a study with patients chronically receiving anticonvulsants, those receiving phenytoin recovered more quickly from a vecuronium-induced block. The recovery index in the phenytoin group was 7.9±2.2 min compared with 17.8±5.1 min in the control group. The total duration of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block was significantly shorter in the phenytoin group (31.9±6 min compared with 69.7 ± 12.9 min in the control group). However, the time to maximum block and recovery from atracurium was unaffected by phenytoin therapy. The mechanism of action of phenytoin on the neuromuscular junction appears to be complex. There have been reports showing a post-junctional effect, a pre-junctional effect and a reduction in synthesis of ACh [52]. Phenytoin also has a stabilizing effect on neuronal membranes related to its action on the transcellular flux of sodium, potassium and calcium ions [53]. Decreased sensitivity to metocurine during long-term phenytoin therapy may also be attributable to altered protein binding and ACh receptor changes [54]. Gray et al.[50] suggested that, as vecuronium is 90% protein bound and phenytoin is 80% protein bound, an increased concentration of free active drug after displacement of vecuronium from protein binding sites may be a factor in the increased neuromuscular block after acute phenytoin therapy. The explanation for the resistance to neuromuscular block observed after chronic phenytoin therapy is not clear. Norris et al.[51] reported muscle weakness, which improved after chronic phenytoin therapy was stopped. In 1997, Hans et al.[55] showed that anticonvulsant therapy increased plasma alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels independent of the plasma anticonvulsant level. However, duration and recovery of vecuronium-induced block did not correlate with plasma AAG levels, and it was concluded that elevated AAG did not contribute to the resistance to vecuronium-induced block by anticonvulsants. There have been reports of prolonged onset time and accelerated recovery from pipecuronium in patients treated with chronic anticonvulsant therapy [56,57]. Chronic treatment with anticonvulsants also resulted in more rapid recovery from a neuromuscular block produced by doxacurium and metocurine [58]. Even though there is resistance to pancuronium in patients receiving carbamazepine [59], prior chronic carbamazepine therapy did not influence mivacurium-induced neuromuscular block [60]. However, resistance to rocuronium in an epileptic patient on long-term carbamazepine therapy has been reported [61]. In patients receiving long-term treatment with phenytoin or carbamazepine, three possible mechanisms for resistance to non-depolarizers are reported: (1) increased hepatic metabolism and clearance by enzyme induction; (2) an increase in protein binding resulting in a decreased free fraction of the drug; and (3) decreased ACh receptor sensitivity with subsequent upregulation of the ACh receptor [62-64]. A decreased duration of action of rocuronium in a patient with renal failure on chronic phenytoin therapy has also been reported [65]. Loan and colleagues [66] found a reduction in the duration of action of rocuronium in patients receiving carbamazepine alone or in combination with other anticonvulsants. The actions of atracurium and mivacurium are not affected by co-medication with phenytoin or carbamazepine [67]. In a study of the in vitro neuromuscular effects of valproic acid on the rat neuromuscular junction [68], significant block did not occur. The partial block that was produced was caused predominantly by a direct inhibitory effect of valproic acid on the muscle itself. However, it has been suggested that valproic acid may cause upregulation of the ACh receptor, as acute administration in animals causes partial neuromuscular block and potentiates the effects of neuromuscular blocking drugs [63]. Driessen et al.[69] reported accelerated recovery from rocuronium in an end-stage renal failure patient on chronic anticonvulsant therapy with sodium valproate and primidone. After suxamethonium, there have been observations of prolonged duration of action (14.3±2.3 min in anticonvulsant-treated patients compared with 10.0±1.6 min in a control group), which was attributed to anticonvulsant-induced upregulation of post-synaptic ACh receptors [70]. It has also been shown that phenytoin reduces suxamethonium-induced myalgia [71]. Resistance or decreased sensitivity to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants in patients receiving chronic phenytoin therapy is reasonably well established. A similar response may occur in patients on chronic carbamazepine therapy. In contrast, acute administration of phenytoin is likely to enhance a non-depolarizing block. The effect of valproic acid is uncertain, but it is known to have a direct inhibitory effect on muscle. Effect on ACh release Botulinum toxin Botulinum toxin is known to block ACh release at the neuromuscular junction [72]. Botulinum neurotoxin type A, a di-chain protein produced by Clostridium botulinum, blocks ACh release from peripheral nerves by binding to the terminals, undergoing internalization and proteolysing a protein essential for exocytosis [73]. Perie et al.[74] concluded that the intracellular target of botulinum neurotoxin A is a protein of the ACh vesicle membrane. The toxin has been used for periocular injections in patients with blepharospasm [75]. When used for focal dystonias, botulinum toxin may cause a transient impairment of neuromuscular transmission in muscles distant from those injected. Fiacchino et al.[76] described a patient who underwent general anaesthesia twice during treatment with botulinum toxin. The patient's sensitivity to vecuronium was low 90 days after the seventh treatment with toxin and normal 8 days after the ninth treatment. It is possible that repeated treatments with the toxin may cause continuous remodelling of neuromuscular junctions and may cause the patient to develop some tolerance to the action of neuromuscular blockers. Chloroquine Chloroquine has a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking action and can have an additive effect on non-depolarizing muscle relaxants used during anaesthesia. Chloroquine has been shown to generate ACh receptor antibodies [77]. Chloroquine also has a local anaesthetic-like effect on the membranes of axons and muscle fibres, which results in a reduction in transmitter output and a decrease in the amplitude of the action potentials of the muscle fibres [78]. Chloroquine induced myasthenic syndrome [79], in a patient taking the drug for presumed reticular erythematous mucinosis, was probably caused by a direct effect of chloroquine on the neuromuscular junction. The generalized myasthenic syndrome was responsive to i.v. edrophonium. The syndrome was rapidly reversible, as clinical and electrophysiological recovery was documented 4 days after discontinuation of chloroquine therapy, and recovery was complete in 11 days. From the available evidence, it is likely that chronic chloroquine therapy will prolong the effect of non-depolarizing block. Quinidine and procainamide Quinidine, a potent antiarrhythmic drug, is used to treat both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Quinidine potentiates both depolarizing and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. Kambam et al.[80] observed desensitization block and prolongation of a suxamethonium block in a patient receiving quinidine preoperatively. It was concluded that the principal mechanism for this was depression of plasma cholinesterase activity. Miller et al.[81] studied the interaction between quinidine and neuromuscular blockers in the cat anterior tibialis and the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. The neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine, suxamethonium and gallamine was doubled in intensity and duration after quinidine. Edrophonium was not completely effective in antagonizing a block produced by quinidine. Posttetanic facilitation with non-depolarizing blockers is decreased after quinidine. Procainamide and quinidine also possess local anaesthetic properties. These anti-arrhythmics may potentiate neuromuscular block by interfering with the release of ACh [82] and by impairing transmission at nerve terminals. Local anaesthetics are also known to displace muscle relaxants, which are bound to plasma proteins, thus providing increased concentrations of the muscle relaxant at the myoneural junction. Harrah et al.[83] reported that procainamide, lignocaine and propranolol increased the intensity and duration of a tubocurarine block. It has been suggested that procainamide and quinidine cause clinically significant potentiation of non-depolarizing drugs because of their AChR channel-blocking activity [84]. Effect in the synaptic cleft Bambuterol Bambuterol is an inactive prodrug that is slowly converted in the body to its active form terbutaline. The carbonate groups that are split off can selectively inhibit plasma cholinesterase. Oral administration of bambuterol has been reported to augment a suxamethonium block [85,86]. A mivacurium block may be similarly augmented, especially in patients with a heterozygous abnormality of plasma cholinesterase [87]. Clonidine Administration of the alpha 2 agonist clonidine has the ability to reduce the anaesthetic requirements of traditional agents by as much as 50% [88]. Conflicting reports have appeared regarding the effects of clonidine on a vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block [89,90]. The clinical duration of a bolus of vecuronium 0.1 mg kg−1 was measured in a group of patients who received clonidine, 4.0-5.5 mm kg−1 orally 90 min before arriving in the operating room and compared with a control group receiving no premedication. The time to recovery to 25% of the control (first twitch in the train-of-four sequence) after vecuronium was significantly longer in the clonidine group (51.2±7.5 min compared with 40.5±5.1 min in the control group) and was probably caused by a pharmacokinetic interaction [89]. Substance B, a chemical isolated from brain, reverses presynaptically modulated inhibition of evoked ACh release. Inhibitory modulating agents whose activity is reversed by substance B included clonidine [91]. No difference between clonidine-treated and control patients in onset time, duration or recovery index of neuromuscular block from vecuronium has been reported [90]. Although clonidine interferes with ACh release, its effect at the neuromuscular junction has not been quantified, and its effect on the action of muscle relaxants remains uncertain. Cyclophosphamide In 1995, Vigouroux and Voltaire [92] reported a case of prolonged neuromuscular block after mivacurium for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a 45-year-old patient treated with cyclophosphamide for Wegener's granulomatosis. The duration of action of an intubating dose of 0.2 mg kg−1 of mivacurium was 75 min. Additional bolus doses of 1 mg (25% of the maintenance dose) every 10-15 min were sufficient for maintaining relaxation. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity was reduced by 50%. Cholinesterase inhibition from cyclophosphamide could be a significant factor. Ecothiopate Ecothiopate is a potent long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of glaucoma. In addition to its local effect in the eye, systemic absorption is sufficient to produce a decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity. The fall in activity of plasma cholinesterase is rapid in the first 2 weeks, and levels of less than 5% of normal have been reported in patients receiving ecothiopate eye drops for a prolonged period of time. After the cessation of therapy, it takes 4 weeks for the plasma cholinesterase levels to return to normal. Pantuck [93] reported an extended response to suxamethonium in a patient receiving ecothiopate eye drops. Prolonged apnoea after suxamethonium was reported by Gesztes [94]. Muscle relaxation can be achieved safely with suxamethonium in patients with decreased plasma cholinesterase activity if neuromuscular function is monitored closely [95]. In a study performed by Kraunak et al.[96], ecothiopate had no significant effect on the potentiation of suxamethonium caused by anaesthetic drugs. The manufacturers of mivacurium advise that this drug should not be used in the presence of ecothiopate because of the unpredictable duration of action after the suppression of plasma cholinesterase activity. H2 receptor antagonists H2 receptor antagonists are used extensively for the treatment and prevention of oesophageal and gastroduodenal ulcer disease. An extensive range of proprietary medicines are available over the counter. Both cimetidine (5 mmol L−1) and ranitidine (1 mmol L−1) have been shown to potentiate the effect of ACh on the toad rectus abdominis muscle 4 and 2.6 times, respectively, when compared with saline [97]. Increasing doses of the drugs did not produce muscle contracture as did suxamethonium, but there was a concentration-dependent and non-parallel shift of the ACh response curve together with a reduction in maximal response, suggesting a non-depolarizing mechanism of action, possibly resulting from ion channel block. Cimetidine and ranitidine both produce an immediate and prolonged effect on the neuromuscular block in rats receiving suxamethonium infusions [98]. The degree of non-competitive block produced by H2 receptor antagonists has been the subject of several studies [99,100]. Anticholinesterase activity has been attributed to cimetidine and ranitidine, although there is no clinical relevance in the parturient [101] or in patients presenting for elective surgery [102]. Ulsamer [103] found that the time from injection of vecuronium to neuromuscular recovery was significantly prolonged after 5 mg kg−1 cimetidine. It has also been suggested that interaction between cimetidine and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants occurs at the presynaptic level, because experimental investigation has shown calcium to reverse the effects of cimetidine [104]. The neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine was potentiated at high concentrations of nizatidine and ranitidine, while it was antagonized at lower doses [105]. However, McCarthy et al.[106] found no differences in non-depolarizing block after pretreatment with ranitidine or cimetidine. Chronic exposure to cimetidine or ranitidine at human therapeutic concentrations in rats does not affect the neuromuscular pharmacodynamics of suxamethonium or atracurium [107]. Intravenous famotidine at human therapeutic doses fails to alter neuromuscular function in vivo[108]. Exposure to cimetidine has no effect on neuromuscular block from rocuronium [109]. These conflicting reports do not permit a clear conclusion on the effect of H2 receptor antagonists on the neuromuscular junction. The anticholinesterase effect of H2 antagonists in the doses used in clinical practice is unlikely to have an effect on muscle relaxants. With non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, potentiation occurs only at very high concentrations, much above therapeutic levels. However, individual variations may occur during the use of muscle relaxants in patients on long-term treatment with H2 receptor antagonists. Pyridostigmine Anticholinesterase therapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients suffering from myasthenia gravis. The use of suxamethonium in these patients may have variable effects [110]. There is a documented resistance to onset of depolarizing block in patients who are maintained on their anticholinesterase therapy preoperatively [111]. Reduced metabolism of the depolarizing drugs results in a propensity for prolonged recovery and the development of phase 2 block [112]. There does, however, seem to be little correlation between plasma cholinesterase activity and the duration of block [113]. Mivacurium has been used successfully in myasthenic patients in a dose that was half the recommended ED95. This resulted in a 93% block of T1 with a prolonged recovery index (25-75% T1) of 20.5 min, and subsequent antagonism with neostigmine was uncomplicated [114]. However, Fleming and Lewis [115] showed no increase in duration of action with mivacurium when used in rats treated with pyridostigmine and suggested that increased competition at the neuromuscular junction, following pretreatment with anticholinesterase agents, has a more marked effect on duration of action than inhibition of plasma cholinesterase. Preoperative use of pyridostigmine has also been shown to reduce the neuromuscular block produced by vecuronium [116]. Tacrine Tacrine is a powerful anticholinesterase inhibitor that prolongs the duration of action of suxamethonium-induced neuromuscular block and may lead to phase 2 block [117,118]. This interaction was used clinically before the introduction of short-acting non-depolarizing agents [119]. Tacrine is currently being investigated for use in patients with Alzheimer's disease [120], and this important interaction may be encountered more frequently. Post-synaptic effect β-Receptor blocking drugs There have been reports of prolonged response to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs in patients receiving atenolol or propranolol [83,121,122]. It is difficult to explain this interaction in terms of neuromuscular conduction and block, although it is known that propranolol possesses local anaesthetic properties and may interfere with the propagation of the nerve action potential. It is also possible that a pharmokinetic effect is involved. Benzodiazepines There have been conflicting reports on the interactions of benzodiazepines with muscle relaxants. In 1970, Feldman and Crawley [123] suggested that diazepam interacted with muscle relaxant drugs. Diazepam alone has no effect on the response of the tibialis anterior muscle to indirect stimulation in dogs and, in a bolus dose of 5 mg, does not influence a pre-existing partial block by tubocurarine, gallamine or pancuronium [124]. The degree and duration of block by tubocurarine was not affected significantly by simultaneous administration of diazepam in man. In a review of the literature by Martins [125] in 1975, it was concluded that diazepam exerts a possible sparing effect on the dose of muscle relaxants of between 8% and 30%. It was concluded that diazepam in therapeutic doses did not affect neuromuscular transmission and that this sparing effect did not result from a direct pharmacological interaction nor an effect on skeletal muscle fibres. This sparing effect of diazepam was thought most probably to be caused by a summation of muscle relaxant actions exerted at different levels of the nervous system (spinal and brainstem levels), resulting in inhibition of polysynaptic reflex activity, enhancement of presynaptic inhibition and depression of gamma motor neurone activity. Experimental work has shown that, at low concentrations (1-100 μg mL−1), diazepam increased the twitch contractions in response to motor nerve stimulation in the chick and rat in a dose-dependent manner [126]. Higher concentrations decreased twitch tension and greatly reduced the contractions produced by ACh and tetraethylammonium in chick skeletal muscle. However, in a dose of 0.15 mg kg−1, diazepam had no significant effect on the neuromuscular block produced by either tubocurarine or suxamethonium. It was concluded that diazepam may either increase or decrease the twitch tension in rat and chick skeletal muscle, the effect being dependent on the concentrations used. Similar results were obtained by Driessen et al.[127]. At present, the consensus is that benzodiazepines, in concentrations achieved during normal therapy, do not influence a neuromuscular block. Lincosamides The pre- and post-junctional effects of the lincosamide antibiotics clindamycin and lincomycin have been studied in animals [128]. Lincomycin and clindamycin appeared to produce muscle paralysis by different mechanisms. Clindamycin exerts a direct depressant action on muscle contractility, whereas lincomycin primarily depresses neuromuscular transmission [129]. Wright and Collier [130] demonstrated that the direct depressant action on muscle contractility by clindamycin was fivefold more potent than that of lincomycin. Rubbo and colleagues [131] observed that lincomycin decreased ACh release, while clindamycin increased it. The antagonism by neostigmine and calcium of a clindamycin-augmented non-depolarizing blockade in man may be incomplete [132]. The latter results suggested that the neuromuscular blocking effects of clindamycin involve primarily a post-junctional mechanism, whereas the effects of lincomycin are both pre- and post-junctional. In 1993, de Gouw et al.[133] concluded that the administration of colistin and clindamycin may cause a significant prolongation of an already long-acting neuromuscular block. Unknown site of action Penicillin The neuroexcitatory and depressant effects of penicillin at the animal soleus neuromuscular junction was studied by Raines and Dretchen [134]. Post-tetanic potentiation in this system, which is mediated by repetitive discharges originating in nerve terminals after high-frequency stimulation, is augmented by penicillin. Larger doses depressed post-tetanic stimulation, and still larger doses produced varying degrees of neuromuscular block. Only extremely large doses of penicillin will produce any effect on neuromuscular block, and this is unlikely to be encountered in clinical practice. Metronidazole Metronidazole has been reported to facilitate neuromuscular transmission and to antagonize tubocurarine-induced neuromuscular block partially in isolated rat diaphragm [135]. However, in cats, metronidazole was observed to potentiate the effects of vecuronium after 1 h of administration. The potentiating action of metronidazole seen with vecuronium was not reproducible when pancuronium was used, suggesting that it was not an effect of metronidazole on neuromuscular transmission. It may be secondary to an effect of metronidazole on the distribution or metabolism of vecuronium. The slow onset of the effect of metronidazole on the neuromuscular junction suggests that the effect may be brought about by a metabolite rather than by metronidazole itself. Caution may be necessary when vecuronium is administered to patients treated with metronidazole [136]. Corticosteroids The effect of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, methyl prednisolone) on the recovery time from vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block was studied using evoked potential measurements following stimulation of the ulnar nerve [137]. Recovery time was prolonged by corticosteroids and, in the case of hydrocortisone, this effect was significant. It was speculated that corticosteroids reduced the clearance of vecuronium. Prolongation of recovery time from vecuronium-induced block after the administration of corticosteroids may be explained not only by the direct effects of hydrocortisone on the neuromuscular junction but also by the effect of hydrocortisone on the elimination of vecuronium from plasma. In the cat, hydrocortisone in 7-15 mg kg−1 doses significantly enhanced the 50% depression of the indirectly elicited twitch tension of the tibialis anterior muscle produced by an i.v. infusion of pancuronium [138]. It is uncertain as to the doses of corticosteroids that may affect neuromuscular function. It is likely that chronic high-dose corticosteroid therapy may prolong the duration of action of vecuronium and pancuronium. Tamoxifen Tamoxifen has been reported to prolong block after the administration of atracurium, but the mechanism is not known [139]. Conclusion Medications in use for disease states commonly encountered in any population group may have the potential to alter function at the neuromuscular junction. We have reviewed the possible effects of drugs that are in common usage, often chronically, on neuromuscular junctional activity. Much of the evidence for the effects of drugs on the neuromuscular junction comes from animal experiments, often with doses not used in clinical practice. It is noteworthy that, despite the extremely wide use of these drugs, the incidence in the literature of prolonged or adverse interactions with neuromuscular blocking agents is sparse. This could result from either difficulty in establishing the diagnosis or the rarity of clinically important events. The determination of the role of concurrent medication in producing an unpredicted neuromuscular block usually follows a process of elimination, often after the problem has resolved. Thus, knowledge of the possibilities provides awareness of potential problems during clinical practice.",

      "title": "Olanzapine-induced akathisia treated with clozapine",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Akathisia is probably the most troublesome side effect of antipsychotic medications. The onset of akathisia may be acute, chronic, tardive, or delayed, or may occur when switching or stopping antipsychotics. While its mechanism is poorly understood, the current hypothesis is low dopaminergic tone, with studies showing interactions in mesolimbic, mesocortical, and spinal dopamine/norepinephrine pathways and the involvement of multiple other neurotransmitter systems.[1] Second-generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine have a very low propensity to cause akathisia but are not entirely free of such side effects.[2] A 32-year-old woman presented with an 11-year history suggestive of prominent delusion of infidelity, hallucinatory behavior, aggression toward her husband, forgetfulness, and poor personal hygiene. She was diagnosed with psychosis not otherwise specified with a differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, with no history of prior psychiatric treatment. The patient was started on increasing doses of Tab. Risperidone up to 6 mg/day. She developed extrapyramidal side effects, which were treated with Tab. Trihexyphenidyl up to 4 mg/day, which she was not able to tolerate due to its side effects of excessive dryness of mouth and constipation. Risperidone was cross-tapered with olanzapine, which was gradually increased to 10 mg/day. Although with 10 mg olanzapine, her symptoms improved, the patient reported subjective restlessness, with the patient complaining of the urge to move around. She was observed to be fidgety, tapping her feet, and difficulty sitting still. This warranted a diagnosis of olanzapine-induced akathisia. The patient was prescribed Tab. Propranolol 20 mg with only minimal improvement in symptoms of akathisia. Olanzapine was cross-tapered with increasing doses of clozapine with which akathisia completely resolved and psychotic symptoms also improved considerably. The patient on the last follow-up was in full remission on clozapine 200 mg/day. Drugs such as clozapine and quetiapine, which have a weak dopaminergic action and a more potent serotonergic effect, may rarely cause akathisia in the absence of another antipsychotic.[1] Treatment of akathisia must ideally start with prevention, psychosocial methods, and modifications in the treatment such as careful cross-tapering of potent with less potent antipsychotics with close monitoring of psychotic symptoms.[1] In our patient, the change in medication from Olanzapine to Clozapine showed significant improvement in her psychotic symptoms as well as ameliorated the akathisia. Other pharmacological interventions include beta-blockers such as propranolol, which was the first-line treatment for akathisia. Anticholinergics and benzodiazepines have some therapeutic value as well but their effects may not be sufficient to reduce akathisia. Newer treatments include Mianserine and Cyproheptadine, which have the potential to counteract psychotropic-induced D2 receptor blockade. Another new intervention is the use of low-dose Mirtazapine.[3] Akathisia may also develop due to drug-drug interactions between psychotropic medications and other drugs such as antimicrobials. Therefore, it is important to take a detailed medical history in order to identify and/or prevent side effects that may be caused by such drug interactions.[4] Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "abstract": "Hydrocodone is an opioid derived from codeine, which has been used for many years as a short-acting analgesic combined with acetaminophen (or less commonly ibuprofen).Common and severe psychiatric side effects included include mental depression, mood changes, hallucination, delirium, somnolence, agitation, and dysphoria.This is a report of a particular case that resulted in acute psychosis after immediately starting on Hydrocodone because of back pain in a 35 year old male, with no past psychiatrist history.The patient returned to his baseline mental status after the hydrocodone was discontinued.Earlier research was published about these symptoms are the ones where hydrocodone was used in combination with other drugs, but in this unique case the patient was not any other medication except the hydrocodone.This unique case showed an association between the short term use of hydrocodone and development of psychiatric symptoms.Recognition of these uncommon psychiatric side effects of hydrocodone usage will allow for early recognition of their etiology, symptoms and treatment.Psychotic symptoms induce by analgesics are not a common condition but they still remain under diagnosed and untreated.",

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

Factors contributing to the increasing popularity include the user's ability to control the dosage, an understanding of the immediate effects, and its availability. Those most at risk appear to be young Caucasian males. Phencyclidine-related problems are often like tips of icebergs, the underlying causes of which are hidden from public view. The problems often surface in the form of speech difficulties, memory loss, thinking disorders, personality changes, paranoia, severe depression, violence, accidents, suicides and homicides. Of particular concern to law enforcement personnel is the upsurge in phencyclidine-related violent crimes and carrying of weapons by users to protect themselves from their imagined persecutors. The evidence currently available supports the assumption that if there is a solution to the problem of phencyclidine abuse, that solution is prevention. Therefore, medical personnel and others within the helping professions must be alerted to the fact that phencyclidine is not just another drug problem. The findings from users we have already studied strongly suggest that phencyclidine is not an \"upper\" or a \"downer,\" but perhaps an \"insideouter\", with longer term implications.",

The most important toxic effect of the a-adrenergic agonist phenylpropanolamine is hypertension, which may result in hypertensive encephalopathy or intracerebral hemorrhage. The therapeutic index of phenylpropanolamine is low, and severe hypertension may occur after ingestion of less than three times the therapeutic dose. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine may also cause hypertension, as well as tachyarrhythmias due to β-adrenergic stimulation. Toxic reactions from caffeine are characterized by agitation, seizures, tachyarrhythmias, and hypotension. Management of toxic reactions to over-the-counter stimulants includes control of hypertension with a rapidly acting vasodilator, β-blockers for tachyarrhythmias, and control of seizures.

      "abstract": "The medication guidelines for fibromyalgia (FM) and neuropathic pain (NP) were mainly based on scientific evidence of analgesic efficacy in the literature. From a scientific viewpoint, it is justified, however, it does not necessarily agree with clinical priority. Adverse effects slightly affect these guidelines. Most adverse effects that were considered in the development of guidelines for NP including FM were short-term adverse effects such as drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, and dry mouth. However, the long-term adverse effects such as cognitive dysfunction, dependence or abuse, sexual dysfunction, fracture, and osteoporosis also should be considered in medication. The adverse effects of pregabalin are cognitive dysfunction, dependence or abuse, obesity, marked drowsiness (sometimes loss of consciousness), and an expensive drug price. The adverse effects of duloxetine are cognitive dysfunction, dementia, sexual dysfunction, and bleeding and the drug price is expensive. Tricyclic antidepressants are safer than serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors in terms of dementia or cognitive dysfunction. The price of amitriptyline is inexpensive and most adverse effects except obesity disappear as soon as it is discontinued. Many studies have shown the analgesic effect of amitriptyline in FM and NP. However, scientific evidence of efficacy is low, because they are old studies. In clinical practice, efficacy based on personal experience, adverse effects based on personal experience and scientific evidence, drug price, and degree of offlabel use in addition to scientific evidence of efficacy should be reflected in the order of priority. Pregabalin and duloxetine should be administered after amitriptyline in medication treatment for NP including FM.",

      "abstract": "Objetivos Determinar si la reacción catatónica aguda que tuvo la paciente se debió al inicio de tratamiento con Pimavanserina por su demencia (alteraciones de la conducta, alteraciones cognitivas, alucinaciones, etc), a la bajada de la dosis de Clonazepam (BDZ) con la que venia medicada o al progreso de la patologia neurodegenerativa. Material y métodos Se trata de la presentacion de un caso clinico. Donde la paciente de 65 años hace una reaccion catatonica aguda en el contexto de la bajada de medicacion (BDZ) donde por sus alucinaciones se le indica Pimavanserina. Se realiza una busqueda bibliografica en Pubmed tratando de recabar informacion al respecto de otros casos similares. A la paciente se le suspende la Pimavanserina y en 48 hs revierte el cuadro completamente de rigidez catatonica, incontinencia de esfinteres y demas signos y sintomas clinicos. Se realizo una TAC de Craneo que arrojo microinfartos no agudos. Sin otras alteraciones de gerarquia. Resultados y conclusiones No hay datos concluyentes, pero la reversibilidad del cuadro al retirar la medicacion antipsicotica nos sugiere que la paciente tuvo una reaccion cerebral al medicamento. Pareciera que la bajada de medicacion (BDZ) o la progresion de la demencia no influyeron directamente en el cuadro.",

      "title": "3,4-metilenodioximetanfetamina (‘éxtasis’): efectos emocionales y cognitivos a largo plazo y depleción serotoninérgica",
      "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to describe the different neuropsychological deficits associated to the consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'), as well as the growing evidence that attributes these deficits to the selective axonal damage to serotoninergic cells brought about by this substance.MDMA is an amphetamine derivative that, like its precursor, has properties as a stimulant. Part of its chemical structure is similar to that of the hallucinogen mescaline with which it shares the capacity to alter perception. Nevertheless, the primary pharmacological effect of this substance, which is what usually leads to its use and abuse, is chiefly linked to an intense positive emotional state. This effect on the individual's mood is also usually accompanied by numerous feelings of empathy, sociability and closeness, which turn this drug into a powerful entactogenic agent (a term used in psychotherapy to describe a state of wellbeing, closeness and emotional self-awareness produced by certain compounds). The antidepressant and entactogenic effects induced by an acute dose of MDMA can be accounted for by the notable increase in serotonin bioavailability triggered by the drug. Repeated consumption of MDMA, however, ends up affecting many functions that have been related to the serotoninergic systems, such as sleep, appetite, attention and memory, or one's emotional state.Most of the neuropsychological disorders found in individuals who take ecstasy on a regular basis can be explained by the selective neurodegeneration processes that the drug appears to produce in the serotonin terminals of the brain in the long run.",

      "abstract": "About 20% of adults experience excessive daytime sleepiness or severe fatigue. Causes include somatic conditions, psychiatric disorders, and medication or drug use. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If sleepiness persists despite optimal treatment of the underlying condition, exclusion of other causes, and behavioral interventions, wakefulness-promoting agents may be considered. However, no established pharmacological strategy exists for symptomatic treatment. Modafinil and stimulants like methylphenidate may offer some benefit based on experiences with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. Studies in specific patient groups (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, cancer-related fatigue) show variable results. The use of wakefulness-promoting agents is discouraged for addressing unexplained fatigue, as seen in the context of chronic fatigue syndrome.",

We intend to present in this study several oral adverse effects encountered during finasteride administration, represented by mild and moderate signs which generally responded to topical procedures without to require the stop of the drug administration. New studies on large samples will further document the existing relation between the described oral adverse effects and the implied pathophysiological mechanisms.

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

These may or may not be symptomatic, sustained or non-sustained and have variable ECG appearances: monomorphic or polymorphic, bidirectional, torsades de pointes. They risk degenerating into ventricular flutter of fibrillation and have been held responsible for the increased mortality observed unexpectedly in some long-term treatments. The drugs responsible are mainly those used in cardiology, probably due to predisposing circumstances (cardiomegaly, cardiac failure, previous severe ventricular arrhythmias, therapeutic associations, metabolic abnormalities). These include primarily the antiarrhythmic drugs (IA, IC, sotalol and bepridil), digitalis, sympathomimetics and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. These complications may be toxic or idiosyncratic, in patients with or without cardiac disease, and may also occur with other drugs: vasodilators and anti-anginal drugs (lidoflazine, vincamine, fenoxedil), psychotropic agents (phenothiazine and imipramine), antimitotics, antimalarials (chloroquine) or antibiotics (erythromycin, pentamidine). The prognosis is severe and the treatment is often difficult which makes prevention, helped by repeated surface ECG (or Holter monitoring), very important with careful assessment of patients at risk.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To discuss a case of synthethic marijuana use and subsequent withdrawal phenomenon that clinically resulted in PRES. Background: In the last decade synthetic marijuana has emerged as a new drug of abuse. Synthetic marijuana is colloquial known as “Spice,” which is typically composed of herbs, spices and other plant matter that are sprayed with at least one synthetic cannabinoid. They have diverse chemicals that are structurally distinct from THC. Given the heterogeneity of chemical composition, the intoxication effects are diverse. The presence of a withdrawal phenomenon following chronic use and clinical sequeale are not explored in the literature to date. Design/Methods: We discuss a case presentation of acute intoxication, withdrawal phenomenology and subsequent neurological complications of synthetic marijuana usage including PRES. Results: A 26yo man was found by police and paramedics to be confused and combative after he had smoked synthetic cannabinoids earlier in the evening. He was restrained by police and brought to the emergency department where he was noted to be febrile, combative and confused with normal heart rate and blood pressure. He had an unremarkable initial head computed tomography (CT) image. His labs were significant for hypernatremia, acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. His LP showed no xanthochromia or pleocytosis. On days 2–4 of the hospitalization he exhibited autonomic instability following withdrawal of his daily consumption of synthetic marijuana. A MRI was eventually obtained following 8 days in the hospital because of unresolved encephalopathy. It showed evidence of PRES, right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), small bilateral cortical and corpus collosum hemorrhages and superior cerebellar vermis subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The CT angiogram (CTA) showed no evidence of vasospasm or vasoconstriction or aneurysm. Conclusions: Our patient exhibited withdrawal phenomenon following 2 days cessation of daily synthetic marijuana. Clinically the patient exhibited autonomic instability and poor mentation resulting radiographically in PRES, ICH and SAH. Disclosure: Dr. Stack has nothing to disclose.",

Analgesics are classified as nonnarcotics (acetaminophen, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), narcotics (which include the morphine-like drugs), and analgesic adjuvants (a heterogeneous group of drugs, including antihistamines, phenothiazines, anticonvulsants, calcium channel blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants), which may have intrinsic analgesic efficacy for specific pain syndromes or may be used as co-analgesics in combination with the traditional nonnarcotic and narcotic agents. Although these agents can be used safely most of the time by patients with acute or chronic pain, all classes of analgesics may impair cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric functioning, which may influence job performance in specific instances.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

Also, to help a person grasp an internal or external threat, pain is regarded as an emotional sense and experience linked to tissue damage [1]. Several chemical mediators, including prostaglandin, histamine, and substance P, are released after tissue damage, causing pain to be transferred to the cerebral cortex via nerve fibers. The brain releases endorphins and alleviates or destroys the pain related to the stimulator [2]. Pain causes various complications such as hemodynamic changes, failure to seek treatment, fear, and anxiety in the patient [3, 4]. Various studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of different methods on pain management. These methods classify into pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management. Pharmacological pain management includes the use of EMLA cream, intradermal injection of lidocaine, and intravenous injection of fentanyl, ketamine, and propofol medications [5, 6].",

PKD is the most frequent among the paroxysmal dyskinesia syndromes, but it remains a rare disease, with prevalence estimated. PKD attacks are very brief, with many attacks per day. In PNKD, attacks are longer, less frequent, and precipitated not by sudden movements or physical exertion as in PKD, but rather by alcohol, caffeine, stress, excitement, or fatigue. PED is less common than PNKD and PKD. Anticonvulsants, such as clonazepam and carbamazepine, have been found to be of limited benefit. A number of other disorders that manifest with motor disturbance are important to be considered in the differential diagnosis.",

      "title": "Toxic peripheral neuropathy associated with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents.",
      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy ranks among the most common non-haematological adverse effects of a number of effective chemotherapeutic agents, including platinum compounds, taxanes and vinca alkaloids. Newer agents, such as bortezomib, thalidomide and lenalidomide, frequently exert similar neurotoxic effects on peripheral nerves. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) may result from a variety of mechanisms and may be related to causal factors, such as single dose per course, cumulative dose and risk factors including treatment schedule, prior or concomitant administration of other neurotoxic agents, age and pre-existing peripheral neuropathy of other causes. The symptoms usually begin during chemotherapy and they may even worsen after cessation of treatment. In most of the cases, patients experience positive (pain, paresthesias) or negative (numbness) sensory symptoms in distal extremities in a stocking-and-glove distribution with less prominent motor and autonomic involvement. To date, several neuroprotective agents including thiols, neurotrophic factors, anticonvulsants and antioxidants have been tested in preclinical models and clinical open label or randomized controlled trials for their ability to prevent or treat symptoms of CIPN. Although several of these agents hold promise as possible neuroprotective factors, clinical data are still controversial and none have as yet robustly been proven effective against CIPN. This review critically looks at the pathogenesis, incidence, risk factors, diagnosis, characteristics and management of peripheral neuropathy associated with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. We also highlight areas of future research to pursue.",

Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "title": "Human Pharmacology of MDMA",
      "abstract": "MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) is a widely misused psychostimulant drug abused among large segments of the young population. Pharmacologically it displays effects related to amphetamine-type drugs and a set of distinctive effects (closeness to others, facilitation to interpersonal relationship, and empathy) that have been named by some authors “entactogen” properties. MDMA is a potent releaser and/or reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). These actions result from the interaction of MDMA with the membrane transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and vesicular storage systems. The most frequent effects after MDMA/ecstasy administration are euphoria, well-being, happiness, stimulation, increased energy, extroversion, feeling close to others, increased empathy, increased sociability, enhanced mood, mild perceptual disturbances, changed perception of colors and sounds, somatic symptoms related to its cardiovascular and autonomic effects (blood pressure and heart rate increase, mydriasis), and moderate derealization but not hallucinations. Acute toxic effects are related to its pharmacologic actions. The serotonin syndrome (increased muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and hyperthermia), among others, is characteristic of acute toxicity episodes. MDMA metabolism is rather complex and includes 2 main metabolic pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The fact that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 partially regulates the O-demethylenation pathway prompted some expectations that subjects displaying the poor metabolizer phenotype may be at higher risk of acute toxicity episodes. In this metabolic pathway a mechanism-based inhibition of the enzyme operates because the formation of an enzyme–metabolite complex that renders all subjects, independently of genotype, phenotypically poor metabolizers after the administration of 2 consecutive doses. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics on acute toxicity is limited. One of the interesting features of MDMA metabolism is its potential involvement in the development of mid- to long-term neurotoxic effects as a result of progressive neurodegeneration of the serotonergic neurotransmission system.",

      "abstract": "Both neuropathic and nociplastic pain (non-nociceptive pain) are characterized by a similar pattern of clinical symptoms, including numbness, dysesthesia, tingling, and pricking. Whereas nociplastic pain results from altered nociception without indication of tissue damage or a somatosensory system lesion, neuropathic pain is caused by a disease or lesion affecting the somatosensory system. The available therapeutic options consist of antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants. Unfortunately, symptoms are often refractory, and increasing drug dosage may lead to adverse events. In this narrative review, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases from their inception up to 26 July 2025, using the key words “duloxetine,” “pregabalin,” and then ‘‘combination,’’ “nociplastic pain,” “neuropathic pain,” “efficacy,” “safety,” “pharmacology,” “pharmacokinetic,” and “pharmacodynamic.” We evaluated the role of combination therapy with duloxetine, a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and pregabalin, an antiseizure medication that acts on voltage-gated calcium channels α2δ subunit, in patients with neuropathic or nociplastic pain. The literature data indicate that combination therapy has synergistic effects, leading to fewer adverse events in specific categories of patients. Available evidence showed that combination therapy is generally not inferior to monotherapy, with slight differences in safety outcomes depending on supplementation, drug labels, and titration. These results indicate that even if not superior, combination therapy may be an alternative to monotherapy in selected patients: those who experience side effects from higher dosages of duloxetine or pregabalin and for whom symptom relief from dose reduction alone is not possible; those who use medications that interact with duloxetine; those who suffer from anxiety–depression, where pain is closely linked to mental symptoms; and those who have central neuropathic pain (often refractory).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Generalized motor seizures, usually tonic‐clonic, tonic‐vibratory, myoclonic or clonic, and stimulus‐sensitive/action myoclonus are typical features of progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs). Despite the introduction of many anticonvulsants, the treatment of these symptoms, particularly myoclonus, remains challenging, due to the incomplete and often transitory effects of most drugs. Moreover, treatment is only symptomatic, since therapy targeting the underlying aetiology for these genetic conditions is in its infancy. Traditional antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of PMEs are valproate, clonazepam, and phenobarbital (or primidone). These drugs may improve the overall performance of PME patients by decreasing their generalized seizures and, to a lesser extent, their myoclonic jerks. Newer drugs which have been shown to be effective include piracetam, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, and possibly perampanel for Lafora disease. The potential of other drugs (such as L‐triptophan and N‐acetylcysteine) and procedures (such as vagal and deep brain stimulation) has also been discussed. The available data on the efficacy of drugs are mainly based on small series or anecdotal reports. Two prospective, randomized, double blind studies investigating the novel SV2A ligand, brivaracetam, in genetically confirmed Unverricht‐Lundborg patients have been performed with disappointing results. When treating PMEs, particular care should be paid to avoid drugs known to aggravate myoclonus or myoclonic seizures, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, vigabatrin, tiagabine, gabapentin, and pregabalin. The emergency treatment of motor status, which often complicates the course of PMEs, consists of intravenous administration of benzodiazepines, valproate, or levetiracetam.",

While the symptom has been regarded as the symbolic representation of the event, its appearance and persistence have been variously attributed to the intensity of the trauma, the circumstances surrounding its occurrence, to the need for the symptoms to substitute for a repressed drive, wish, or fear and to the factor of secondary gain. Our interest in the subject of conversion hysteria originated during a study of the behavioral effects of acute brain injuries, when it was noted that subjects who developed hysterical anesthesias and paralyses recalled their accidents and described their injuries in language of violence. In contrast, patients without hysterical symptoms were either amnestic for or confabulatory about accident and injury, or used language which did not emphasize the physically traumatic aspects of the",

Many of the standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been reported to have antimyoclonic action in some types of myoclonus. L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (L-5HTP), in combination with carbidopa, is the most effective antimyoclonic drug in this class of pharmacologic agents. L-5HTP is an amino acid which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is decarboxylated in the brain to form the neurotransmitter serotonin. Numerous clinical trials of L-5HTP, in combination with carbidopa, have established its effectiveness in the treatment of postanoxic intention myoclonus. The most common adverse effects of L-5HTP/carbidopa are anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting, which usually decrease or disappear within several months after initiating therapy. Dyspnea with hyperventilation, hypotension, and sleepiness have been observed with doses of L-5HTP greater than 2000 mg/day. The only changes in routine laboratory tests have been a 20% decrease in plasma cholesterol level.",

      "abstract": "Pain may be attacked in the rheumatic diseases (1) centrally, with drugs ranging in efficiency from those which are potentially addictive and under the Dangerous Drugs Act (e.g., pethidine) and are therefore rarely used, down to simple analgesics such as paracetamol; (2) peripherally, by local action, whether it be by applications of heat or cold, by injections of local anaesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or by surgery; (3) peripherally, by anti-inflammatory non-analgesic agents taken systemically, such as the corticosteroids; and (4) peripherally, by anti-inflammatory-analgesic-antipyretic agents taken systemically, such as aspirin.The exact sites of action of the pyrazoles, indomethacin, the anthranilic compounds, and other anti-inflammatory-analgesic-antipyretic drugs are as yet uncertain, but along with these methods of attacking the pain-producing areas help must also be given to the distressed mind behind the joints. Faith in the future, cheerfulness, freedom from depression, and the development of a philosophy to deal with the uncertainties of the disease are essential. It has been said that you don't have to be a doctor to treat uncomplicated lobar pneumonia: anybody with a bottle of penicillin in his hands holds the cure. It is the incurable diseases that are really worth treating, and that make demands on the physician. To quote Tuker: \"My last word is this. Whoever has the care of a sorely stricken arthritic must encourage him to fulfil himself intellectually and spiritually, and to achieve-no matter what, but to achieve, so that he may nightly lay himself down on his bed of pain looking forward happily to the morrow's task, mind centred upon it, no matter what it is; sticking in stamps, research into anything you like, dabbling with pastel or water colours, writing chatty letters to friends. Anything at all, but let it be for him the most pressing thing of the day, and let him believe that you think it is. Help him and let him live, live fully.\"This is perhaps the best analgesic of all.",

Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

Some anti epileptic drugs may aggravate an epileptic syndrome. In 10-15% of patients with epilepsy, better control of seizures can be achieved with combination therapy. These patients are at greater risk of suffering clinically serious interactions. Drug interactions occur at the pharmacokinetic level and at the pharmacodynamic level, involving synergistic or antagonistic effects. Finally many drugs can interfere with the antiepileptic drug metabolism. The inverse effect is also frequent.

Manifestations of CIPN include numbness, tingling, neuropathic pain, cramping, and trouble handling small objects and walking. Recent research in the CIPN pathogenesis has revealed new strategies and pathways for developing novel therapies that can be scrutinized clinically to improve the management of this devastating toxicity. Unfortunately, no single agent is completely protective against this adverse effect, and because no single treatment option works for everyone, duloxetine is the only treatment option that can be recommended. After a thorough review, alternative therapeutic options such as antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic and topical gels containing baclofen and ketamine can be considered. In addition, Vitamins, Omega-3 fatty acids, Calcium, Magnesium, Cannabinoids, Melittin, and other natural products, as well as non-drug methods such as exercise, may be used to reduce the adverse effects of CIPN treatment medications. This review focuses on the new strategies for the prophylactic and therapeutic approaches of CIPN, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods.

      "title": "Anticonvulsants: aspects of their mechanisms of action",
      "abstract": "An ideal anticonvulsant drag would prevent or inhibit excessive pathological neuronal discharge without interfering with physiological neuronal activity and without producing untoward effects. Such an ideal compound is not yet available. However, during the last few years several new anticonvulsants have appeared (e.g. vigabatrine, gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, felbamate and oxcarbazepine) which may challenge the older, more established substances (i.e. phenytoin, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, valproate, carbamazepine and ethosuximide). Interestingly, several of the old and new anticonvulsants are beneficial in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions (most notably mood disorders) as well as neuropathic pain. The reason these various drags are effective in the treatment of such disparate clinical conditions is unknown. The answer may be that the neuronal dysfunctions underlying these conditions are similar in a mechanistic sense, but are manifested in different neurons/locations of the nervous system, or that the drags possess several mechanisms of action that contribute in different ways to the favourable effect depending on the condition studied. Even though all these drags inhibit excessive neuronal activity, this acute effect appears to be produced by several mechanisms, which fall into three major categories: (1) blockade of voltage‐gated sodium channels; (2) indirect or direct enhancement of inhibitory γ‐aminobutyric acid [GABAergic] neurotransmission; or (3) inhibition of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. Moreover, several of these drags fall into more than one category, and it is often unclear which category is responsible for a given effect of a drag. It is plausible that some of the beneficial effects observed in the clinic can be explained by the secondary neural depressant mechanisms of action of these substances, whereas other benefits may be due to long‐term neuro‐plastic effects, which may either be common or different across the various conditions treated. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain",

      "abstract": "It is well known that some drugs and neurodegenerative processes, such asParkinson’s disease, can cause extrapyramidal side effects (1). Extrapyramidal symptoms (ES) may be drug-induced and due affect tolerance and compliance (2). ES includes akathisia, parkinsonian symptoms (e.g. tremor, bradykinesia and muscle rigidity) and impaired involuntary movements (e.g. acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesia) (3). Especially, antipsychotic drugs therapy (4), antiemetics, and a variety of other drugs (5) can frequently cause severe occurrences and complications (4). Some drugs induced ES are thought to causean imbalance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the nigrostriatal pathway(1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine and doxepine, may have antidopaminergic effect(2). However, antidepressant drugs are not directly acting as dopamine antagonists(6), but some movement disorders symptoms are rarely described as a side effect of tricyclic antidepressants(2). Enuresis nocturna is a multidisciplinary problem worked on by such many physicians as pediatricians, urologists and child and adolescent psychiatrists (7) can cause a significant psychosocial problem for children and their parents (8), which is estimated at 3.8% to 25% (9). That is, there are over 50 million children with enuresis around the world (10). Theaetiology of this condition is not totally known. Medical therapies including imipramine, desmopressin and anticholinergics, behavioural therapy and enuretic alarm devices are proposed to manage this condition(8). TCAs drugs are widely used in the process of managing this condition (11), for instance, Imipramine can reduce wetting in some children and young people (12).Unsal et al. Here we report a case of imipramine induced acute dystonia in an enuretic child. 8- year-old boy with severe torticollis was assessed in our outpatient clinic and. Beforehand, he had been diagnosed as enuresis nocturna by a child psychiatrist and was given imipramine 10 mg/day for treatment. After three days initiating imipramine 10 mg/day, he had severe muscular spasm on his neck. He had no psychiatric and neurological history. Physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistries, blood counts were within normal limits. He wasonly taking imipramine, and no other medication had been used during this three days. He was diagnosed with imipramine induced dystonia and biperiden 5 mg was administered intramusculary. After 45 minutes, it was seen that torticollis was resolved and he was referred to child psychiatry for the treatment of enuresis nocturna.",

These substances are psychotropic drugs that belong to the hypnotic, neuroleptic, anxiolytic, antidepressant and antihistaminic family. In the clinical situation, sedation is an undesirable secondary effect after the utilization of these drugs. It is for this reason that sedative drugs are used in pre-anaesthesia or agitation, or even aggressive phenomena. The purpose of this article is therefore to highlight the different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs which can be used to induce sedation.",

      "abstract": "The author recently encountered a patient with hiccups, intermittently accompanied by apparent focal rhythmic diaphragmatic myoclonus after hydrocodone administration. Review of the literature disclosed a paucity of previous reports of hiccup, but many reports of myoclonus after opiate administration. A wide variety of opiates and routes of administration have been implicated, but high doses and the presence of other agents (antipsychotics, antiemetics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, antidepressants) may pose special risks. Review of the literature suggests three types of opiate- related myoclonus. Opiate-induced myoclonus (OIM) is often generalized and is either periodic or associated with rigidity. Opiate-induced myoclonus frequently occurs in the context of underlying medical conditions, D2 antagonist coadministration, or other drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antidepressants), and usually responds to either naloxone or benzodiazepines. Intrathecal OIM has not been linked to D2 antagonist coadministration or benzodiazepine responsiveness but may be associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Opiate withdrawal myoclonus may be stimulus- sensitive, associated with D2 antagonist coadministration, and responsive to benzodiazepines and unresponsive to naloxone. There are several problems in interpreting the literature, and more study is needed. Opiatergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and other mechanisms are considered.",

Fetal and neonatal pharmacokinetic alterations partly explain the neurobehavioral differences observed between different drug groups and ways of drug administration. The most effective and safest method with fewest neonatal neurobehavioral effects appears to be regional epidural analgesia performed with plain bupivacaine. The use of epidural opiates remains problematic. Inhalation agents and parenteral pethidine (meperidine) are still clinically useful alternative compounds in circumstances where epidural analgesia is not possible. Pharmacokinetically and according to neurobehavioral assessments, inhalation agents appear to be more attractive than pethidine. Benzodiazepines, especially after high or repeated doses, may cause the so-called floppy-infant syndrome, at least partly, due to a slow neonatal drug elimination.",

      "abstract": "The abuse of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), flunitrazepam, ketamine hydrochloride, and ᵞ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is discussed. Club drugs are chemical substances used recreationally in social settings. Use is increasingly frequent among young people, especially during all-night dance parties. All four agents have been classified as controlled substances. MDMA (\"ecstasy\") is available as a tablet, a capsule, and a powder; formulations may contain many adulterants. MDMA increases the release of neurotransmitters. The desired effects are euphoria, a feeling of intimacy, altered visual perception, enhanced libido, and increased energy. The most common adverse effects are agitation, anxiety, tachycardia, and hypertension. More serious adverse effects include arrhythmias, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis. Flunitrazepam is a potent benzodiazepine. At higher doses, the drug can cause lack of muscle control and loss of consciousness. Other adverse effects are hypotension, dizziness, confusion, and occasional aggression. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used primarily in veterinary practice. It may be injected, swallowed, snorted, or smoked. Like phencyclidine, ketamine interacts with the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel. Analgesic effects occur at lower doses and amnestic effects at higher doses. Cardiovascular and respiratory toxicity may occur, as well as confusion, hostility, and delirium. GHB, a naturally occurring fatty acid derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid, was introduced as a dietary supplement. Increasing doses progressively produce amnesia, drowsiness, dizziness, euphoria, seizures, coma, and death. Flunitrazepam, ketamine, and GHB have been used to facilitate sexual assault. Supportive care is indicated for most cases of club drug intoxication. The increasing abuse of MDMA, flunitrazepam, ketamine hydrochloride, and GHB, particularly by young people in social settings such as clubs, should put health care professionals on guard to recognize and manage serious reactions.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

Promethazine, promazine and propiomazine were not found to possess analgesic or potentiating properties. One chlorpromazine study contained important design and reporting deficiencies which precluded a recommendation for use of chlorpromazine in the treatment of pain. Methotrimeprazine was determined by numerous authors to have analgesic properties; however, most of the studies also were deficient in design or data presented, or both. Adverse reactions to phenothiazines, including hypotension, sedation, drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, cardiac toxicity and agranulocytosis, are often more common and severe than those attributed to narcotic analgesics. Because of the lack of data supportive of analgesic activity and the adverse reactions associated with phenothiazines, use of these agents in the management of pain should be discouraged. The prophylactic use of phenothiazine for narcotic analgesic-induced emesis also is, in most cases, a questionable practice.",

We recently published a Cochrane Review evaluating the effectiveness of levetiracetam, added on to usual care, in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The five most common adverse effects were reported and analysed with no scope for reporting any less common adverse effects than those. Here, we report and analyse the remaining adverse effects (including the five most common). These were (in decreasing order of frequency) somnolence; headache; asthenia; accidental injury; dizziness; infection; pharyngitis; pain; rhinitis; abdominal pain; flu syndrome; vomiting; diarrhoea; convulsion; nausea; increased cough; anorexia; upper respiratory tract infection; hostility; personality disorder; urinary tract infection; nervousness; depression; aggression; back pain; agitation; emotional liability; psychomotor hyperactivity; pyrexia; rash; ECG abnormalities; decreased appetite; nasal congestion; irritability; abnormal behaviour; epistaxis; insomnia; altered mood; anxiety; bloody urine; diplopia; dissociation; memory impairment; pruritis; increased appetite; acne; and stomach discomfort. Only somnolence and infection were significantly associated with levetiracetam. When adverse effects pertaining to infection were combined, these affected 19.7% and 15.1% of participants on levetiracetam and placebo (relative risk 1.16, CI 0.89-1.50, Chi(2) heterogeneity p = 0.13). Somnolence and infection further retained significance in adults while no single adverse effect was significant in children. This review updates the adverse effects profile data on levetiracetam use by empirically reporting its common and uncommon adverse effects and analysing their relative importance statistically using data from a group of trials that possess low Risk of Bias and high Quality of Evidence GRADE scores.",

      "abstract": "Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage1. Chronic pain is difficult to treat and often the interventions fail. This failure is, in part due to the fact that chronic pains usually result as a manifestation of some chronic degenerative, inflammatory or neoplastic process. As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs. The patient may not receive the treatment for appropriate time and dosage due to the side effects. Furthermore, indication of specific treatment modality depends upon the evidence of positive effects of the modality, as indicated in various control trials or the related literature2.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonic seizures are brief, involuntary muscular jerks arising from the central nervous system that can occur in different epilepsy syndromes, including idiopathic generalized epilepsies or the most severe group of epileptic encephalopathies. Valproate is commonly the first choice alone or in combination with some benzodiazepines or levetiracetam. However, more treatment options exist today as there is emerging evidence to support the efficacy of some newer antiepileptic drugs. In addition, of major importance remains avoidance of medications (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin) that may aggravate myoclonic seizures. This is an updated review on the available therapeutic options for treatment of myoclonic seizures. Areas covered: Key efficacy, tolerability and efficacy data are showed for different antiepileptic drugs with antimyoclonic effect, alone and/or in combination. Expert opinion: Pharmacological treatment of myoclonic seizures is based on clinical experience with little evidence from randomized clinical trials. Valproate, levetiracetam, and some benzodiazepines, are widely used. There is still insufficient evidence for the use of other antiseizure drugs, such as topiramate or zonisamide as monotherapy. Better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of myoclonic epilepsies could yield great improvement in the treatment and quality of life of patients.",

In this case report, we aimed to present a patient who experienced visual and tactile hallucinations after taking duloxetine for the complaint of diabetic neuropathic pain. Patient's hallucinations appeared after duloxetine dose increased and disappeared after duloxetine stopped. Duloxetine-induced hallucinations cases have been reported following the use of the drug in a few case levels. The etiology may be due to dopaminergic increase through the serotonergic system. In addition, multiple drug use and the presence of additional medical illness may also increase the risk of hallucination due to the metabolic interaction of duloxetine with other drugs.",

Wernicke's encephalopathy is an acute, neuropsychiatric syndrome resulting from thiamine deficiency, and has significant morbidity and mortality. Central nervous system neurotoxicity such as Wernicke's encephalopathy following chemotherapy with 5-FU has been reported rarely, although it has been suggested that 5-FU can produce adverse neurological effects by causing thiamine deficiency.

After excluding the other possible causes of chorea, phenytoin was withdrawn which resulted in a dramatic subsidence of chorea .On rechallenge with phenytoin patient again developed chorieform movements which again subsided after drug withdrawl, thus implicating phenytoin as the possible etiological agent for chorea Conclusion:Phenytoin rarely induces involuntary movements as adverse effect.During phenytoin therapy,if a patient develops involuntary movements,phenytoin toxicity should be suspected. Drug withdrawl leads to complete symptomatic improvement thereby avoiding extensive workup for other secondary causes.

      "abstract": "<h3>Objective:</h3> NA <h3>Background:</h3> Acquired drug-induced dyskinesias are common in late stage Parkinson's Disease after levodopa therapy. However, other drugs have been reported to cause acute hyperkinetic movements. Fentanyl has been shown to increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of the striatum. In an overdose study observing the effects of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, 1581 patients were enrolled. 31.4% had atypical features, 9.2% of which were dyskinesias. We present a case of transient generalized dyskinesias in a patient with pre-existing basal ganglia dysfunction from Parkinson's Disease, who was started on a fentanyl patch for pain management. <h3>Design/Methods:</h3> NA <h3>Results:</h3> 74-year old female with chronic low back pain and Parkinson's Disease (on medical therapy) had onset of excessive involuntary movements. Patient retained awareness while having involuntary, nonsuppressible writhing motion of the face, trunk and all limbs. Symptoms were nonpatterned– variable in timing, speed and direction. This lasted a day and self-resolved. Patient reported no changes to her Parkinson's medication regimen. She recently started a fentanyl patch (25mcg) the day prior and it was removed at the onset of her symptoms. Patient reported a similar episode one month prior during a minor procedure. Medication list from the facility included a dose of fentanyl for sedation. Her doctor noted she had involuntary writhing motions of her entire body that resolved a few hours later when anesthesia wore off. Laboratory studies did not reveal significant signs of inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, systemic infections or toxins. She underwent neurodiagnostic work-up: MRI brain with and without contrast did not reveal any signal changes or structural lesions in the basal ganglia; electroencephalogram was normal. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> In patients with preexisting basal ganglia dysfunction, a multidisciplinary approach should be considered when new medications are introduced. This case cautions the use of a common sedative in patients with Parkinson's Disease, which may cause generalized dyskinesias. <b>Disclosure:</b> Dr. Ly has nothing to disclose.

      "title": "Cauda Equina Syndrome following a Single Spinal Administration of 5% Hyperbaric Lidocaine through a 25-gauge Whitacre Needle",
      "abstract": "(Gerancher) Assistant Professor.Received from Department of Anesthesiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University Hospital, Stanford, California. Submitted for publication April 29, 1997. Accepted for publication June 5, 1997.Address reprint requests to Dr. Gerancher: Assistant Professor, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University Hospital, Stanford, California 94305.Key words: anesthetic techniques, spinal/anesthetics, local, lidocaine/complications, neurologic, cauda equina syndrome/toxicity, neurotoxicity.Cauda equina syndrome has been recognized as a rare, devastating complication of spinal anesthesia since Ferguson et al. [1]focused attention on the syndrome in 1937. The syndrome results when diffuse injury occurs across the lumbosacral nerve roots, producing varying degrees of three specific symptoms: saddle anesthesia, sphincter (bowel and bladder) dysfunction, and paraplegia. [2]Cauda equina syndrome has complicated spinal anesthesia administered with a single injection of dibucaine, piperocaine, procaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine. [3,4]Previously, lidocaine spinal anesthesia has been associated with cauda equina syndrome only when repeated, large doses of the drug were administered through a continuous spinal catheter. [5-10]We now report a case of cauda equina syndrome after single spinal injection of 100 mg lidocaine, 5%.A healthy 74-yr-old man was scheduled for elective inguinal hernia repair during spinal anesthesia. With the patient in sitting position, clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained at the L3-L4 interspace with a single insertion of a 25-gauge Whitacre spinal needle using an unexpired, custom-supplied spinal tray (B. Braun Medical, Bethlehem, PA). Approximately 0.2 ml of CSF were aspirated before the injection of 100 mg of 5% lidocaine in 7.5% dextrose (Astra USA Inc., Westborough, MA), with 0.2 mg of epinephrine (Elkins-Sinn Inc., Cherry Hill, NJ) added. The direction of the spinal needle side-port and the speed of injection were not noted, and CSF was not aspirated after injection. No blood or paresthesia was encountered during placement. A T8 upper sensory level was obtained to testing by pinprick, and adequate surgical anesthesia was present. The patient received 1000 cc of lactated Ringer's solution, 2 mg of midazolam (Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ) intravenously for sedation, experienced no hypotension, and required no pharmacologic blood pressure support.The patient's upper sensory spinal level receded to T10 in the postanesthesia care unit, and he was able to move his legs on arrival to his day surgery room 1 h after the completion of surgery. Approximately 12 h after initiation of spinal anesthesia, the patient was ambulating but complaining of a numb perineum and the inability to void. He was then easily catheterized, spent 24 h in the hospital, and was discharged with an indwelling urinary catheter and an initial diagnosis of mechanical bladder outlet obstruction. After 3 days, at follow-up examination with his surgeon, he had no improvement in his symptoms and complained of persistent constipation.Subsequent urologic evaluation 6 days after surgery revealed a saddle distribution of sensory deficit, a decreased bulbocavernosus reflex, an intact anal reflex, and a small prostate and normal bladder without evidence of mechanical obstruction on cystoscopic examination. Cauda equina syndrome was suspected, and neurologic consultation was obtained at 3 weeks. Neurologic assessment was consistent with a diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome, revealing hypesthesia in the S2-S4 dermatomes. Results of a magnetic resonance image (MRI) without contrast were normal, and those of a cystometrogram after 4 months were consistent with a diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome demonstrating normal sensation, normal capacity, and detrusor hyporeflexia. Five months after surgery, the patient is able to have spontaneous bowel movements on a high fiber diet but still has perineal hypesthesia and remains unable to void spontaneously. The manufacturers of the custom spinal trays and of the spinal medications have been contacted.This patient's symptoms of perineal anesthesia, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and decreased reflexes are consistent with cauda equina syndrome and are similar to all the previously reported cases (Table 1). Just how a modern spinal anesthetic might be associated with cauda equina syndrome has been the focus of considerable investigation and debate. Maldistribution of hyperbaric local anesthetics has been implicated [11]because many of the patients with cauda equina syndrome had inadequate continuous spinal anesthesia despite repeated and relatively large local anesthetic doses. Evidence generated in spinal models in vitro suggests that neurotoxic concentrations of local anesthetics are attainable when repeated doses of hyperbaric local anesthetic are administered through a continuous spinal catheter. [7,12,13]Single doses of hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, administered in spinal models through 25-gauge and 27-gauge Whitacre needles also can produce maldistribution [14]and potentially neurotoxic concentrations. [15]The neurotoxic potential of lidocaine has been most recently characterized in vivo in a rat model with the spinal administration of lidocaine, 5%, wherein toxicity is not altered by the presence of 7.5% glucose [16]but is enhanced by the presence of epinephrine.*When hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, has been used clinically in the absence of a spinal catheter, neurologic deficits consistent with maldistribution or neurotoxicity have been rare. Two instances of isolated sensory deficits have been reported. [15]One report was of a prolonged, but transient perineal hypesthesia in a volunteer who received 100 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, via a 25-gauge Whitacre needle; the other was a report of permanent perineal hypesthesia in a volunteer who received 200 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, in two administrations via separate 27-g Whitacre needles. Cauda equina syndrome not been described before the current report. Despite this record of clinical safety over the past 40 yr, Astra USA has revised the prescribing information for hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, as discussed in a recent \"Dear doctor\" letter (Table 2), [17]referring to the reported cases of cauda equina syndrome after repeated injection, animal and in vitro studies, and recent reports of \"transient postoperative radicular pain associated with 5% lidocaine.\"This new prescribing information was not present in the package insert used in this case report; these new guidelines were not followed, and there still remains no definite clinical evidence that following them would have prevented cauda equina syndrome in this patient. This report serves to document that spinal anesthesia administered in a single injection through a small gauge pencil tip needle, epinephrine, and as little as 100 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine, 5%, have now been associated with cauda equina syndrome.*Hashimoto K, Nakamura Y, Hampl K, Ciriales R, Bollen A, Drasner K: Epinepherine increases the neurotoxic potential of intrathetically administered local anesthetic in the rat (Abstract pending publication per Drasner K).

      "abstract": "Accurate certification of deaths in custody that occur either during or immediately following contact with law enforcement personnel (especially physical contact) involves consideration of one or more modalities of contact. These modalities include physical restraint (hand/ankle cuffing, prone positioning, application of pressure on the torso and/or limbs, maximal prone restraint, application of conducted electrical weapons) and chemical restraints (lacrimal agents/chemical irritants) in the setting of psychotic illness/agitation, struggle/physical exertion, intoxication with stimulant drugs and underlying cardiovascular pathology that can predispose to sudden death. Assessment of these case are often not straightforward, and their certification can be some of the most difficult cases that a forensic pathologist can be faced with in respect to the determination of both cause manner of death. Perceived unfair and/or unpopular certifications of these cases can result in professional criticism, allegations of bias, complicity or bias by certifying pathologist, social dissatisfaction/unrest and violent public protests. Recent deaths in custody in the United States (US) are typical examples of this phenomenon. This Chapter outlines the main clinicopathologic considerations that must occur in the pathologic assessment of these cases",

      "abstract": "Neurologic adverse effects of triazole antifungal compounds used for the treatment of systemic and deep mycoses are relatively rare. The most common presentation is the involvement of peripheral nervous system, usually presenting with subjective symptoms such as paresthesia, dysesthesia, or numbness. Among these compounds, fluconazole has relatively more frequent neurological adverse reactions.A 54-year-old man was admitted with numbness and weakness in his both feet, which gradually worsened and resulted in difficulty in ambulation over time. He had no morbidity other than hypertension. He developed polyneuropathy (PNP), lower gastrointestinal system bleeding, acute renal insufficiency, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and confusional state. Severely disabling axonal and demyelinating sensorimotor PNP which led to immobilization of the patient for a few weeks but was recovered. When a more detailed past medical history was taken, he admitted to ingestion of 200 mg/day fluconazole for 1 month for onychomycosis without any prescription. This unusual combination of these rare adverse reactions of fluconazole may be explained by activation of an immune mechanism triggered by the drugs and genetic factors, or some other unknown individual factors.This case is reported due to the presence of rare systemic and neurologic adverse events of fluconazole, leading to this unusual clinical picture. We would like to emphasize fluconazole-related systemic and neurologic adverse reactions with life-threatening potential should be kept in mind.",

      "title": "Psychedelics: Overlooked Clinical Tools with Unexplored Ergogenic Potential",
      "abstract": "Psychedelics are a stigmatized, under-researched class of hallucinogenic drugs with unprecedented boundless potential. Despite a historically widespread cultural use, these drugs were denigrated and prematurely banned before clinical trials could demonstrate their value. It is now known that through full or partial serotonergic receptor agonist activity, psychedelics impart positive effects on a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive- compulsive behaviors. Furthermore, extremely small, non-intoxifying microdosed psychedelics (1/10th-1/16th typical dose) may potentiate similar effects to full doses without undesirable side effects. These compounds are also unexplored for their potential role in physically active populations. A preponderance of subjective claims and fervent anecdote indicate psychedelics may enhance mental acuity and subsequent exercise performance. Through the same serotonergic-mediated mechanisms that invoke neuroplasticity, psychedelics possibly augment exercise adaptation and offer safer alternatives to current pain management strategies. Despite a wealth of promising clinical data and high drug safety, federal restriction remains a psychological barrier to research and general public acceptance. Therefore, the purpose of this short review is to 1) briefly demonstrate the clinical value of psychedelics, and 2) highlight the potential of microdosing as an effective alternative to full-dose psychedelics whilst emphasizing their latent ergogenic ability.",

These movement disorders disappeared when the drug was stopped and reappeared when the patient was challenged. Throughout the period of treatment, concentrations of phenytoin in serum were consistently low within the therapeutic range. Interfering symptoms from the cardiovascular system and the absence of some classic symptoms of phenytoin intoxication (nystagmus and dysarthria) contributed to delay the diagnosis. The patient died in hospital and autopsy of the brain showed rather localized encephalomalacies of corpus striatum. The pathogenic action of phenytoin and the role of preexisting brain lesions are discussed. Phenytoin must be suspected as the cause, when patients on this drug present with uncontrollable epilepsy or neurological or mental deterioration.",

      "title": "Seizure Possibly Associated with Fluvoxamine",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To inform clinicians of the possibility that seizures due to therapeutic doses of fluvoxamine may not be as rare as previously considered. CASE SUMMARY: A 49-year-old white man with schizoaffective disorder and a past history of seizures secondary to head trauma had been seizure-free for approximately 10 years. Fluvoxamine therapy was begun due to increasing obsessive—compulsive behavior. Despite receiving anticonvulsants for his mood disorder, the patient had a breakthrough seizure. There were no underlying medical conditions that might have induced this seizure. No further seizures occurred after he was placed on a higher dosage of the anticonvulsants. The obsessive—compulsive behavior improved considerably as a result of fluvoxamine treatment. DISCUSSION: The patient presented here developed a seizure with a therapeutic dosage of fluvoxamine; seizures associated with this agent have occurred more often with overdose. Multiple factors such as a prior history of seizures, head trauma, and concurrent treatment with other psychotropic agents are considered in this case report. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively safe and benign adverse effect profile of the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors such as fluvoxamine, clinicians should be cautious about seizures as an adverse effect, especially when the patient has even a remote history of seizure or head trauma.",

      "abstract": "The aggressive and effective management of severe pain has been a relatively neglected part of overall medical practice. Because pain is not objectively measurable, it is a symptom vulnerable to being overlooked or underestimated in the assessment of health status. Even when the need for pain management is recognized by clinicians, treatment options are often limited by fears of prescription-narcotic analgesic abuse or addiction. Moreover, severe pain is often poorly responsive to existing treatment modalities. For example, of the approximately 9 million people worldwide who develop cancer each year, 60-90% suffer from moderate-to-severe pain (1). In severe pain, intraspinal opioid delivery may be required to obtain adequate relief; however, it has been reported that intraspinal opioids are ineffective in approximately 26% of such clinical situations (2), and even when effective, development of tolerance or adverse effects can lead to treatment failure. Moreover, noncancer patients with neuropathic pain arising from injury to peripheral nerves, spinal cord, or brain are often treatment-resistant or else require intolerably high or stupefying doses of opioids to achieve relief. Thus, a clear need exists for effective nonopioid analgesic agents with acceptable side effect profiles for long-term administration in both malignant and nonmalignant chronic pain settings.",

      "abstract": "Fluctuations in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), such as wearing-off and on–off effects, and dyskinesias are related to a variety of factors, including duration and dosage of levodopa, age at onset, stress, sleep, food intake, and other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. The majority of patients, particularly those with young onset of PD, experience these levodopa-related adverse effects after a few years of treatment. Assessment of these motor complications is difficult because of the marked clinical variability between and within patients. Daily diaries have been used in clinical trials designed to assess the effects of various pharmacological and surgical interventions on motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. The most common type of dyskinesia, called \"peak-dose dyskinesia\", usually consists of stereotypical choreic or ballistic movements involving the head, trunk, and limbs, and occasionally, the respiratory muscles, whereas tremor and punding are less-common complications. Dystonia is also typically seen in patients with diphasic dyskinesia and wearing-off effect. Recognition of the full spectrum of clinical phenomenology of levodopa-related motor complications is essential for their treatment and prevention. © 2005 Movement Disorder Society",

The two drugs used, epinephrine and methacholine, often stimulate frank anxiety attacks or somatic symptoms, which are typical of the patient's usual complaints. Because of the apparent, albeit inconsistent, relationship between psychological phenomena and epileptic seizures, we were interested in finding out whether or not epinephrine, methacholine, or both would have the same activating effect on epileptic patients as it did on psychiatric patients.

Acute dystonia is a well-known extrapyramidal side effect of dopamine receptor antagonists. The oculogyric crisis, a specific form of acute dystonic reaction, refers to usually upward and sometimes lateral deviation of the eyes for a certain period due to contraction of the extraocular eye muscles. Despite the increase in dopamine-related activity, psychostimulants were also reported to cause dystonic reactions rather than blocking. In this study, a patient with oculogyric crisis after the initiation of methylphenidate treatment was analyzed. Although rarely observed, dystonic reactions that may occur after methylphenidate should be considered by clinicians.",

Objectives Presentation of a clinical case of a PNES in a patient with a diagnose of secondary epilepsy, illustrating the relevance of an adequate evaluation, differential diagnosis, and intervention. Methods Description of the clinical case, with brief literature review and discussion. A search was conducted on PubMed and other databases, using the MeSH terms “nonepileptic seizure”, and “epileptic seizure”. Results We report the case of a 45-year-old female patient, brought to the emergency department because of tonic axial and limb nonsynchronous movements, closed eyes, long duration, with immediate awareness, no desaturation, tongue bite, facial flushing, dyspnoea or sphincter incontinency. She was medicated with clonazepam 1 mg and levetiracetam 1000 mg ev. TC-CE had no acute alteration. Bloodwork had no other major alteration except valproic acid below therapeutic levels (her usual medication, along with other antiepileptic drugs, antidepressant and antipsychotic). The antecedents of the patient: mild intellectual disability and an accidental traumatic brain injury in infancy, with secondary epilepsy. She was transferred to Psychiatry department. No electroencephalogram (EEG) was realized, because she had a recent one confirming PNES, and many other emergency observations with the diagnosis of PNES. Conclusions This clinical case showcases the diagnostic difficulties that clinicians face when there is an overlap in symptoms, emphasizing the need to combine patient history, witness reports, clinician observations, and ictal and interictal EEG to help distinguish these different clinical identities.

It has been found that the most often found consequence of that treatment is conversive neurosis, and subsequently the hypochondriac syndrome. On an average an acute non-allergic reaction occurred after the sixth injection. In 94% of the patients the neurotic symptoms appeared immediately after the described reaction. A positive correlation between the patient's age and an intensity of the converse symptoms was found. The Hoigne'a syndrome was a strong mental trauma, and was treated as an allergic shock for all of the patients. The patients were afraid of the next injection and they all refused to give permission for the continuation of such treatment. Neurotic syndromes related to Hoigne's syndrome turned out to be prolonged with a tendency for relapses, and low susceptibility to different methods of treatment. The mechanism of non-allergic acute reaction after procaine penicillin and ways of its prevention are also discussed.",

A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

Altered mental status e. False localizing signs (such as cranial nerve [CN] VI palsy) f. Increased intracranial pressure may be due to mass effectattributable to tumor, surrounding edema and hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus2. Focal neurologic dysfunction a. Seizures: most often partial, some with secondary gener-alization, common with temporal lobe tumors b. Focal signs and symptoms are highly dependent onlocalization of the tumor 3.

Low-grade (WHO grade II) diffuse astrocytomasa. Associated with mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 on chromosome 17p13.1 in two-thirds of cases andg. Neuroimaging characteristics: T2 hyperintense lesions with little to no enhancement, edema, or hemorrhageh. Prognosis 1) Survival is variable (at least 3-5 years is expected) 2) Most low-grade astrocytomas undergo malignanttransformation with time 3) Risk factors for malignant transformation: tumorsize, gemistocytic pathology, presentation in first decade or after age 50 years, increased enhancement2. Anaplastic (WHO grade III) astrocytoma a. Associated with mutations of the tumor suppressor genep53 on chromosome 17p13.1 (as with the low-grade astrocytomas), mutation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 13q14 in 1/3 of cases, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 19q (the latter two are involved in transformation from a low-grade to an anaplastic astrocytoma)b. Presentation is often between 40 and 60 years of age (younger patients have longer survival)c. Mascroscopic features 1) Diffusely infiltrating heterogeneous neoplasm 2) Tumor may appear cystic and/or contain hemorrhagicfoci d. Microscopic features1) Cellular proliferation is more prominent than in lowgrade astrocytomas2) Often, frequent mitotic figures and endovascular proliferation3) No necrosis e. Seeding of the neuroaxis by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)dissemination and ependymal spread may occur but are rareoverexpression of proto-oncogene encoding plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)b. Occur typically in either first decade or between third and fourth decadesc. Usually hemispheric location, with predilection for temporal and posterior frontal lobes more than anterior parietal lobed. Tends to be infiltrative, with no well-defined borders e. Seizure is common presentation f. Pathology1) Pattern (from most common to least common): often fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic astrocytomas2) Fibrillary astrocytomas (Fig. 16-1) a) Well-differentiated astrocytes with scant cyto-plasm; atypical and hyperchromatic nuclei; fine, fibrillary processesb) Microcysts containing mucinous material c) Scant to absent mitotic figures and vascularproliferation d) Calcification is rare but may occur in up to 10% to20% of cases 3) Protoplasmic astrocytomasa) Hypocellular b) Cells with small round nuclei, sparse cytoplasm c) Prominent characteristic microcystic spaces4) Gemistocytic astrocytomas (Fig. 16-2) a) Large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasmand eccentrically placed nuclei b) Usually worse prognosis c) Malignant transformation: more often than otherpathologic subtypesTable 16-1. WHO Classification and St. Anne/Mayo Grading of Astrocytic TumorsWHO St. Anne/Mayo_______________________________ ________________________________________________________ Designation Classification Grade (based on criteria)* Criteria*f. Median survival: usual estimate, about 2 to 3 years after presentation3. Glioblastoma multiforme a. Most common primary brain tumor, 50% of all gliomas b. Presentation: typically after age 50 c. With the aggressive nature and rapid progression,presenting symptoms include increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and focal neurologic symptomsd. Genetics 1) Secondary glioblastomas (malignant transformationof lower grade glioma to glioblastoma) can be associated with mutation of gene encoding PDGF-α, loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN (LOH at chromosome 10q)2) Primary (de novo) glioblastomas a) Have no apparent antecedent low-or intermediate-grade tumor history b) Are often associated with amplification of theproto-oncogenes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MDM2, loss of tumor suppressorgene PTEN, LOH at chromosome 10, and mutation involving the RB genee. Most common locations: deep white matter and deep gray matter, including thalamus and basal gangliaf. Macroscopic and neuroimaging features 1) Heterogeneous-appearing mass with foci of necrosis,hemorrhage, and peritumoral edema (Fig. 16-3) 2) Neuroimaging often confirms the heterogeneousappearance, with central area of necrosis and a ringenhancing rim3) Despite the circumscribed gross appearance, thetumor is highly infiltrative and may also spread to opposite hemisphere through the corpus callosum (“butterfly gliomas”)4) Glioblastoma multiforme tumors may arise from malignant transformation of separate regions of the tumor and appear multifocal5) Contrast enhancement and vasogenic edema occur from disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB)6) Treatment with corticosteroids assists in reestablishment of BBB and can yield almost immediate improvement of symptomsg. Microscopic features 1) All the features of anaplastic astrocytomas in additionto prominent endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, surrounded by pseudopalisading of cells (Fig. 16-4)2) Neovascularization and endothelial hyperplasia may be due to production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)h. Natural history and spread 1) Typical: spread of tumor along white matter tractsand around the ependyma 2) Atypical: CSF dissemination through neuroaxis(occurs in 10%-20% of cases), may include pachymeningeal spread3) Almost never occur: invasion of dura mater and metastasis outside of CNS4) Meningeal invasion is sometimes called “meningeal gliomatosis,” occurs more frequently with malignant gliomasi. Treatment 1) Usually includes surgical debulking aimed at relievingmass effect and increasing effectiveness of adjunctive therapy (also sometimes to obtain pathology specimen)2) Complete resection is not possible because tumor is diffusely infiltrative and multifocal3) Stereotactic biopsy: reserved for deep and inaccessibletumors and comorbidities precluding general anesthesia 4) Most effective adjunctive therapy: external beamradiotherapy administered to limited field, up to 60 Gy given in conjunction with temozolomide chemotherapy-median survival, about 14 months; 2-year survival, about 27%4. Gliomatosis cerebri (Fig. 16-5) a. Diffuse, infiltrative glial tumor (usually astrocytoma)causing diffuse expansion of a portion of or entire cerebral hemisphere; may spread to one or both cerebral hemispheresb. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-6) 1) Resembles low-grade glioma 2) Mild increase in cellularity and pleomorphism 3) Rare mitotic figures 4) No hemorrhage or necrosis 5) Neoplastic glial cells cluster around neuronsc. Treatment 1) Some benefit from chemotherapy (as with PCV ortemozolamide) 2) No role for surgery because of infiltrative nature oftumorg. Brainstem gliomas: likely to be solid, diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas (rarely pilocytic tumor arising from fourth ventricle with “dorsally exophytic” growth, which may portend better prognosis)h. Macroscopic features: unencapsulated, but well-circumscribed (there may be limited degrees of infiltration) heterogeneous mass; may have a mural nodule associated with a cysti. Microscopic features 1) Compact pilocytic arrangements of elongated (some-times stellate) cells admixed with microcystic areas 2) Classic feature: abundant Rosenthal fibers, may beslight nuclear pleomorphism and rare mitoses j. 5-Year postoperative survival: 85% to 100% (95%-100% for cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas) k. Cerbellar pilocytic astrocytomas have the best prognosisof all primary brain tumors l. Treatment1) Maximal surgical excision of tumor 2) Surgical excision of the mural nodule may be3) Marginal benefit from radiotherapy d. 2-Year survival after treatment, 5% to 10%E. Circumscribed Astrocytomas 1. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Usually occur in first or second decade of life b. Better prognosis than diffuse astrocytomas c. Common locations: cerebellum (hemispheres &gt; vermis),optic chiasm, hypothalamus, and periventricular area of third and fourth ventricles (Fig. 16-7 A)d. Less common locations: spinal cord (Fig. 16-7 B and C), brainstem, cerebral hemispheres (temporal lobe is most common hemisphere site); tend to occur in older age group (young adults)e. Cerebellar hemisphere tumors: often large cystic, fluidfilled masses appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with strongly (but somewhat heterogeneously) contrast-enhancing mural nodulef. Optic and hypothalamic gliomas: tend to be solid, pilocytic tumorsadequate and cystic wall need not be removed 3) With increasing thickness or enhancement of nodulewall, the cystic wall also needs to be removed 4) Nonresectable tumors or recurrence with malignanttransformation may require adjuvant radiotherapy 2. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (WHO grade II orIII) a. Occur in second or third decade of life (average age atdiagnosis, 26 years) b. Often a history of seizures c. May originate from subpial astrocytes d. Macroscopic features1) Well-encapsulated tumor frequently containing a mural nodule within a cyst2) Often located superficially in temporal lobe e. Microsocopic features1) Large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, some containing lipid droplets2) Nuclear pleomorphism 3) Rare mitosesf. Neuroimaging: well-circumscribed cystic lesions appearing isointense or hypointense to brain parenchyma on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images,often with intense contrast enhancement of nodule g. Treatment1) Often includes complete resection 2) Radiation and chemotherapy often reserved forrecurrent or malignant tumors h. Postresection survival rates: 81% at 5 years, 70% at10 years; relatively benign prognosis 3. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Very slow-growing tumors, always associated with tuberous sclerosis (found in up to 14% of patients with tuberous sclerosis)b. Presentation: usually in first or second decade of life c. Usually originate near foramen of Monro, blocking CSFoutflow and causing hydrocephalus d. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, lobulated redmass (vascular tumor), often calcified and cysticLarge cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic granular bodies are a characteristic feature of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which is a low-grade gliomae. Microscopic features 1) Large, oval cells with abundant eosinophilic cyto-plasm and large, eccentric nucleus; often surround blood vessels in this vascular tumor2) Pleomorphism is often present 3) Mitoses and necrosis are unusualf. Neuroimaging: isointense or hyperintense on T2weighted images; intense, heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted imaging with contrastg. Definitive treatment for symptomatic patients (i.e., hydrocephalus) or extensive tumors: surgical resectionh. Unless symptomatic, patients are only followed with periodic neuroimagingF. Special Considerations 1. Optic gliomas (Fig. 16-8)a. 3% to 5% of all childhood brain tumors b. 2% of gliomas in adults c. Female predominance (female:male = 2:1) d. More common in children: 50% of patients presentbefore age 5, 90% before age 20 e. Tumors involving optic nerve alone have a betterprognosis than those involving optic chiasm (which have better prognosis than hypothalamic gliomas, although aggressive tumors involving optic chiasm may spread to involve hypothalamus)f. Associated with NF1 1) Occur in 1% to 7% of children with NF1 2) As many as 50% of patients with optic gliomas haveNF1 3) Almost all patients with bilateral optic nerve tumorssparing optic chiasm have NF1 g. Slow-growing tumors; malignant histologic features oraggressive behavior are rare (reported in cases of optic chiasm and hypothalamic gliomas)h. Usually pilocytic astrocytomas causing either diffuse expansion without subarachnoid involvement or primary subarachnoid spread with minimal involvement of optic nervei. Symptoms unique to optic nerve gliomas 1) Visual loss, visual field defects, painless proptosis, andsymptoms related to increased intracranial pressure 2) Symptoms of hypothalamic involvementa) Endocrinopathies: precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, other related endocrinopathiesb) Gelastic seizures: characterized by involuntarylaughter, more common with hypothalamic hamartomasc) “Diencephalic syndrome”: emaciation, cachexia and loss of subcutaneous fat, emesis, pallor, hyperactivity, inappropriate behavior, euphoriaj. Treatment 1) Considered for tumors with aggressive behavior, espe-cially for patients presenting with visual deterioration 2) Radiotherapy considered for patients older than 5years presenting with tumors in locations other than intraorbital (intracranial locations such as chiasmal or retrochiasmal) and when total resection is not possible3) Chemotherapy considered for patients younger than 5 years4) Surgical excision may be limited to biopsy, especially for tumors involving optic chiasm2. Brainstem gliomas a. Account for 10% to 15% of brain tumors in children(&lt;5% of gliomas in adults) b. Age at diagnosis: often between 5 and 10 years c. Heterogeneous group of neoplasms: all grades of pathol-ogy observed, but most are malignant, with poor prognosisd. Symptoms: usually related to ataxia and other cerebellarfeatures, long tract signs, or cranial nerve deficits e. Neuroimaging (can predict prognosis better than patho-logic features) 1) Lesions appear as a high T2 signal with variabledegrees of enhancement 2) May contain a cystic component (Fig. 16-9) 3) Diffuse pontine gliomas: all are malignant 4) Most gliomas involving cervicomedullary junction arelow-grade gliomas 5) Tumors of midbrain usually have a better prognosisthan those involving medulla or pons 6) Dorsal exophytic tumors tend to have betterprognosis f. Prognosis1) Best for focal lesions, dorsal exophytic tumors, low histologic grade, longer period from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, adult age group, and in context of neurofibromatosis2) 5-Year survival: 5% to 30% g. Treatment1) Best: radiotherapy 2) Surgical resection usually involves stereotactic biopsy;is best performed on focal, cystic, or exophytic tumorsG. Rare Astrocytic Variants 1. Gliosarcomas: high-grade gliomas admixed with sarco-ma (variant of glioblastoma multiforme, with same prognosis)2. Gliofibroma a. Glioma admixed with population of cells resemblingfibroblasts b. Usually present in the first decadeH. Oligodendroglioma 1. From cells of oligodendroglial origin (O2A progenitorcells)2. Genetics a. Development of low-grade oligodendrogliomas: associ-ated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p, 19q, and 4qb. Development of high-grade oligodendrogliomas from the low-grade tumors: associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 9p and 10qc. Both are associated with overexpression of EGFR 3. Account for 5% of all primary brain tumors and 30%of all intracranial gliomas 4. May be a male predominance (male:female = 3:2) 5. More often presents in adults: usually present betweenthird and fifth decades 6. Small earlier peak in childhood between 6 and 12 years;thalamic location at presentation is common in children7. Seizures are often the initial presentation in up to 75% of patients because tumor commonly involves cerebral cortex8. Most common location: frontal lobe, followed by temporal and parietal lobes; rarely brainstem or spinal cord9. Slow-growing, infiltrative gliomas: may start in subcortical white matter, tend to spread along white matter tracts and corpus callosum10. Better prognosis than astrocytomas 11. 5-Year survival rate, 75% 12. Mean postoperative survival, 4 to 11 years13. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, unencapsulated mass with cystic degeneration and calcification (necrosis and hemorrhage are rare)14. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-10) a. Variable b. Homogeneously appearing cells with sparse cytoplasmand round, uniform nuclei c. Cells may appear elongated, with a displaced nucleus;because of fixation artifact, there may be artifactual clearing of the cytoplasm, resembling fried eggsd. There may be mucin-rich microcystic spaces e. Capillaries interposed between uniform-appearing cellsmay form a delicate vascular “chicken-wire” pattern f. Pleomorphism and endothelial hyperplasia (less commonly,necrosis) indicate high-grade oligodendroglioma 15. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous appearing T2hyperintense mass often involving cerebral cortex with variable, heterogeneous enhancement pattern, cystic component, and calcification (in up to 90% of cases)16. Classified into high-grade and low-grade tumors 17. Features associated with high-grade tumors and lessfavorable prognosis a. Contrast enhancement b. Endothelial proliferation c. Mitotic figures d. More than 5% of MIB-1 staining e. Astrocytic component (with oligoastrocytomas, asdiscussed below) 18. Treatmenta. Gross total resection when possible (because tumor is infiltrative, microscopic infiltrates always remain)b. Primary adjuvant therapy: chemotherapy with alkylating agent such as temozolomide (before development of temozolomide, procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine [PVC] were used)c. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 1p or combined loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 19q (50%- 80% of cases) portend better prognosis, prolonged survival, and better response to chemotherapyd. Although intermediate-grade oligodendrogliomas are often chemotherapy-responsive (e.g., 1p/19q deleted tumors), radiation (often in combination with chemotherapy) is still the mainstay of treatment to achieve maximal survival advantageI. Oligoastrocytoma 1. Composed of different populations of cells, someresembling astrocytes, some oligodendrocytes, and some indeterminate2. A common progenitor cell that differentiates into two different cell lines is likely3. Glial tumors with predominant oligodendrocytic population of cells are often interpreted as oligodendrocytes4. Increasing proportion of oligodendroglial component generally portends better prognosis (chromosome 1p and 19q deletions signify greater sensitivity of tumor to chemotherapy)J. Ependymoma 1. Epidemiologya. 5% to 8% of all primary intracranial tumors b. Age at presentation often in the first decade, with asecond peak in the fourth decade (prognosis worse for patients younger than 3 years)c. Third most common brain tumor in children d. Location (pediatric population): intracranial (90%) orspinal cord (10%) e. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occuring in childrenare infratentorial and about 1/3 supratentorial f. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occur in children (mostlyinfratentorial), and more than 90% of spinal cord ependymomas occur in adults (mostly myxopapillary ependymomas)2. Symptoms at presentation (depend largely on tumor location) a. Intracranial tumors often occur on floor (more frequentthan roof or lateral recesses) of fourth ventricle (medul-loblastomas tend to arise most frequently from roof of fourth ventricle)b. May present with obstructive hydrocephalus and associated symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus3. Potential for CSF dissemination: because of close contact with CSF, there may be “drop metastasis” in 5% of cases4. Myxopapillary ependymomas a. Well-encapsulated, indolent, slow-growing vasculartumors arising from filum terminale b. Occur most often in adults c. Associated with good prognosis5. Posterior fossa ependymomas a. Well-demarcated tumors that tend to fill fourth ventricleand extend through foramen magnum b. Appear as T2 hyperintense masses with heterogeneoussignal that may represent tumor vascularity (or necrosis) c. Often a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement6. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-11) a. Sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei and variablecytoplasm among perivascular anuclear fibrillary processes: “pseudorosettes” (fine cellular fibrillary processes that radiate toward blood vessel)b. Myxopapillary ependymomas are characterized by sheets of uniform columnar or cuboidal cells admixed with pools of mucin often bordered by tumor cells and containing a central blood vesselc. Cytologic pleomorphism, necrosis, mitotic figures, and giant cells often signify anaplastic ependymomas7. Treatment: surgical resection and/or adjuvant radiotherapy (optimal outcome with doses between 5,000 cGy and 5,500 cGy) a. Higher survival with gross total resection: goal is toobtain maximal possible resection b. For low-grade ependymomas of spine parenchyma orfilum terminale (myxopapillary ependymoma): surgical resection is mainstay of treatment, radiation is considered if residual tumor is present postoperativelyc. Extensive craniospinal radiation to entire neuroaxis required for patients presenting with CSF disseminationd. Response to chemotherapy is suboptimal; this treatment modality is considered for patients with contraindications to radiation (e.g., children younger than 3 years or patients with recurrent disease )8. Prognosis: generally favorable, especially adults with myxopapillary ependymomas (except for 10%-20% of cases that have CSF dissemination)9. Reduced survival has been associated with young age at onset and anaplastic histopathologic features, and higher risk of recurrence with partial resectionsK. Subependymoma 1. Slow-growing large firm masses most often occurring infourth ventricle, arising from medulla or lateral ventricles attached to septum pellucidum2. Age at presentation: usually between 40 and 60 years 3. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-12): cells with roundnuclei and sparse cytoplasm; admixed with microcystic clusters and foci of calcification on a fibrillary background4. Neuroimaging characteristics: mildly hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images often with heterogeneous appearance and little to no enhancementA. Ganglion Cell Neoplasms 1. Rare, slow-growing, benign well-circumscribed firmtumors often occurring in temporal lobes, sometimes with cystic or calcified foci2. Age at presentation: first 3 decades 3. Most common presentation: seizures (oftenintractable) 4. Predilection for temporal lobes (followed by frontal andparietal lobes); much less common, cerebellum and spinal cord5. Neuroimaging characteristics: classically appear as well-circumscribed cystic mass (hyperintense on T2weighted images) with a mural nodule with variable enhancement6. Microscopic features a. Presence of both neuronal (ganglion) and glial neoplasticcells b. Gangliocytoma: tumors with predominance ofneoplastic ganglion cells without an obvious astrocytic componentc. Ganglioglioma: tumors containing neoplastic glial cells that often outnumber ganglion cellsd. Some neoplastic ganglion cells are binucleated or multinucleated (unfortunately not always present, but quite helpful when present) (Fig. 16-13)7. Treatment a. Resection b. Radiotherapy: reserved for recurrent tumor or thosewith anaplastic histopathologic features 8. Prognosisa. Most carry benign prognosis with total or subtotal resectionb. Anaplastic histopathologic features: less favorable prognosisB. Central Neurocytomas 1. Neoplasms of neuronal differentiation 2. Rare (about 0.5% of all primary CNS tumors), occurprimarily in young adults between second and fourth decades3. Commonly present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (most commonly, headaches)4. Most commonly an intraventricular location, often at foramen of Monro: 50% of all intraventricular tumors in adults5. Microscopic features: sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei; immunoreactive for synaptophysin6. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous signal (isointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted images) with heterogeneous enhancement (Fig. 6-14)7. Treatment often involves resection (total, if possible) 8. Benign prognosis with total or subtotal resection, withlong survival ratesC. Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNET) 1. Rare, slow-growing (sometimes cystic) tumors withpredilection for temporal lobes 2. Most common presentation: complex partial seizures(often intractable) 3. Microscopic featuresa.

Neuroimaging characteristics: hyperintense on T2weighted images (hypointense on T1-weighted images)5. Benign prognosis 6. Surgical resection usually reserved for symptomaticcases (e.g., intractable seizures)D. Lhermitte-Duclos Disease (dysplastic gangliocytoma of cerebellum)1. Commonly presents as slow-growing cerebellar mass with increased intracranial pressure2. Commonly presents in the fourth decade 3. Associated with Cowden’s disease (about 50% ofpatients with dysplastic gangliocytoma have clinical stigmata of Cowden’s disease)4. Macroscopic features: hypertrophied, thickened cerebellar folia (Fig. 16-15)5. Microscopic features a. Enlarged ganglion cells (neurons) replace granule cells,atrophy of granular layer b. Loss of Purkinje cells c. Reduction and cavitation of cerebellar white matter6. Neuroimaging: laminated increased T2 signal without enhancementE. Desmoplastic Infantile Astrocytoma (DIA) and Ganglioma (DIG)1. Rare, often occurring in the first 2 years of life 2. Large, cystic tumors with dural attachments, andpredilection for frontal and parietal areas 3. DIG has male predominance, DIA femalepredominance 4. DIG as",

      "title": "Jitteriness/anxiety syndrome caused by coadministration of celecoxib, a selective <scp>COX</scp>‐2 inhibitor, with escitalopram and trazodone in a patient with depression and spondylolisthesis",
      "abstract": "Antidepressant-induced jitteriness/anxiety syndrome is characterized as anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, and (hypo)mania, which appear immediately after initiation or increased dosage of an antidepressant. This report describes a case of the jitteriness/anxiety syndrome caused by the coadministration of celecoxib with escitalopram and trazodone in a patient with depression and spondylolisthesis. The depression of a patient, a woman in her 60 s, had been in remission at least for 5 years under treatment using escitalopram and trazodone. Immediately after coadministration of celecoxib because of her buttock and limb pain, she showed anxiety, agitation, akathisia, insomnia, irritability, aggressiveness, impulsivity, and hypomania. These symptoms disappeared after the discontinuation of celecoxib. The present case suggests that coadministration of celecoxib with escitalopram and trazodone can cause the jitteriness/anxiety syndrome, presumably via a pharmacokinetic interaction of celecoxib with these antidepressants and/or the effects of celecoxib on serotonergic neurotransmission.",

      "abstract": "• Four patients had a characteristic motor paresis that was dramatically improved by sympathetic block. The cause of this paresis could not be determined by the usual neurological examinations. It was similar to reflex sympathetic dystrophy in that the patients experienced severe pain, swelling, coldness, and muscle atrophy in the affected limbs or other parts of the body in the course of their illness. However, the motor paresis could precede the pain or develop after the pain had disappeared. Even in the absence of pain, the motor paresis was exacerbated by sympathetic stimulation using epinephrine, norepinephrine (nor-adrenalin), or isoproterenol hydrochloride (Proternol) loading and was improved by regional intravenous infusion of reserpine or by sympathetic ganglion block. Loading with pilocarpine, atropine sulfate (Bosmin), and edrophonium chloride (Antirex) did not influence the paresis. This motor paresis is thought to be due to abnormally increased sympathetic tone and may be considered a motor form of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. However, motor paresis closely related to sympathetic dysfunction is quite a new condition that we call \"sympathetic motor paresis.\" This is important clinically because a long-standing effect can be expected from permanent sympathetic ganglion block with dehydrated ethanol.",

      "title": "Altered Level of Consciousness after Combined Spinal-Epidural Labor Analgesia with Intrathecal Fentanyl and Bupivacaine",
      "abstract": "Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology, Department of Anesthesiology, Northwestern University Medical School.Received from the Department of Anesthesiology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois.COMBINED spinal-epidural labor analgesia has become increasingly popular because of the rapid onset of profound analgesia accompanied by minimal motor blockade. 1The technique usually includes an intrathecal injection of opioid, often fentanyl or sufentanil, either alone or in combination with a local anesthetic. Reported side effects include pruritus, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, fetal bradycardia, and respiratory depression or, more rarely, respiratory arrest. 2Several authors have reported the occurrence of high sensory blockade 3,4associated with facial tingling, dysphagia, and dyspnea. Fragneto and Fisher 5recently reported a case of “mental status change and aphasia” after the intrathecal injection of 10 μg sufentanil and 2.5 mg isobaric bupivacaine. The author reports a case of mental status changes associated with automatisms and an inability to speak after intrathecal injection of 25 μg fentanyl in combination with 2.5 mg bupivacaine.A 27-yr-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, with full-term, singleton vertex gestation was admitted to the labor and delivery unit with painful uterine contractions. The patient's medical history and antenatal course were unremarkable. She had not received neuraxial analgesia with her previous deliveries. She denied use of alcohol or any illicit drugs. The obstetrician's examination revealed 4-cm cervical dilation, 80% effacement, +1 station and ruptured membranes. The patient requested epidural labor analgesia. She had not received any medications.The patient was placed in the sitting position, and combined spinal-epidural analgesia was initiated at the L3–L4 interspace via a needle through needle technique, using a 17-gauge epidural needle and a 27-gauge Whitacre spinal needle (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The intrathecal injection consisted of 25 μg fentanyl (fentanyl; Elkins-Sinn, Inc., Cherry Hill, NJ, USA; 50 μg/ml, 0.5-ml) in combination with 2.5 mg bupivacaine (Sensorcaine-MPF; Astra USA, Inc., Westborough, MA, USA; 0.5%, 0.5-ml). A single open end-hole epidural catheter was threaded approximately 4-cm into the epidural space and an epidural test dose (1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 [3-ml]) was administered. The test dose was considered negative on the basis of no change in heart rate, or development of dense spinal blockade. A continuous epidural infusion was initiated with a solution containing 0.06% bupivacaine and fentanyl, 2 μg/ml, at 15 ml/h. The patient's vital signs were monitored for approximately 15 min, during which time her blood pressure ranged from 145/85 to 105/55 mmHg. Minimal motor weakness of the lower extremities was present.Approximately 25 min after the patient received the intrathecal medications, the anesthesiologist was called. Upon arrival in the labor room, the anesthesiologist noted that the patient was not responsive to verbal stimuli, and was generally combative, swinging her arms wildly. Respiratory rate was 6 breaths/min and pulse oximetry revealed a hemoglobin oxygen saturation of 94% while breathing room air. Heart rate was 100 beats/min, blood pressure was 105/55 mmHg and the patient was moving her upper and lower extremities well. She was given oxygen, positive pressure ventilatory assistance via bag and mask, and 160 μg intravenous naloxone (naloxone HCl; Abbott Laboratories, N. Chicago, IL; 0.4 mg/ml) in divided doses. The epidural infusion was discontinued.Within 1–2 min, the patient's respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 100%. She was no longer combative, but she was not fully alert: She looked absently around the room, and did not speak, or attempt to mouth words, when questioned. She exhibited behaviors best described as automatisms, such as looking intently at her intravenous tubing and picking it up. Several minutes later, she communicated by nodding her head in response to yes/no questions, or squeezing the examiner's hand, but still did not speak. She had a sensory level to cold in the distribution of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. Over the next 15 min, the patient gradually recovered the ability to speak, although she was still not quite fully alert. It was noted that the patient scratched occasionally.Forty minutes after treatment with naloxone (65 min after the intrathecal medications had been given), while the anesthesiologist was still in the room, the patient suddenly began scratching her face and upper body quite severely and over the next minute she once again became less responsive and more combative. She was given an additional 80 μg intravenous naloxone and she once again became more alert, though not fully so. Again, she looked around the room, displayed automatisms, and did not speak. After several minutes she communicated through nonverbal methods and then gradually regained the ability to speak.Approximately 30 min after the second dose of naloxone (95 min after the intrathecal medications had been given), the patient was speaking fluently and complaining of labor pain. Obstetrical examination revealed complete cervical dilation and effacement and +2 station. She was delivered of a liveborn female infant shortly thereafter. One and 5 min APGAR (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration) scores were 9 and 9.One hour after delivery, the patient was awake, fully alert, and oriented to person, place, and time and was released from the labor and delivery unit by the anesthesiologist. She had incomplete recall of the events, including a vague recollection of being unable to speak.As combined spinal-epidural labor analgesia is used more commonly, several uncommon adverse reactions have been reported, including excessive sedation and severe respiratory depression. 2Sensory blockade that extends to the high thoracic dermatomes, or even the trigeminal dermatomes can occur because the opioid or local anesthetic intrathecal solutions commonly injected are hypobaric, and analgesia is often initiated with the patient in the sitting position. 3,4An English language literature search revealed no other reports of this type of reaction occurring after intrathecal fentanyl and bupivacaine.The time of onset of the event makes it likely that it was a reaction to the intrathecal medications. The sedation, respiratory depression, and pruritus are consistent with cephalad spread of fentanyl, and naloxone quickly reversed these symptoms. The patient required a second dose of naloxone for these symptoms after 40 min, which is consistent with its duration of action. The patient's other behaviors (decreased levels of alertness and attentiveness and automatisms accompanied by muteness) did not respond to treatment with naloxone. Perhaps a higher dose of naloxone would have reversed these symptoms also. It is possible that cephalad spread of bupivacaine played an undetermined role in this patient's presentation.Although the patient's test dose was negative, it is still possible that the epidural catheter was placed intravascularly. If this were the case the patient would have received approximately 12.5 μg fentanyl and 3.75 mg bupivacaine over approximately 25 min. While this dose is too small to entirely explain these symptoms, intravenous fentanyl-bupivacaine could have worsened the clinical situation. Opioid induced hypoventilation could also have worsened the patient's clinical course.The combination of decreased alertness and attentiveness, automatisms, and inability to speak are reminiscent of temporal lobe seizure activity, and it is possible that this patient's behaviors represented some sort of seizure, the mechanism of which is unclear. Unfortunately, there was no electroencephalogram documentation during or after the event.Fragneto and Fisher 5reported a case of combined spinal-epidural labor analgesia with 10 μg intrathecal sufentanil and 2.5 mg bupivacaine followed by mild respiratory acidosis and mental status changes including “aphasia” and “an apparent disassociated state,” symptoms very similar to those of our patient. They hypothesized that the reaction was caused by cephalad spread of either the opioid or the bupivacaine. They did not attempt to treat the patient with naloxone. A similar mechanism of action may have been present in both the case reported by Fragneto and Fisher and the case presented here.Although high sensory blockade is not uncommon after intrathecal fentanyl and bupivacaine are administered for labor analgesia, it is unlikely that sensory blockade of the larynx (recurrent and superior laryngeal branches of the tenth cranial nerve) could account for difficulty with speech. In cases where such sensory deficits are known to exist (for instance, during sensory blockade in preparation for conscious intubation), patients are able to speak. Thus, normal sensation is not necessary for speech production.It is not likely that the lidocaine and epinephrine epidural test dose was injected into the intrathecal or subdural space because the patient did not exhibit appreciable motor weakness and/or hypotension. In addition, it is unlikely that the patient had isolated motor weakness of the laryngeal nerves. She did not appear to mouth words, as if attempting to speak.In summary, the author presents a case of an altered level of consciousness and inability to speak after intrathecal fentanyl and bupivacaine administered for labor analgesia. Clinicians should be aware of this possible complication when this analgesic technique is used.The author thanks M-Marsel Mesulam, M.D., (Department of Neurology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois) for his help with preparing this manuscript.",

Dementia, psychoses, and emotional disorders, such as depression and anxiety/panic disorder, also impair behavior. Symptoms may be produced by dysfunction of the central nervous system, medication, and/or the psychosocial problems associated with Parkinson's disease. Treatment therefore should be based on the cause of the symptoms seen. In some cases, the reduction or change of antiparkinsonian drugs, or both, may be effective. Treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including motor fluctuations, may reduce the risk of panic attacks being evoked in the 'off' period. Use of antidepressants, sedatives, and neuroleptics may often be effective. Physicians should identify the causes of the symptoms of behavioral impairment and select appropriate treatments.",

      "abstract": "Immediately after the introduction of arsphenamine there was recognized a type of precocious neurosyphilis to which was given the name neurorecurrence (Neurorezidive). As usually accepted, this term is limited to a syndrome consisting of the sudden appearance of symptoms and signs of involvement of the central nervous system in a patient with early (primary or secondary) syphilis, who has received an amount of treatment insufficient to eradicate the infection, and has then lapsed from treatment. The clinical manifestations are varied, but usually consist of an acute or subacute syphilitic meningitis, commonly with, but sometimes without, focal lesions of the cranial nerves. The early literature on this subject was filled with a controversy as to whether these lesions were caused by the harmful effects of arsenicals or by syphilis. The controversy has long since been settled. Neurorecurrences are due, not to arsphenamine, but to too little arsphenamine; the symptoms usually disappear",

Simultaneous administration of clonazepam or dipropylacetate (the latter in a short term combination) with diphenylhydantoin can cause a significant increase of diphenylhydantoin serum concentrations and intoxications. The combination of carbamazepin with diphenylhydantoin can cause a decrease of diphenylhydantoin serum concentrations. The simultaneous administration of diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital can produce a significant increase of phenobarbital levels in the statistical average and in the case of a combination of primidon and diphenylhydantoin an intoxication by the primidon metabolite phenobarbital. These possible interactions which are not obvious at the beginning of therapy are supplemented by other factors as intercurrent diseases or erratic drug intake. With routine measurements of serum concentrations of anticonvulsive drugs some of these interfering factors can be eliminated by realizing them in time. Treatment becomes more effective and side effects are reduced. The development of a new check list for the treatment of epileptic patients should also improve the control and give better informations about the course of the disease.",

      "abstract": "The neuropsychiatric symptoms of old patients with disturbed cerebral metabolism or blood flow mostly lead to great individual difficulties and make those patients difficult to handle: in the family as well as in hospital such patients develop alienation, isolation and therefore adaptation to a social structure deteriorates with time. In the course of a test program for medicinal therapy of this syndrome we studied the efficacy of a vincamine containing formulation (Pervincamin forte retard or Pervincamin ampoules, respectively) on the symptoms of a chronical brain disturbance. The study was randomised double-blind. We found that under the influence of the vincamine formulation the subjective symptoms, such as lack of interest, apathy, aggressiveness, raging, psychomotoric retardation, lack of concentration, dysmnesia, decreased with a statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Also the subjective symptoms, reported by the patients, such as tinnitus and vertigo decreased significantly under the treatment with the vincamine preparation. Therefore some of the parameters important for resocialisation and revitalisation of old patients could be influenced in a favourable way. Basing on the good results of our investigations, the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in old patients with vincamine containing drugs seems to be justified.",

For instance, the patient who is agitated, hostile, and aggressive presumably responds best to chlorpromazine, while the more apathetic and withdrawn patient in need of energizing is said to respond better to one of the piperazine derivatives, such as fluphenazine or trifluoperazine. However, most controlled research until the recent past has been unable to verify these observations; nor has anyone demonstrated that different phenothiazines result in any different clinical effects of any kind, even though clear differences in side",

We wish to develop this idea to prove that eclampsia is a distinct disease, with a definite pathologic picture, that at times convulsions prove the constant feature, but not invariably so. We may have eclampsia with a typical picture without convulsions. In such cases the eclamptic seizure is manifested (1) by a headache of agonizing, blinding type, in which the patient may become unconscious from the pain; or (2) perhaps as a burning substernal pain, which is, in our experience, an almost constant feature",

      "title": "Temporomandibular joint dislocation due to atypical antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia: a case report",
      "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes sustained muscle contractions, repetitive twisting movements, and abnormal postures of the trunk, neck, face, arms or legs [Fahn et al. 1987]. It may be focal, segmental (multifocal), or generalized and may also be primary or secondary based on their etiology. It may manifest as oculogyric crisis, deviation of eyes in all directions, protrusion of tongue, trismus, lock jaw, torticolis, laryngeal spasm, difficulty in speaking, facial grimacing, opisthotonus, lordosis or scoliosis and tortipelvic crisis. Drug-induced dystonia are secondary dystonias which occur commonly with drugs with antidopaminergic effects such as antipsychotics and metoclopramide [Ropper and Samuels, 2009; Fadare and Owolabi, 2009]. They reportedly arise from a drug-induced alteration of dopaminergic–cholinergic balance in the nigrostriatum (i.e. basal ganglia). Most drugs produce dystonic reactions by nigrostriatal dopamine D2 receptor blockade, which leads to an excess of striatal cholinergic output. High-potency D2 receptor antagonists are most likely to produce an acute dystonic reaction [Marsden and Jenner, 1980]. Agents that balance dopamine blockade with muscarinic M1 receptor blockade, such as atypical antipsychotics, are less likely to cause dystonic reactions [Marsden and Jenner, 1980; Volkow et al. 1998]. The incidence of acute dystonic reactions varies according to individual susceptibility, drug identity and dose of the drug. Increased age may carry less risk for the development of dystonia because of diminished numbers of D2 receptors. It occurs commonly to young males who are naive to antidopaminergic drugs [Volkow et al. 1998].\r\n\r\nOromandibular dystonia is one of the focal dystonias, which can be presented as jaw clenching, jaw opening or jaw deviation and leads to impaired speech and swallowing [Eken et al. 2009]. At times, oromandibular dystonia is so severe that it can cause temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation. So far, few case reports have been published about TMJ dislocation due to antipsychotic medications [Ibrahim and Brooks, 1996]. Among antipsychotic-induced TMJ dislocation, case reports were mainly for high-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol [Eken et al. 2009; Ibrahim and Brooks, 1996; Zakariaei et al. 2012]. It has been proposed that drugs such as risperidone and amisulpride which block specific receptors of serotonin (the S-HT2 receptors) and dopamine (the D2 receptors) are less likely to cause these effects [Owens, 1994]. Therefore, the present paper reports a case of oromandibular dystonia with TMJ dislocation with atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and amisulpride.",

      "title": "The Paclitaxel Acute Pain Syndrome: Sensitization of Nociceptors as the Putative Mechanism",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Paclitaxel therapy often result in a unique subacute pain syndrome, commonly termed \"myalgia\" or \"arthralgia.\" The pathophysiology of this syndrome is unknown and has not been demonstrated to be associated with any structural alteration of muscles or joints. We hypothesized that this syndrome was caused by a neuropathic nerve injury from paclitaxel. Herein, we characterize the clinical characteristics of this syndrome using detailed patient interviews and consider the putative mechanism(s) for these symptoms. Methods: Oncology patients who were treated with paclitaxel and developed a subacute pain syndrome were questioned using a detailed structured interview. Data were tabulated descriptively. Results: Eighteen patients were interviewed. The symptoms (ie, pain) typically began 1–2 days after the infusion and lasted for a median of 4–5 days. Pain was most commonly located in the back, hips, shoulders, thighs, legs, and feet, with the most common descriptors used being \"aching\" or \"deep pain.\" Commonly used adjectives to describe the pain were radiating, shooting, aching, stabbing, and pulsating. Some patients described increased pain with weight bearing, walking, or tactile contact. When asked directly whether the pains appeared to be specifically localized to either joints or muscles, 15 of 18 patients denied localization. Discussion: Based on the nature and temporal occurrence of the paclitaxel acute pain syndrome symptoms, we infer that the paclitaxel acute pain syndrome occurs as a result of sensitization of nociceptors, their fibers, or the spinothalamic system. This proposed neurologic etiology of this pain may also explain the subsequent development in some patients of a symmetric length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy. The mechanism of this syndrome needs further study.",

      "title": "Some Considerations of the Tolerability of Ketamine for ECT Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Most anesthetic agents used for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have few intrinsic adverse effects. Ketamine, however, is well known to be associated with a variety of adverse effects including nausea, dizziness, and psychotomimetic phenomena. Over the past several decades, there have been numerous reports on the use of ketamine for ECT anesthesia, with varied assessments on how prominent these adverse effects are in the ECT situation. Ketamine has received a resurgence of interest as an ECT anesthetic of late owing to its established independent antidepressant effects and to theoretical reasons why it might lessen the cognitive adverse effects of ECT. In this case series, the author reviews the experience with 14 patients who had undergone ECT who were switched to ketamine as anesthetic from methohexital at the preference of the treating anesthesiologist. All 14 patients spontaneously reported a strong preference not to be given ketamine again due to bothersome adverse effects. The latter consisted of either vestibular-type symptoms (nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and vertigo) or psychotomimetic effects (dissociative phenomena). It is concluded that ketamine is not free of adverse effects when used as an ECT anesthetic. Electroconvulsive therapy clinicians should be vigilant about assessing for these effects when ketamine is used, and consideration should be given to using a benzodiazepine such as diazepam or midazolam at seizure termination when ketamine anesthesia is used to prevent bothersome adverse effects seen upon awakening.",

Neuropathic pain syndromes due to peripheral nervous system injury are commonly encountered in clinical practice and often adversely affect patients’ quality of life.

      "title": "Psychodynamic Aspects of Reserpine: Its Uses and Effects in Open Psychiatric Settings",
      "abstract": "1) Reserpine is a remarkable and useful drug. It has a definite place in psychiatry for the alleviation of selected symptoms. It is not in any sense a psychic “specific”. 2) The physiologic effects of this drug are relatively constant. The principal ones are a fall in blood pressure, a relative bradycardia, and in adequate dosage, a slowing of the patient's spontaneous activity; feelings of weakness, tiredness and of being held down. 3) There are other effects, which are predominantly psychological and it is felt that they have nothing to do with the physiological effects per se. They are the result of the way in which the physiological action fits into the patient's way of handling and expressing his conflict (i.e. defenses). When a patient does badly it is due to the way in which the physiological effects psychologically threaten the patient. A patient does well or badly depending on this, and we have seen enhanced anxiety as well as psychoses produced by both reserpine and chlorpromazine (8). 4) Because of the above, psychotherapeutic efforts are of the greatest importance, and when used, usually overshadow the effects of the drug. We feel that no patient is treated in a vacuum. Milieu and relationship is what counts most. The other factors, though important, are adjuvants. 5) A level of 10 to 40 mg./day will control most motor over-activity. Anxiety and most panics can be handled at between 2 and 10 mg./day. The average daily dose was 7 mg./day. The average length of treatment was 26 days. 6) Side effects are frequent, but are rapidly reversible. There were no serious or irreversible toxic effects. The drug is remarkably safe. 7) Reserpine is of about the same usefulness as chlorpromazine in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is quicker acting. Reserpine is safer. When the G.I. tract is irritated or the site of symptoms, chlorpromazine is preferable. Cardiac or cardiovascular symptomatology might indicate a preference for reserpine, especially when bradycardia is desirable. Neither is a “specific” curative agent. Both are useful for the symptomatic relief of selected symptoms. Both have their contra indications. Neither is an effective substitute for intimate human contact with the patient. Both should be used along with psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "As a highly differentiated physiological process, swallowing may be affected by a variety of confounding factors. Primarily described are swallowing disorders caused by mechanical anatomic changes (e. g., alteration of the cervical spine, goiter), surgery for head and neck tumors, thyroid abnormalities, and neuromuscular disorders. Age-related cerebral neurological and blood vessel-associated changes can also cause dysphagia (so-called presbyphagia) or worsen the condition.Medication-associated dysphagia is recognized far less frequently, not paid due attention, or accepted in silence; particularly in older patients. Furthermore, pharmacological interference of different medications is frequently inadequately considered, particularly in the case of polypharmacy.Initial treatment of medication-induced dysphagia includes a critical review of medication status, with the aim of reducing/discontinuing the causative medication by giving precise instructions regarding its administration; as well as antacid medication, diet, and professional oral stimulation or swallowing training.To date, medication-induced dysphagia has not occupied the focus of physicians and therapists. This is despite the fact that many active agents can have a negative effect on swallowing and medication-induced dysphagia caused by polypharmacy is not uncommon, particularly in old age. This article presents an overview of the different classes of drugs in terms of their direct or indirect negative effects on the swallowing function.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them.

The mean global prevalence of 2.7% is estimated for this chronic condition. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches are often required as treatments of the challenges associated with fibromyalgia. Flupirtine, a non-opioid drug, exhibits effective analgesia in a range of acute and persistent pain conditions, and evidence as treatment of fibromyalgia is considered. Activation of Kv7 potassium channels and agonism at gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A leading to indirect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism is responsible for the analgesic effects of flupirtine and appears to be involved in other symptoms associated with fibromyalgia. Patients with fibromyalgia reported improved control of their symptoms without significant adverse effects in an observational audit in clinical practice. This article presents evidence that flupirtine, or related drugs, is a therapeutic option for the treatment of fibromyalgia. The pharmacology of flupirtine and mechanisms of action involved provide a spectrum of effects that would not only control the chronic pain characteristic of fibromyalgia but many of the other symptoms. Thus, further investigation of the efficacy of flupirtine or related drugs exhibiting a similar pharmacology as a treatment of fibromyalgia would be of interest.",

Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "title": "Effects of ozone treatment on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a promising research area",
      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of chemotherapy (CT), which involves mainly platinum-derived drugs, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and proteasome inhibitors. The usual symptoms of CIPN are numbness and tingling, hypoesthesia or allodynia, pain, loss of strength, and alterations in proprioception or thermal sensitivity. CIPN can become chronic, persist for months or years after completing CT, and be associated with and worsen other symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fatigue. CIPN affects the ability to carry out activities of daily living and markedly reduces patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL).1,2 When CIPN occurs during treatment, it can lead to a decreased CT dose or even premature withdrawal, with a subsequent negative impact on cancer prognosis. Current status of CIPN: Unfortunately, prophylactic and therapeutic measures for managing CIPN are very limited in number and degree of effectiveness.1 Duloxetine is the only evidence-based treatment, but only for \"pain\" management, with a \"moderate degree\" of recommendation, given the \"modest magnitude of its benefit.1\" In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT), compared with the placebo group (0.34), duloxetine provided a pain reduction of 1.06 points on a 10-point scale (using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form \"average pain\"), which disappeared 1 week after stopping the treatment, and it is a treatment associated with potential side effects.3 Although multiple treatments are usually administered for the management of numbness and tingling secondary to CIPN (such as venlafaxine, oxcarbazepine, amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and several antioxidants), the Clinical Guideline of the American Society of Medical Oncology established that there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use outside of RCTs.1 Moreover, the development and evaluation of new strategies to mitigate and manage the chronic side effects of cancer treatments (CIPN included) was established as an area of urgent research by the American Society of Medical Oncology.4 The pathogenesis of CIPN is multifactorial, and different combinations of factors are likely predominant for different drugs. Alterations have been described in the following aspects: i) microtubule activity; ii) ion channel activity (Na, K, Ca, transient receptor potential channels); iii) DNA (with subsequent alterations and dysregulation of intracellular transcriptional and signaling pathways, particularly those associated with DNA repair and apoptosis); iv) mitochondrial functions and cellular metabolism (with a local increase in oxidative stress and scavenger alterations); v) local alterations in the immune system (with local processes of neuroinflammation and microischemia); and vi) myelin alterations and axonal degeneration.2,5 Ozone (O3) treatment (O3T): O3 is a highly reactive compound composed of three oxygen (O2) atoms with higher oxidizing power than O2, meaning that it can chemically react with different substances by adding an atom of oxygen (or removing electrons) to its molecular structure. Because its oxidizing properties produce lung toxicity, O3T must always be carried out to avoid airway exposure to O3.6 Medical O3 is produced from medical-grade O2 using certified medical O3 generators. Its clinical use is based on an O3/O2 mixture at different concentrations, where O2 continues to be the most frequent component of the mixture (95–99%), with only a small percentage of O3 (< 1–5%). Owing to its short half-life (approximately 25 minutes at 30°C), the O3/O2 gas mixture cannot be encapsulated or stored and must be produced and administered in situ. The two main routes of O3/O2 administration that induce systemic effects are autohemotherapy and rectal insufflation. Using any of those approaches, O3T can produce an indirect systemic effect by inducing an adaptive response of the tissue and organism. O3 does not bind to specific receptors, nor does it follow the usual principles of pharmacology: it does not circulate through the bloodstream, nor does it follow the processes of distribution, metabolism or elimination. At adequate concentrations and for administration, O3/O2 interacts with the mucosa of the colon and rectum (rectal route) or with blood components (intravenous route). This produces rapid, moderate, and \"controlled\" oxidative stress at the local level, especially through interactions with double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids, with the disappearance of O3 and the generation of O3 peroxides i) intracellularly, with further actions as second messengers, and ii) extracellularly, as alkenals (mainly 4-hydroxynonenal), which can reach distant tissues through the bloodstream. These second messengers can modulate the glutathione redox system and activate nuclear transcription factors such as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, which induces the transcription of antioxidant response elements and the subsequent increase in antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, at moderate O3 concentrations, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 can also induce a decrease in the activity of Nfkb (nuclear factor kappa B, with proinflammatory action), which is one of the immune pathways modulated by O3T and leads to anti-inflammatory action. Additionally, O3/O2 can induce the activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase metabolism in red blood cells (with a further increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and a shift to the right of the oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve) as well as nitric oxide liberation by the microvasculature, with potential improvements in oxygen delivery to tissues and blood flow, respectively.6 In this way, O3/O2 can facilitate local autoregulation of ischemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation, with potential beneficial effects on diseases mediated by factors such as chronic ischemic diseases or inflammatory diseases. In the same way, these potential effects of O3/O2 look promising against some of the mechanisms involved in the production of CIPN that we have mentioned above. Two reviews have described the potential mechanisms of action and potential role of O3T in CIPN.5,7 Additionally, the potential role of the gut microbiota in CIPN has also been suggested, which could offer another potential target for the mechanism of action of O3T. Experience in O3T of CIPN: Because of the limited therapeutic options available for CIPN, treatments are usually offered to patients based on their mechanisms of action or their usefulness in other similar conditions, even if they have not proven effective in CIPN. With the same approach, according to the mechanisms of action of O3/O2, our multidisciplinary chronic pain unit offers O3T for the management of patients when symptoms are refractory to usual treatments, do not have effective treatment, or conventional treatment is potentially associated with high morbidity. In our hospital, the compassionate use of the O3T approach was approved by the Health Care Ethics Committee (September 20, 2017). This decision was based on the 37th Article of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (Fortaleza 2013). Currently, in our center, O3T is prospectively evaluated with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Las Palmas (April 29, 2022), which is registered in the Spanish Clinical Studies Registry (REEC 0063-2022-OBS) and ClinicalTrials.org (NCT05417737). Therefore, our current experience with O3T in CIPN patients is focused on different symptoms associated with CIPN and is based on compassionate use in a limited number of patients, pending subsequent evaluation in RCTs. The next paragraphs describe our main preliminary findings using O3T in CIPN. (Further details are shown in Additional Table 1. https://links.lww.com/MGAR/A98) The first report8 assessed 11 different locations (four hands and seven feet) in a group of seven patients with chronic pain secondary to CIPN (median age of 49 years, range: 36–73 years). Before submission for compassionate O3T, patients' symptoms were under unsuccessful treatment for a median time of 12 months. Rectal O3T provided significant and clinically relevant pain relief. A decrease in pain was reported by 86% of the patients. According to the visual analog scale (VAS), the pain level significantly decreased at the end of O3T (VAS score from 7 to 4) and remained significantly reduced 3 months (VAS score: 5.5) and 6 months (VAS score: 6) after the end of O3T. This long-lasting effect of O3T in CIPN pain is consistent with the protracted effect described in the management of some radiation-induced toxicities.9 The initial magnitude of the effect on the VAS score (3 points on a 10-point scale) and duration of improvement (6 months) compared favorably with those described for duloxetine (a 1-point decrease in a 10-point scale that disappeared 1 week after the end of duloxetine treatment) (Figure 1).Figure 1: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): clinical changes at the end of O 3 T.Clinical details before O3T and at the end of O3T: i) Pain, assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS), from 0 (better) to 10 (worse); ii) Health status (EQ-VAS) included in the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire, from 0 (worse) to 100 (better); and iii) Grade of toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.5.0) scale of the National Cancer Institute of EEUU, from 0 (no toxicity) to 5 (death). P value of paired comparisons according to the exact (significance) Wilcoxon rank test. Box: Quartiles 1 and 3; O3T: ozone treatment; X: median value.The second report10 described 26 cancer survivors treated with rectal O3T because of persistent or refractory side effects of cancer treatment. The analysis of the subgroup of 15 patients with CIPN revealed statistically significant improvements in all five domains of the EQ-5D-5 L HRQOL questionnaire (developed by the EuroQol Group), which includes mobility, self-care capacity, ability to carry out activities of daily living, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The median value of the self-evaluation of health status (EQ-VAS) included in the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire (from 0 (worse) to 100 (better)) also significantly improved after O3T (from 50 to 75). Additionally, after O3T, there was a significant improvement in the grade of CIPN toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.5.0) scale of the National Cancer Institute of EEUU. This work revealed that O3T could improve CIPN toxicity, and patients positively evaluated the impact of O3T on their HRQOL (Figure 1). A final report in 202311 specifically evaluated the impact of O3T on anxiety and depression in 16 patients treated because of refractory symptoms of severe diseases, most of which were secondary to CIPN. In this work, after O3T, patients reported a significant improvement in i) the anxiety/depression dimension of the general EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire and ii) both subscales (anxiety and depression) of the focused Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Both subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were significantly i) correlated with the anxiety/depression dimension of the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire and ii) inversely correlated with self perceived health status. However, in this study, it was not possible to determine whether the improvement in anxiety and depression was a direct effect of O3T or if it was partially related to the improvement in physical symptoms reported by most of the patients. In the complementary management of these patients, O3T was planned by rectal insufflation, 40 sessions in 4 months. Initial pharmacological treatments were maintained during O3T and were further reduced or removed in many patients when clinically indicated. Rectal insufflation of O3/O2 was well tolerated. The main side effects of O3T were soft and transient meteorism and bowel bloating, as expected with this O3T approach. The mild side effects of the procedure were described in our different manuscripts and are consistent with large reviews.12 In these works, many patients receiving O3T also reported improvements in different symptoms associated with CIPN, such as numbness and tingling, and alterations in hand and foot proprioception, a sense of balance, thermal sensitivity, or desire and sexual potency. However, these are encouraging but unpublished data, and they are currently under evaluation. These reports evaluated patients with refractory symptoms of CIPN after many months (median more than 12 months) of conventional management and revealed relevant clinical improvement (in magnitude and duration) after 4 months of O3T. These findings are encouraging and merit further research in a clinical condition (CIPN) without established therapy, except for the described effect of duloxetine on painful CIPN. However, these preliminary studies have two notable limitations: they were non-RCTs and had small sample sizes. Therefore, the results must be evaluated with caution. Focused RCTs are needed to validate these preliminary results. Currently, our hospital is carrying out two related RCTs in patients with CIPN: i) one focused on \"pain\" (EU CT ID: 2024-518021-16-00, NCT04299893) and ii) another ongoing RCT focused on \"numbness and tingling\" (EU CT ID: 2024–517196–20–00 and NCT06706544). Additionally, a prospective study is evaluating the impact of O3T on HRQOL, anxiety, and depression in cancer and noncancer patients treated with symptomatic and compassionate intention (AEMPS/REEC: 0063-2022-OBS, NCT05417737) in our chronic pain unit. Multicenter collaboration could facilitate and accelerate these advances and further research. Conclusion: CIPN is a common side effect of CT, with a potentially high impact on the administration of CT and the HRQOL of patients. Except for the small benefit of duloxetine for pain related to CIPN, there are limited therapeutic options for the different symptoms associated with CIPN. Few preliminary reports suggest that O3T could offer clinically relevant improvements in different symptoms associated with CIPN. The magnitude and duration of these results merit further focused research. RCTs are ongoing.

Injectors are at risk of infections endocarditis, which carries risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs after rupture of a septic (mycotic) aneurysm. Heroine users can are also at risk for hemorrhagic stroke secondary to liver failure with deranged clotting and to heroin nephropathy with uremia or malignant hypertension. In some heroin users the drug it self is directly causal due to vasculitis, hypersensitivity and immunologic changes. Embolization of foreign material to brain due to mixed of heroine with quinine can cause cerebral embolism. AMPHETAMINE AND other psychostimulants: In abuser of amphetamine hemorrhagic stroke can occur, oral, intravenous, nasal, and inhalational routes of administration have been reported. Most were chronic user, but in several patients, stroke followed a first exposure. Some of amphetamine induced intracranial hemorrhages are secondary to acute hypertension, some to cerebral vacuities, and some to a combination of two.

      "title": "The Role of Perfluorocarbons in Mitigating Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract : Neurological injury [brain and cord] is always accompanied by tissue deprivation of glucose and oxygen (ischemia/hypoxia). Most of the damage seems to be mediated by mechanisms that follow the initial injury (secondary mechanisms). Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are one of the methods by which oxygen delivery to tissue can be achieved after injury. The rationale for PFCs in traumatic brain injury has been well established in animal studies and early phase 2 clinical trials. Currently three perfluorocarbons are available in the United States for testing, but none of these have been FDA approved and only for one of them Oxycyte has the process of application for FDA approval even been commenced. For the third generation perfluorocarbon (Oxycyte) a possible side effect that has emerged in humans is transient mild thrombocytopenia. It is uncertain at this time whether this side effect will prove to be a limiting factor, which may jeopardize the use of these compounds as a class, or just affect Oxycyte in particular following traumatic brain and spinal cord injury. Any agent that might exacerbate thrombocytopenia in intracranial hemorrhage into traumatic contusions is dangerous for obvious reasons. The purpose of this grant therefore is to cross compare the safety and efficacy of three perfluorocarbons namely Oxycyte, Perftec and Oxygent. We assessed these 3 PFC agents in two head injury models (1) new PENETRATING brain injury animal model (human gunshot wound to head) and (2) closed severe rat TBI Fluid Percussion Injury (human car crash) with a secondary Hypoxic insult. We measured how the PFCs alter the ability of the injured brain (1) to use glucose, oxygen and (2) lower cell death caused by injury, (3) effect on blood clotting. First, we did not find any evidence of impairment of blood clotting in rats with TBI after treatment with PFCs unlike in humans.",

      "abstract": "<h3>To the Editor.—</h3> The report of three cases of \"withdrawal psychosis\" following abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepine therapy (237:36, 1977) could be misleading because of the use of this unfortunate term. What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued. Drugs such as the benzodiazepines (or phenobarbital)",

      "abstract": "There is still no medication for fragile X syndrome (FXS) which acts directly on the genetic mechanisms or on the immediate result of the genetic defect. However, behavioral and cognitive manifestations can be approached from both the psychological/educational and pharmacological sides. Both approaches are not mutually exclusive but are complementary and synergic. There are currently potent drugs which can improve important symptoms of the FXS, behavioral disorders, hyperactivity, attention deficit, obsessive disorders and anxiety. Pharmacological treatment can be useful: CNS stimulants, clonidine, folic acid, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and atypical antipsychotics. Pharmacological treatment of epilepsy is needed whenever epilepsy occurs. There is no specific antiepileptic for FXS, so action must be taken with the most efficient antiepileptic according to the crisis type, evaluating tolerance and possible effects on behavior. Insomnia is also of interest in children with FXS. In this case the use of melatonin can be of great help.",

      "abstract": "To carry out a bibliographic review of articles indexed in MEDLINE over the past 20 years concerning the pharmacological treatment of agitation in head injury.Head injury may cause different behaviour changes, of which agitation is the most dramatic. The incidence of agitation after severe head injury varies from 11% to 50% depending on the study involved. This incidence is high enough to warrant specific management. Drug treatment has variable results. When there is imminent danger of harm to the patient himself or to others, or when aggressive behaviour makes medical management difficult, the benzodiazepines have been found useful. Antipsychotic drugs are only indicated in head injury when the agitation causes a clinical emergency, and in such a case the more potent drugs such as haloperidol are best, since they have less sedative effect. They are also effective when the clinical features are similar to those of classical schizophrenia. Antiepileptic drugs have been used successfully for treating agitation-aggressiveness, specially in paroxystic behaviour disorders. We also consider other treatments used for posttraumatic agitation.There is no general agreement amongst doctors as to the best treatment for posttraumatic agitation in head injury. However, with regard to certain characteristics of agitation different drugs may be recommended for treatment.",

Kleptomania patients are highly likely to suffer from comorbid psychiatric disorders, most notably mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, other impulse control disorders, and alcohol and other psychoactive substance abuse/dependence disorders. Clonazepam and alprazolam have been reported to produce partial success in treating kleptomania.

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "The spectrum of bent spine disorders\n\nHead ptosis (drop) results from weakness of the neck extensor, or increased tone of the flexor muscles. It is characterised by marked anterior curvature or angulation of the cervical spine and is associated with various neuromuscular (table 1) and extrapyramidal disorders.12–15 Camptocormia or the bent spine syndrome was first described in hysterical soldiers in 1915 by the French neurologist Souques.16 Typically there is marked anterior curvature of the thoracolumbar spine. In some patients the spine is angulated forward, the arms propped against the thigh for support. More cases, all among soldiers, were reported during the first and second world wars. These patients responded well to psychotherapy. Recently camptocormia arising as a result of weakness or abnormality in the tone of the paraspinal muscles has been described (table 2). In contrast with other skeletal disorders of the spine such as kyphosis, the deformity in head ptosis and camptocormia is not fixed and is corrected by passive extension or lying in the supine position. It is not possible to straighten the neck or back voluntarily. The evaluation of these disorders can indeed be challenging and often no definite diagnosis is made, as illustrated by four cases of head ptosis and camptocormia seen by us at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nView this table:\n\n Table 1 \nNeuromuscular causes for head ptosis\n\n\n\nView this table:\n\n Table 2 \nCauses of camptocormia\n\n\n\nAn 80 year old man developed head ptosis insidiously over a period of few weeks.

      "abstract": "The history, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of phencyclidine hydrochloride (PCP) intoxication, the pharmacology of PCP and the detection, identification and analysis of PCP are reviewed. The history of PCP from its synthesis in the early 1950s to the present is discussed. Intoxication with low to moderate doses of PCP resembles an acute, confusing state. High doses may cause serious neurological and cardiovascular complications and the patient is often comatose for several days. Treatment involves supportive psychological and medical measures, and acidification of the urine may further increase PCP clearance. The metabolism of PCP involves primarily hydroxylation followed by conjugation and elimination in the urine. Analysis can be accomplished by a number of instrumental methods, and several commercial test kits based on antigen-antibody interactions are available. PCP's effect on human performance and behaviour is due to its ability to alter the perception of reality in the user. PCP causes a range of effects that include hallucinations, delirium, disorientation, agitation, muscle rigidity, ataxia, nystagmus, seizures, and stupor. PCP has stimulant, depressant, hallucinogenic and analgesic effects. Which of these will be most pronounced is unpredictable and depends on the user's personality, psychological state and the environment of use. The impairment can manifest itself as over-aggressive or reckless driving behavior, or may mimic depressant effects due to PCP's anesthetic and depressant effect.",

      "title": "[Therapeutic strategies in epilepsy].",
      "abstract": "With the advances in the so-called classic antiepileptic drugs (AED)--carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproate--monotherapy has become the most popular strategy for the treatment of epilepsies, based on their unquestionable clinical efficacy and on frequent drug interactions and teratogenesis caused by polypharmacy. The choice of an AED should be ruled by its efficacy against a given seizure type; by its toxicity, either acute, dose-related or idiosyncratic, or chronic, due to the length of therapy or AED dosage; by its capacity to interact with other drugs, either AEDs or not, mainly through pharmacokinetic interactions, leading to fluctuation in the plasma concentration of the target drug and hence decreased in their efficacy; by its potential cognitive and behavioural side effects; by its teratogenesis which is common to all AEDs; by its cost. Despite their efficacy, about 35% of the patients are inadequately treated with monotherapy, partial, symptomatic or associated to encephalopathy being the most frequent of their seizures. For this particular group, the association of two AEDs could play an important role. The increasing knowledge of the mechanisms of the new generation of AEDs, such as vigabatrin and lamotrigine, and their favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, rise to the new concept of rational polytherapy which allows an additive or supra-additive therapeutic efficacy, a limited toxicity, a decrease in drug interactions and an increased compliance. Although monotherapy should continue to be the choice therapy for epilepsies, this concept could be a reasonable and early option in the treatment of some refractory epilepsies.",

      "title": "A Rare Cause of a Treatable Abnormal Movement, Not to Miss",
      "abstract": "Parkinsonism is a syndrome composed of tremor at rest, bradykinesia, rigidity, loss of postural reflexes, flexed posture, and freezing.1 There are various acquired etiologies causing parkinsonism, such as dopaminergic blocking agents, cerebrovascular diseases, brain neoplasm, the intoxication of various toxins, brain trauma, and metabolic disturbances. Abnormal calcium metabolism causing hypo- or hypercalcemia can lead to adverse effects of the human nervous system. Although neurological manifestations of hypercalcemia mainly present as an alteration of consciousness or depression, the manifestations of hypocalcemia range from muscle twitching, spasms, tetanic contraction, numbness, altered mental status, encephalopathy, and seizures.2, 3 Movement disorders, such as chorea and parkinsonism, are unusual complications of hypocalcemia. Herein, we report a case of hypocalcemia attributed to post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism that presented with acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation. Those symptoms were dramatically improved after correcting hypocalcemia. A 74-year-old Thai woman had been diagnosed with hypertension for 7 years. She had been taking enalapril 5 mg/day and propranolol 10 mg/day. She had had a thyroidectomy 30 years ago due to a large goiter. For 3 days, she was hospitalized because of a severe, disabling right-hand tremor and psychomotor retardation. She had a history of diarrhea and vomiting 4 to 5 times/day without fever for 5 days. Neurological examination demonstrated several parkinsonian features, including a masked face; chin tremor; and resting, postural, and intention tremors at the right upper extremity. Bradykinesia presented in both the upper and lower extremities bilaterally (Video 1, segment 1). She also developed severe psychomotor retardation and attention deficit. Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs were negative. In segment 1 (pretreatment), physical examination revealed signs of parkinsonism, including masked face, chin tremor, resting, postural, and intention tremor approximately 3 to 4 Hz at the right upper extremities. Bradykinesia presented both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Wide-based gait and decreased arm swing on both sides predominantly on the right were observed. In segment 2 (posttreatment), after 4 days of calcium supplementation, parkinsonian symptoms and psychomotor retardation were markedly improved. In segment 3 (posttreatment), after 8 months of proper calcium supplementations, parkinsonian symptoms have not recurred. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13540 Routine blood chemistry showed acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen of 36.4 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.22 mg/dL, baseline creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL) with severe hypocalcemia (4.4 g/dL; normal range, 8.8–10.2 mg/dL), normal serum albumin (4.3 g/dL), hyperphosphatemia (7.8 mg/dL; normal range, 2.5–4.5 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (1.0 mg/dL; normal range, 1.6–2.6 mg/dL), a low 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (21.4 ng/mL; normal range, ≥ 30 ng/mL), and a low parathyroid hormone level (8.13 pg/mL; normal range, 15–65 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram showed a prolonged QT interval. Axial T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence of the brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse patchy confluence over the bilateral periventricular white matter without evidence of acute ischemic stroke by diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient, and brain computer tomography showed calcification at the bilateral globus pallidus (Fig. 1). Lumbar puncture was performed. The result was normal, including a negative viral meningoencephalitis panel. Hypocalcemia was corrected by intravenous calcium gluconate, and plasma calcium level was monitored closely. After 4 days of treatment, plasma calcium returned to the normal level concomitant with a remarkable improvement of both the parkinsonism and psychomotor speed (Video 1, segment 2). The patient was discharged from the hospital 7 days after admission. Calcium and vitamin D supplements were prescribed without dopaminergic medication. 18F-fluorodopa and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were performed. The results showed no evidence of abnormal presynaptic dopamine deficit and no hypometabolic pattern compatible with neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes (Fig. 1). At 8 months after taking calcium and vitamin D, the parkinsonism had vanished and never recurred (Video 1, segment 3). We report a case of acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation attributed to hypocalcemia, which was a complication of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. Parkinsonism in patients with hypocalcemia is rare. Its frequency increases in chronic hypocalcemia (Video 2). Full video from the 2021 Video Challenge discussion of this case. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13540 The neurological manifestations of hypocalcemia can occur in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). In the PNS, signs and symptoms of neuromuscular hyper-excitability including muscle twitching, tetanic contraction, trismus, and opisthotonos can be observed. The manifestations in CNS include encephalopathy, seizures, and, rarely, movement disorders.3-5 Hypocalcemia can result from hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.6 Early evidence of the association between parkinsonism and hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism was reviewed by McKinney.5 He reviewed cases of hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia with symptoms other than tetany between 1950 and 1960, finding that 3 of 90 patients had presented with parkinsonism. He also found calcification of the basal ganglion did not correlate with the presentation of abnormal movements.5 Subsequently, Abe and colleagues reported a summary of published cases of hypocalcemia attributed to hypoparathyroidism presenting with movement disorders.6 They found 31 reported cases in the literature published between 1965 to 1994.6 Of those, 18 cases presented with parkinsonism including their own cases.6 We have summarized the reports of parkinsonism associated with hypocalcemia to date in Table 1.7-11 Mood: improved Parkinsonism: persisted Brain imaging of hypocalcemia frequently showed basal ganglia calcifications, especially in chronic hypoparathyroidism.2 Precipitation of calcium-phosphorus hydroxyapatite crystals in the basal ganglia and cerebellum of patients with hypoparathyroidism has been proposed as the possible pathogenesis for developing movement disorders in patients with hypoparathyroidism.10 However, this hypothesis cannot explain why some patients with hypoparathyroidism develop movement disorders despite the absence of basal ganglia calcification. Our patient had experienced acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation attributed to hypocalcemia caused by hypoparathyroidism. Despite its rarity, hypocalcemia could be a treatable cause of acute parkinsonism. Physicians should be aware of this condition, and it should not be missed. Early recognition and prompt treatment provides excellent clinical outcomes. 1. Research project: A. Conception, B. Organization, C. Execution; 2. Statistical Analysis: A. Design, B. Execution, C.

      "abstract": "Epilepsy occurs in humans and animals. It is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide, but with the availability of modern diagnostic tools and therapeutic measures the outcome has been increasingly improved during the last years. Disregarding these achievements, about one third of the epilepsies remains refractory to treatment and requires special attention of treating epileptologists and basic scientists. Refractory epilepsy is associated with a high prevalence of complications such as sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, poor adherence, cognitive decline, long-term side effects, and a poor outcome. In case of refractory epilepsy, alternative therapies to antiepileptic drugs should be considered which include ketogenic diet, hypothermia, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, propofol, ketamine, inhalative anesthetics, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, or epilepsy surgery. Particularly status epilepticus, which may be convulsive or nonconvulsive, requires aggressive emergency treatment. With the invention and approval of new therapeutic agents, it should be possible to further narrow the segment of intractable epilepsies, not only in human but also in veterinary patients. Experimental and spontaneous animal models are used to find clinically useful therapies for symptomatic management of epilepsies and to understand the basic pathomechanism of novel forms of epilepsies.",

Intravascular toxicity is correlated with intrinsic anesthetic potency, whereas toxicity following extravascular injections is a function of physiological disposition characteristics of the various agents, such as rate of vascular absorption, rate of tissue redistribution, and rate of metabolism. The central nervous system is most susceptible to the toxic effects of local anesthetic agents. Signs and symptoms of CNS excitation followed by depression are the most common manifestations of local anesthetic toxicity. Cardiovascular depression may also occur following administration of excessive doses of local anesthetic agents or following high spinal or epidural anesthesia.",

      "abstract": "Severe epileptic encephalopathy in previously healthy school-aged children has been reported in literature under various names and the name febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is proposed. A brief febrile episode is followed by an acute phase characterized by recurrent focal seizures that evolve into drug-resistant status epilepticus. Finally, patients enter a chronic phase consisting of drug-resistant epilepsy and cognitive impairment. The etiology of this syndrome is still unknown and inflammatory, genetic, metabolic and autoimmune mechanism has been hypothesized. The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds once most other causes have been excluded. There is currently no specific therapy for FIRES. Seizures do not respond well to high doses of conventional anti-convulsant medications. Burst suppression coma, ketogenic diet and immunoglobulins are used in therapy, although their efficacy has not been proved. The outcome of FIRES is bad and only a minority survive the episode without any permanent neuro-psychological impairment. Dravet syndrome, epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutation of the protocadherin gene PCDH19 and idiopathic hemiconvulsion hemiplegia and epilepsy (IHHE) are epileptic encephalopathies which share similarities with FIRES.",

The first patient had also used cocaine, cannabis and alcohol, while the second patient had only used the hallucinogenic mushrooms. Both patients were treated symptomatically and survived despite their severe stab wounds. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used as mind-altering drugs. These drugs may sometimes induce 'bad trips', a psychotic reaction accompanied by fear, panic, and dangerous behaviour, especially when used in combination with other drugs and alcohol or by psychiatrically unstable patients. During a bad trip, patients may hurt themselves. Because the duration of the psychotic and sympathicomimetic effects of psilocybin after ingestion of mushrooms is short (up to 6 h), and since psilocin itself causes no permanent organ toxicity, the treatment of psilocybin intoxication is only symptomatic. The diagnosis ofpsilocybin intoxication is hampered by the lack of routinely available, rapid and sensitive, analytical methods for the quantification ofpsilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin.",

Alternatively, the frail ill may only require minuscule doses of a medicine such as a tricyclic antidepressant to achieve a therapeutic response. Firm pharmacological guidelines are inappropriate in this patient population. Patient acceptance of the need for medication and even the colour and size of the tablets can obliterate the placebo effect or contribute to non-pharmacological adverse effects.

      "abstract": "textabstractThe term migraine stems from hemicrania, describing a periodic disorder consisting of\nparoxysmal unilateral headache, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia and/or\nphonophobia. Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8). These results show\nthat migraine patients world-wide are still not receiving adequate treatment and a significant\nunmet need in migraine care still remains.",

      "title": "Do Negative Symptoms Respond to Pharmacological Treatment?",
      "abstract": "The introduction of neuroleptic (or anti-psychotic) medication into clinical practice was a major advance in the treatment of schizophrenia. Numerous well-controlled, double-blind clinical trials have established the therapeutic efficacy of these agents in both the acute and long-term treatment of schizophrenia (Klein et al , 1980; Kane &amp; Lieberman, 1987). In general, the therapeutic benefit of medication has been assessed in terms of the relative reduction in the more florid signs and symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, agitation, and hostility) and the ability of maintenance medication to reduce the rate of recurrence of these symptoms and in turn rates of rehospitalisation. At the same time it has been quite apparent that anti-psychotic drugs do not necessarily eliminate some of the major chronic disabilities of patients with this illness, disabilities reflected in impoverished affect, lack of drive and ambition, impaired spontaneity, reduced ability to relate to others, and diminished pleasure capacity. These symptoms have at times been described as negative in that they reflect an absence of or reduction in certain aspects of psychologic, cognitive, and emotional functioning in an attempt to distinguish them from the distortions or exaggerations in normal function which characterise positive symptoms (Strauss &amp; Carpenter, 1974; Jackson, 1904).",

Both patients were trialed on typical first-line treatments to address pica symptoms, including antidepressants, psychotherapy, and neurology consults, which were ineffective in treating pica symptoms.

      "abstract": "Clozapine (Clozaril®, Sandoz, East Hanover, NJ), an atypical antipsychotic agent with pharmacological properties considerably different from standard neuroleptics, has been found to be of great benefit especially to patients with treatment-resistant psychotic disorders. However, it is these unique pharmacological properties that have also been associated with mul tiple side effects ranging from the relatively benign (ie, sialorrhea during sleep, dizziness) to the potentially fatal (ie, agranulocytosis, seizures, and respiratory depression) which have limited its use. These untoward side effects are particularly problematic in the elderly population who often have concomitant medi cal illnesses requiring multiple medication regimens, including psychotropics that may interact with cloza pine (ie, benzodiazepines, cimetidine, fluoxetine). Because even the most benign of side effects has the potential of becoming fatal in certain circumstances if left unaddressed, it is imperative for patients, clinicians, pharmacists, and all health care professionals to be aware of adverse reactions and possible complica tions of clozapine therapy to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

      "abstract": "Calf cramps are sudden, involuntary, painful contractions of part of or the entire calf muscle that are visible, persist for seconds to minutes and then spontaneously resolve. They can occur with no identifiable cause, and are then referred to as common calf cramps. They may also be symptoms associated with diseases of the peripheral and central nervous system and muscle diseases. They also occur in association with metabolic disorders. In such cases the cramps are more extensive, intense and persist for longer. Cramp-fasciculation-myalgia syndrome additionally involves paresthesias and other signs of hyperexcitability of peripheral nerves. The recommended treatment for patients with frequent calf cramps causing significant impairment of well-being is oral administration of quinidine and/or botulinum toxin treatment of the calf muscles. During pregnancy both products are contraindicated, while probatory administration of magnesium is indicated.",

The most important one is akinesia, which includes decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, slowness of movement, awkwardness and freezing. On the other hand, an electrical focal lesion in the brain, neurotoxin to dopaminergic neurons such as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or I-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), cholinomimetic tremorogenic agents such as oxotremorine or tremorine, monoamine depleting agents such as reserpine or tetrabenazine, or dopamine receptor antagonists such as haloperidol are applied to render animal parkinsonism. The estimation of locomotor activity can be done accurately in animal models. Tremor can be studied using the animals treated by cerebral focal lesion, neurotoxins or cholinomimetics. Skillfulness is hard to estimate in animals, however, it can be done in primates. Freezing appeared in patients with levodopa treatment over a long period. This is a specific motor sign in Parkinson's disease, and cannot be observed in animals. Supplementing dopamine by levodopa administration, retarding the metabolism of levodopa or dopamine by dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor type B (MAO-B) inhibitor or catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, dopamine receptor agonists, anticholinergic agents, dopamine release enhancer/ uptake inhibitor, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, adenosine receptor antagonists, neurotrophic factors, GM1-ganglioside and nicotinic receptor agonists have been applied in the treatment of Parkinson's disease or are under investigation for patients.

To administer this drug with its severe potential side effects without a malaria diagnosis and without taking a patient’s mental health history is not medically justified.

      "title": "ACUTE DYSKINESIAS AFTER METOCLOPRAMIDE WITHDRAWAL",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Drug-induced movement disorders are usually caused by neuroleptics, although, at times, other drugs have been implicated. The pathophysiological mechanism is not yet clear, but imbalance between cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitters is believed to cause dystonic reactions. Metoclopramide hydrochloride is a benzamide drug, a selective D2 dopamine antagonist, and is equal in potency to clorpromazine in dopamine receptor blocking affinity. It can induce extrapiramidal movement syndromes with an incidence of 25 to 31%,1, 2 28.6/million prescriptions,3 and is found predominantly in younger patients (aged 12–19).3 We report a patient who developed acute extrapyramidal symptoms after sudden withdrawal of metoclopramide. Though extrapyramidal adverse effects of metoclopramide are well recognized, we have not found another case in the literature with acute presentation after metoclopramide withdrawal. An 82-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with congestive heart failure, no other chronic illnesses, and no family or personal history for movement disorder. He had been taking metoclopramide 10 mg three times per day orally (30 mg/d) for 3 years for esophageal regurgitation. Metoclopramide was discontinued, and 10 hours later the patient developed brief and repetitive episodes of facial grimacing, protrusion of the tongue, and neck contraction. Biperiden was administered intravenously, and no improvement was observed. The dyskinetic reaction disappeared spontaneously 10 hours after the onset. The patient was on no other medications capable of producing extrapyramidal side effects and had no family history of distonia. A brain CT was carried out, and there were no pathological findings. Metoclopramide hydrochloride is a neuroleptic dopamine receptor antagonist used widely in many patients with gastroparesis, esophageal reflux, and chemotherapy-induced nausea since its introduction in 1967 (1979 in the US). It produces behavioral and biochemical signs of receptor hypersensitivity.4 This drug is known to be accompanied by numerous reports of extrapyramidal side effects or movement disorders (dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesias, trismus, parkinsonism, rigidity, tremor).1, 5 The episodes of this patient were interpreted as acute dyskinesias similar to tardive dyskinesias (movements in the face with facial grimacing, tongue protusions, lip smacking, chewing movements), but these episodes were not caused directly by the neuroleptic treatment. Although the supression of other neuroleptics can induce movement disorders, it has not been reported previously with metoclopramide. In the Bateman study3 of 479 patients and in Miller's study2 of 1031 patients with extrapiramidal reactions to metoclopramide, there was no any acute extrapyramidal disorder secondary to metoclopramide withdrawal. The possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the increased dopaminergic activity in extrapyramidal structures subsequent to sudden release of dopaminergic receptors. The case is important not only because of the extrapyramidal effects that must be considered but also because of the possible effects of sudden metoclopramide withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Currently, approaches to pain control in horses are a mixture of art and science. Recognition of overt pain behaviours, such as rolling, kicking at the abdomen, flank watching, lameness or blepharospasm, may be obvious; subtle signs of pain can include changes in facial expression or head position, location in the stall and response to palpation or human interaction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. phenylbutazone, flunixin meglumine and firocoxib), opioids (i.e. butorphanol, morphine and buprenorphine) and α2 -adrenergic agonists (i.e. xylazine, detomidine, romifidine and medetomidine) are the most commonly used therapeutic options. Multimodal therapy using constant-rate infusions of lidocaine, ketamine and/or butorphanol has gained popularity for severe pain in hospitalised cases. Drugs targeting neuropathic pain, such as gabapentin, are increasingly used for conditions such as laminitis. Optimal strategies for management of pain are based upon severity and chronicity, including special considerations for use of intra-articular or epidural delivery and therapy in foals. Strategies that aim to mitigate adverse effects associated with use of various analgesic agents are briefly discussed.",

      "title": "Hypnodiagnostic and Hypnotherapeutic Fantasy-Evocation and Acting-out Techniques",
      "abstract": "Abstract During the past five years, we have been experimenting with a number of hypnotic techniques with which to reach patients who have little or no motivation, at least at first, for psychotherapy. For the most part, these techniques have been utilized with patients with real or apparent medical or surgical disease, who had been, so far as can be judged, medically or surgically sick for five, ten or more years. The more usual interviewing techniques frequently could give us no clues, even so far as differential diagnosis (of organic from emotional disease) was concerned. As a result, techniques were devised whereby these patients were hypnotized, sometimes without their knowledge or conscious consent, but nevertheless always with their consent implied, without at any time using the word “sleep” or suggesting eye-closure, so that, by the use of other techniques still under investigation, symptoms could be precipitated or intensified even to the point of having asthmatic or epileptic attacks reproduced, for instance, during the consultation session. By still other techniques, symptom-formation was then blocked and the inevitable, resultant anxiety reaction repressed, so that underlying fantasies could erupt into conscious awareness even to the point of being acted out. An asthmatic patient, for example, when his asthmatic attack was blocked, acted out the killing of his girl friend by knocking her to the floor and jumping over and over again on her abdomen. An adolescent, with what was thought to be probable extra-pyramidal disease, began to masturbate. Examples could be multiplied almost ad inftnitum In all cases, symptoms served more than one function, and several such functions would be acted out either concurrently or one after the other. Such reactions have been utilized for the purpose of differential diagnosis, but not in the more usual sense of the term. We cannot, for instance, say that these patients do not have asthma, epilepsy, etc. By means of these techniques, however, we have found it possible to determine, and to determine rapidly, the neurotic or psychotic functions which their symptoms serve, and, in addition, to state further that, irrespective of whether or not it be asthma, epilepsy, etc., specific patients with these diagnoses can be helped and even “cured,” after having been taken partly or completely off medication, by psychiatric treatment. This can proceed in two different ways: (a) With patients who are poorly motivated toward treatment, substitute symptoms may be set up, provided they serve the same neurotic needs, or other specifically hypnotherapeutic techniques utilized. (b) Patients who can come into a good therapeutic relationship, sometimes as a result of the hypnodiagnostic procedures listed above, can then be treated both (1) by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques, either on non-hypnotic or hypnotic levels, and, in addition, (2) by techniques made possible only by the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. Some of these, again, are acting-out techniques. There is little in the whole field of hypnotherapy that is not controversial. This applies even to a definition of hypnosis. However, from the angle of approach of the material presented in this chapter, we tentatively incline to believe that whatever else, in addition, the hypnotic interpersonal relationship is, it seems to be a fantasy-evoking one in which the patient, on the basis of his own experiential background and with more ready access to his pre-conscious, thinks, feels, experiences, reacts and even acts-out exactly as he believes the hypnotist wishes him to, projecting his own impulses, desires and fantasies to the therapist. Or—and this is of course the same thing—his reaction may negativistically be the very opposite of this. For this reason, when techniques of this type are utilized, no direct suggestion at any time is given the patient. When treatment of this type is decided upon, calculated risks must at times be taken. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting-out by the patient of the fantasies of the therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided.",

      "title": "Intravenous Regional Phenoxybenzamine in the Treatment of Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy ",
      "abstract": "(Malik, Mustafa, Pimentel) Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology.(Inchiosa) Professor of Pharmacology, Research Professor of Anesthesiology.(Sanapati) Fellow in Anesthesiology.(Frost) Professor and Chair of Anesthesiology.REFLEX sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a disabling pain disorder that may develop as a consequence of trauma or surgery affecting the limbs. [1]In the revised taxonomic system, the disorders RSD and causalgia are grouped under the umbrella term, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). [2]The syndrome of RSD includes manifestations such as severe burning pain, hyperpathia, allodynia, hyperhidrosis, edema, vasomotor instability, and characteristic demineralization of the bone. [3]The pathologic mechanism in RSD is not known, and various treatment modalities, including vasodilators, radiotherapy, acupuncture, steroids, and nerve stimulation techniques, have been used. [4]Local anesthetic blockade of sympathetic ganglia or blocking the same fibers with other types of nerve blocks, including epidural block, [4,5]is commonly applied in the management of RSD. Sympatholytic drugs have been used to provide a sympathetic block that is more prolonged than that achieved by local anesthetic alone. Intravenous regional blockade with a local anesthetic combined with guanethidine, reserpine, or steroids [4,6–9]has been used in an attempt to provide prolonged sympathetic blockade. Oral alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, including phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, and terazosin, have been used with varying degrees of success. [10,11]The present series of treatments was designed to test the efficacy and safety of intravenous regional blockade with phenoxybenzamine in patients with RSD. The rationale for the use of phenoxybenzamine was related to its noncompetitive, irreversible blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors. It was considered that a long-lasting sympathetic blockade might decrease or eliminate the sensitization that characterizes the syndrome. The evaluation of treatment efficacy was made by assessment of pain relief, skin temperature changes, and hand grip strength. We present the results for the first five patients treated with a formulation consisting of a mixture of phenoxybenzamine and lidocaine.* The study population consisted of patients demonstrating allodynia, hyperalgesia or hyperesthesia, and vasomotor disturbances in the extremity consistent with the clinical picture of RSD. The study was approved by the New York Medical College Institutional Review Board, and informed written consent was obtained from all participants. Demographic and clinical histories of the patients are presented in Table 1.Patients were instructed before treatment on the use of a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0–10) for rating the intensity of pain. They were asked to consider the most intense degree of pain that they had experienced during their illness as a score of 10; and 0 represented absence of pain.After establishing intravenous access in the unaffected limb, an intravenous cannula also was inserted and secured in the affected extremity. The affected extremity was elevated for 3 min and was further exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage. A double-cuff tourniquet was placed proximally on the extremity. The tourniquet was inflated 100 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure of the arm, but did not exceed 300 mmHg. Thirty milliliters of solution was used for intravenous regional blockade of an upper extremity; this solution consisted of 15 ml of 0.5% lidocaine HCl, 5 mg of phenoxybenzamine HCl (SmithKline-Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA), 0.05 ml of absolute alcohol, 0.05 ml of propylene glycol, 0.0005 ml of hydrochloric acid, and isotonic saline to make up the final volume. Ultraviolet spectrophotometric analyses of the formulation demonstrated that there were no physical or chemical incompatibilities of the two drugs in the final solution; the mixture appears to be stable at room temperature indefinitely. The data for these analyses are part of our Food and Drug Administration IND application.The total volume of study drug and lidocaine (30 ml) was administered over 4 min. Distribution of the drug was hastened by brief periods of active or passive movements of the extremity. After a minimum period of 15 min, the tourniquet was deflated; it was then reinflated, and the patient was observed for possible drug side effects. It was then fully deflated. Monitoring of blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiogram was performed continuously from 10 min before the procedure to 2 h after release of the tourniquet. The recordings 10 min before the procedure were considered as baseline values. The patients' intensities of pain using a VAS scale were recorded before and at 30, 60, 90, and 360 min after treatment; the 360-min record represented a score assigned by the patient at home approximately 6 h after the procedure. The patients were also asked to record VAS scores at home twice daily at approximately 12-h intervals for a period of at least 1 week. Daily follow-up calls were made to patients at home for 1 week. Skin surface temperature of the affected and unaffected extremity was measured before and at 30, 60, and 90 min after treatment; measurements were repeated at an early follow-up visit to the hospital, which ranged from 6 to 27 days after the procedure. The temperature measurements were made with skin tapes, graduated in 0.25 [degree sign] Celsius, and applied to the dorsal surface of the hand. The measurements in the untreated hand served as a control for possible differences in environmental temperature at the various times of measurement, and for possible systemic effects of phenoxybenzamine after release of the tourniquet. Patients were evaluated for hand grip strength of the affected and unaffected extremity before and at 30, 60, and 90 min after treatment and at the early follow-up hospital visit; a hand dynamometer was used for these measurements. Long-term follow-up evaluation of VAS score was obtained either by personal or telephone interview, ranging from 7 to 17 months after the procedure.Baseline and post-procedure VAS scores for each patient are presented in Figure 1. There were similar profiles in the pain scores among the subjects in the days after the treatment, with complete or nearly complete termination of pain after 1 week. Pain was still absent at short-term and long-term follow-up evaluations. All subjects showed an increase in skin surface temperature of the treated extremity at 90 min after procedure (Table 2), but the differences were not statistically significant at early follow-up evaluation. Skin temperature showed no pattern of change in the untreated extremity (Table 2).Hand grip strength of the treated extremity showed a progressive trend toward improvement after intravenous regional blockade that continued to the early follow-up evaluation (Table 3); the untreated extremity did not show any changes in strength.There were no hemodynamic changes after removal of the tourniquet, in any patient, that required intervention.The regional intravenous administration of phenoxybenzamine for the treatment of RSD does not appear to have been evaluated previously. A search of the literature revealed only one reference to the regional administration of phenoxybenzamine. [12]No data were provided, and the evaluation of its efficacy was confounded by the special circumstances of its use; the author used phenoxybenzamine, among other alpha-adrenergic antagonists, to blunt the transiently increased vasoconstriction that is associated with the release of norepinephrine by guanethidine, an effect that exacerbates the pain in RSD.We hypothesized that intravenous regional administration of the noncompetitive alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, combined with a local anesthetic, would prolong the period of effective sympathetic blockade after the treatment. The local anesthetic, lidocaine, was included to optimize patient comfort during the period that the limb was ischemic. The noncompetitive nature of the blockade by phenoxybenzamine results from an irreversible (covalent) binding of the agent to alpha-adrenergic receptors. [13]Because of the covalent bonding of the drug to the receptors, the block persists long after free drug has been cleared because the return of normal function depends on the synthesis of new receptors, a process that may require days. Because the drug would be expected to also bind irreversibly to nonspecific macromolecules in the treated limb, such binding would decrease the amount of drug available for systemic distribution when the tourniquet is released.Chronic oral use of phenoxybenzamine has been reported to be successful in the management of RSD, [4,11]but a problem has been the high incidence (43%[11]) of orthostatic hypotension; ejaculatory problems were also noted by some patients. It is expected that the regional approach would minimize or eliminate the occurrence of side effects that were observed with administration of large oral doses of phenoxybenzamine. The total regional dose of phenoxybenzamine that was approved in our IND application was 5 mg.It is possible that the effectiveness of intravenous regional blockade with phenoxybenzamine was related, in part, to the local anesthetic that was present in the formulation. The local anesthetic, predictably, made a large contribution to the pain relief in the immediate hours after the block (Figure 1). However, the long-term duration of symptom relief observed in our patients was significantly greater than that expected by the local anesthetic alone. There was a rather uniform rebound in pain scores recorded by all the patients in the early days after the procedure (Figure 1); this was followed by essentially complete resolution of the pain by the time of the early follow-up visit. The initial rebound approximated baseline pain scores in three of the five patients. We have considered that the transitory return of pain is a manifestation of the central sensitization that characterizes this pain syndrome, [2–4]which reappears after the effects of the local anesthetic have dissipated. The delay to final pain resolution may represent the time required for reversal of this central sensitization, a possible therapeutic effect of the prolonged sympathetic blockade produced by phenoxybenzamine.Of the five patients, the treatment was repeated only in patient 1. This patient had been symptom-free for 7 weeks after the initial treatment but reinjured the previously affected limb in a domestic accident. She immediately sought re-treatment, which was again successful. The data presented for this patient represent the results for the initial treatment, and the follow-up periods date to the first treatment. The other four patients had significant and prolonged symptom relief with a single treatment. At the time of the latest follow-up interview, all patients reported significant symptom relief and functional use of the previously affected extremity to the extent that repeat treatments were unwarranted. It has been observed [3,14]that RSD patients may get long-term pain relief if treated early. However, we also observed long-term pain relief in patients 1 and 4, who had experienced symptoms for 60 and 18 months, respectively.Intravenous regional blockade with phenoxybenzamine appeared to produce long-term symptom relief in our patients without any adverse effects. The interpretation of the results of the present case studies is severely limited by the fact that neither the patients nor the investigators were blinded to the treatment being used. Placebo influences may have contributed to the results that were obtained. The importance of this consideration is demonstrated by the studies of Blanchard et al., [15]which included intravenous regional blockade with saline as a control in a blinded comparison of guanethidine and reserpine for RSD; 83% of the saline-injected patients had pain relief that lasted more than 24 h. Allowance must also be made for the possibility of spontaneous resolution of symptoms, particularly in those patients who had relatively short histories of RSD.A controlled study, in which lidocaine alone is administered in a randomized, double-blind comparison with phenoxybenzamine plus lidocaine, is essential to evaluate the potential of this therapy for RSD and related disorders.*This formulation is approved in a Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug (IND) application under the aegis of New York Medical College.",

      "abstract": "SYNOPSIS Migraine has been hypothesized to be the clinical expression of a deficiency in pain modulating mechanisms. Abnormalities in opiate receptor responsiveness may be an aspect of this dysfunction. In migraine patients, i.v. administration of pentazocine (15 mg), a kappa and sigma opiate receptor agonist, provoked: (1) disturbances in visual and/or body image perception in 9 of the 24 treated patients, different from controls where these phenomena were never observed; (2) other symptoms which were also reported by controls; (3) miosis, without differences from controls. No differences between common and classical migraine sufferers were found. In patients complaining of perceptive disorders from pentazocine the other symptoms were longer lasting and miosis less intense than in the remaining patients, who responded to the drug as controls did. Two subgroups of patients could be defined, with and without pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, the former abnormally, the latter normally reacting to the drug. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.4 mg): (a) prevented pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, (b) shortened duration of the other symptoms in both patients and controls, (c) antagonized pentazocine‐induced miosis in controls but not in patients. It was discussed whether reduced miosis in patients with pentazocine‐induced perceptive disorders depends on a hyporesponsiveness of kappa receptors, or may be attributed to the sigma opiate receptor hyperreactivity upon which the perceptive disturbances seem to depend.",

      "abstract": "Neurologic deterioration following acute injury to the central nervous system may be amenable to pharmacologic intervention, although, to date, no such therapy exists. Ketamine is an anesthetic and analgesic emerging as a novel therapy for a number of clinical entities in recent years, including refractory pain, depression, and drug-induced hyperalgesia due to newly discovered mechanisms of action and new application of its known pharmacodynamics. In this focused review, the evidence for ketamine as a neuroprotective agent in stroke, neurotrauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and status epilepticus is highlighted, with a focus on its applications for excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and neuronal hyperexcitability. Preclinical modeling and clinical applications are discussed.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Two cases of Parkinsonian syndrome occurring after starting therapy with calcium inhibitors (verapamil in one case and diltiazem in the other) are reported. Complete regression of the symptoms after withdrawing the drugs was strongly in favour of a causal relationship. The condition could be due to inhibition of the calcium channels in the central nervous system disturbing neurotransmission. This seems to be a rare side effect as there have only been three other reported cases of secondary extrapyramidal syndromes in the literature. However, a Parkinsonian syndrome is very invalidating and clinicians using this family of drugs should be aware of this possible complication.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN9A neuropathic pain syndromes (SCN9A-NPS) comprise SCN9A erythromelalgia (EM), SCN9A paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), and SCN9A small fiber neuropathy (SFN). SCN9A-EM is characterized by recurrent episodes of bilateral intense, burning pain, and redness, warmth, and occasionally swelling. While the feet are more commonly affected than the hands, in severely affected individuals the legs, arms, face, and/or ears may be involved. SCN9A-PEPD is characterized by neonatal or infantile onset of autonomic manifestations that can include skin flushing, harlequin (patchy or asymmetric) color change, tonic non-epileptic attacks (stiffening), and syncope with bradycardia. Later manifestations are episodes of excruciating deep burning rectal, ocular, or submandibular pain accompanied by flushing (erythematous skin changes). SCN9A-SFN is characterized by adult-onset neuropathic pain in a stocking and glove distribution, often with a burning quality; autonomic manifestations such as dry eyes, mouth, orthostatic dizziness, palpitations, bowel or bladder disturbances; and preservation of large nerve fiber functions (normal strength, tendon reflexes, and vibration sense). Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN9A-NPS is established in a proband with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN9A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Most affected individuals are treated in dermatology clinics, neurology clinics, or pain clinics, or by anesthesiologists specializing in the management of chronic pain. SCN9A-EM. Cooling the extremities reduces pain; note that use of a fan is preferable to prolonged immersion in cold water, which can result in skin maceration, infection, and gangrene. Medications to consider are nonselective sodium channel blockers (e.g., carbamazepine, lidocaine infusion, or oral mexiletine). SCN9A-PEPD. Use of stool softeners and passing stool slowly to reduce the likelihood of triggering an attack. Carbamazepine is the most effective (albeit not completely effective) treatment in reducing the number and severity of attacks. Other anti-seizure medications with varying effectiveness include lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, and sodium valproate. SCN9A-SFN. Lacosamide is associated with reduced pain ratings, improved general well-being and sleep quality, but not with changed overall quality of life or autonomic manifestations. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist to assess for disease progression. Routine monitoring for side effects of medications used in treatment (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, liver toxicity, neutropenia seen with carbamazepine). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Triggers including warmth, standing, alcohol, and spicy foods (SCN9A-EM); defecation, cold wind, eating, and emotion (SCN9A-PEPD); diabetes mellitus, alcohol, and chemotherapy (SCN9A SFN). Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger relatives of an affected individual at risk for SCN9A-NPS in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from avoidance of activities that are known to trigger onset of pain. Pregnancy management: Potential teratogenic effects of medications used for treatment of SCN9A-NPS should be discussed with affected women of childbearing age, ideally prior to conception. Genetic counseling SCN9A neuropathic pain syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an individual with an NPS-causing variant in SCN9A has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant. Once the SCN9A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Formal thought disorder (FTD), studied even before the inception of the concept of schizophrenia, remains a deeply isolating experience for patients as well as a difficult one for their interlocutors, including clinicians. The views on language, paralinguistic, and extralinguistic features exhibited by patients with severe mental ill health are reviewed, including the contributions from 19th-century European authors to the last third of the 20th century. Stages in the construction of FTD are described, including its merging with Dementia Praecox, and its subsequently being shaped by notions such as primitive archaic thinking, paralogical or autistic thinking, concretism, overinclusive thinking, and the return of the efforts to describing it with increased reliability. It appears that some features of communication in schizophrenia, but not others, have been selected at different points in time for clinical and research use without realizing that by carrying out that selection, the phenomenon under study itself is changed. Remarkably, some theories of FTD remained in use, despite being empirically disproved (eg, word association disorder, concrete thinking, paralogical thinking) or despite its highly problematic and discriminatory nature. We would suggest that studies of FTD should explicitly consider which and why some of its features are included or excluded when assessing it. Furthermore, we would suggest that the study of FTD should incorporate the complexity of human communication, including the pragmatic, paralinguistic, non-verbal, and cognitive dimensions of the localized and unique situation where it takes place.",

      "title": "Akathisia and Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Akathisia (from the Greek for \"not to sit\") is a distressing side effect of some medications often prescribed to patients [1,2]. Akathisia usually presents with objective motor restlessness and subjective mental changes. Perioperative medications known to produce akathisia include droperidol, metoclopramide, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, naloxone, and flumazenil. Patient refusal to have surgery after the administration of droperidol has been repeatedly reported [3,4], but our literature search revealed only one case report of the cancellation of surgery after the administration of metoclopramide [5]. We believe that central nervous system side effects of this severity may be rare, but less severe effects of metoclopramide and other medications may be more common than appreciated. It is possible that there is substantial underdiagnosis and misinterpretation of acute akathisia because of unfamiliarity with the condition [6]. We report two cases of the cancellation of surgery by patients in our institution who displayed akathisia-like symptoms after they received an IV bolus of metoclopramide. After these episodes, we changed the way metoclopramide is given preoperatively. Case Report 1 A 30-yr-old man, ASA physical status II, with Hodgkin's disease presented for right cervical lymph node biopsy. He had received general anesthesia for a similar neck biopsy 1 yr earlier without complication. His other medical conditions included hypertension, asthma, esophageal reflux, sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He denied any history of psychiatric illness. His therapy included diltiazem, albuterol, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night. Examination showed a calm and cooperative man with unremarkable airway, chest, and cardiac findings. The patient was premedicated with sodium citrate 30 mL per os and metoclopramide 10 mg given IV for 1 min. On arrival in the operating room, approximately 4 min later, the patient stated that he was feeling \"funny.\" He complained, \"I have a feeling something bad is going to happen. I need to walk around!\" As he said this, he removed his IV line and walked out of the operating room. The symptoms improved after approximately 2 h, and the patient went home without undergoing surgery. In the following days, he was counseled by phone that his unpleasant experience may have been a reaction to the metoclopramide. Case Report 2 A 33-yr-old man, 74 kg, ASA physical status I, presented for surgical repair of a canalicular tear in his left eye. Clinical examination revealed a calm patient and no remarkable findings. Aspiration prophylaxis of 30 mL of Bicitra orally and 10 mg bolus of metoclopramide IV were given. Three minutes later, the patient became erratic and combative. He removed the IV cannula from his hand and left the hospital in the company of his wife, despite explanations that his feelings of discomfort were due to the medications just given. The patient was lost to further follow-up through this institution. Discussion Drugs that may produce akathisia are often prescribed to patients [1,2] (Table 1). Drug-induced akathisia (DIA) is often difficult to diagnose and may present in varying grades of severity. DIA is a psychoneuromotor phenomenon of an overwhelming compulsion to move and an inability to sit or stand still [2,7,8]. It is usually described as having a subjective mental or psychological component and an objective, observable motor component. Subjectively, the patient may describe an unpleasant feeling of inner restlessness or tension referable most commonly to the lower limbs. A desire to get up and walk, an inability to think properly, anxiety, and a sense of impending doom and fear of death have also been reported [7]. Violent and suicidal ideation has been reported as a manifestation of akathisia by patients being treated with neuroleptics [9,10]. The objective motor components include restlessness of the lower limbs in the form of rocking foot to foot, crossing and uncrossing of legs, and pacing. Less severe forms may present with mental changes without objective movement disorder, which may mimic or aggravate normal preoperative anxiety.Table 1: Drugs Implicated in Causing AkathisiaThe neuropharmacological basis of akathisia is still incompletely understood. A disturbance in the integrated function of the locus ceruleus, basal ganglion, and the limbic system brought about by dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and/or other neurotransmitters seems to be involved [11]. Disturbances in the dopaminergic modulation of the rich noradrenergic system in the spinal cord may have a role [11,12]. In addition, opioid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and cholinergic receptor systems are involved in modulating the dopaminergic and adrenergic systems. Interestingly, both droperidol and metoclopramide act, in part, via presynaptic dopamine antagonism [3,4]. An overactive adrenergic system secondary to presynaptic dopamine receptor block in key parts of the brain and spinal cord may be an oversimplified but useful way of looking at the mechanism of DIA [11]. The inner anxiety that patients occasionally feel when sedated with droperidol may perhaps be a manifestation of akathisia. The incidence of neuroleptic-induced akathisia in psychiatric patients is often underdiagnosed [6]. The reported incidence ranges from 8% to 76%, with 20%-30% being a conservative estimate [13]. The incidence is much higher in oncology patients treated with large-dose antiemetic therapy. The purposes of preoperative medications are to reduce stress, alleviate anxiety, and reduce perioperative risks. It is disturbing that these very medications may be causing extremely unpleasant mental changes. A high incidence of varying grades of akathisia in the perioperative period may be hidden by anesthesia, sedation, patient reluctance to complain, and/or the anesthesiologist's unfamiliarity with the condition. Mild forms of akathisia may masquerade as situational anxiety. On the other hand, previously unknown or undiagnosed psychiatric or behavioral disorders may manifest during the highly stressful perioperative period, confusing the diagnosis of akathisia. In the perioperative period, increased apprehension and restlessness ranged from 27% [14] to 45% [15] when droperidol was given as a premedication. This is in contrast to an incidence of similar symptoms of 0%-2% in control groups receiving placebo [3,15,18,21]. Reports include restlessness, agitation, or extrapyramidal effects with doses as small as 0.625 mg [16]. When Innovar (a mixture of fentanyl and droperidol) was popular as a premedicant, a significant number of patients refused surgery after receiving the drug [3,4]. Descriptions in many of these case reports are consistent with DIA. A patient who was a psychiatrist and an expert on drug-induced movement disorders had personal experience of akathisia induced by droperidol during surgery under epidural anesthesia [17]. Delayed restlessness caused by droperidol has also been reported after general anesthesia in ambulatory surgical patients [18]. Metoclopramide has been linked to akathisia in many reports [5,19,23,24]. In a study of the effect of metoclopramide on prolactin and aldosterone, the incidence of akathisia was 25% after receiving 10 mg of metoclopramide IV [19]. In another study of nonsurgical patients, metoclopramide in a dose of 10 mg orally qid produced symptoms attributable to akathisia in 10% of subjects [20]. In all cases, the signs and symptoms included motor restlessness, a desire to get up and walk around, racing thoughts, anxiety, and/or a sense of impending doom. In the perioperative setting, Dundee et al. [21] and Dundee and Clarke [22] reported 12% and 26% incidence of restlessness after an IM injection of 10 and 20 mg of metoclopramide, respectively. Of 14 patients, 3 developed restlessness during eye surgery when a combination of droperidol and metoclopramide was given as premedication [23]. For IV 10-mg bolus doses of metoclopramide, the incidence of restlessness seems to be 20%-25% [19,24]. The speed of administration seems to be an important factor in determining the incidence of akathisia induced by metoclopramide [24,25]. Patients who received metoclopramide via oral or IM routes had a lower incidence of akathisia compared with reports of incidents with IV administered metoclopramide. Metoclopramide-induced akathisia was reduced from 18.5% to 0% when 10 mg was diluted and given slowly over 10 min. Interestingly, both patients in our report received a rapid IV administration (<or=to1 min) of metoclopramide. Anxiety or restlessness was reduced when a sedative medication was coadministered [23]. Prevention of akathisia also includes identifying patients at risk of developing DIA and properly determining the risks and benefits of using metoclopramide. There seems to be a bimodally increased incidence with respect to age (<30 or >60 yr) [28,29]. Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, renal disease, and oncologic diagnosis, and women, have all shown an increased susceptibility to extrapy-ramidal reactions [30]. Patients with a history of DIA and those taking centrally acting medications chronically may also be at higher risk [28,29]. Theoretical alternatives to metoclopramide for the indication of reducing gastric volumes include cisapride or domperidone. Cisapride acts by facilitating the release of acetylcholine from the myenteric plexus and has no central side effects. Domperidone is a peripheral dopamine antagonist that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. However, we are not aware of studies analyzing these drugs for use in the perioperative period. After diagnosing an episode of DIA, prompt treatment includes discontinuation of the offending drug and initiation of treatment to reduce unpleasant symptoms. Benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, alpha2-agonists, opiates, and anticholinergics have all been used to treat akathisia [2,5,16]. Anticholinergic drugs seem to be more successful in relieving all symptoms of akathisia, whereas benzodiazepines tend to relieve the subjective components best. Centrally acting anticholinergics presumably restore the relative balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic activity. Diphenhydramine has also been used effectively [16]. We believe that drugs commonly administered in the perioperative period have the potential of inducing akathisia. Less severe forms may go unrecognized or may be misdiagnosed as anxiety. The more severe forms may result in refusal of surgery, as in our case reports, and in unpredictable, violent behavior [10,26] or suicidal ideation [9,27], all of which may have serious consequences. Avoidance of akathisia-inducing medications, awareness of the condition of DIA, injecting metoclopramide slowly, and administration of adjuvant opioid or sedative medications are important in reducing akathisia symptoms. In our practice, we now administer metoclopramide as a \"piggy back\" drip (10 mg/100 mL isotonic sodium chloride solution) or administer divided bolus doses up to the total dose over no less than 3 min. In addition, we give preoperative anxiolytics before metoclopramide unless contraindicated by comorbid conditions. If akathisia does occur, prompt recognition and treatment with anticholinergics or benzodiapines are necessary. On resolution of symptoms, the patient should be counseled that the experience may have been drug-induced.",

      "title": "Akathisia and Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Akathisia (from the Greek for \"not to sit\") is a distressing side effect of some medications often prescribed to patients [1,2]. Akathisia usually presents with objective motor restlessness and subjective mental changes. Perioperative medications known to produce akathisia include droperidol, metoclopramide, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, naloxone, and flumazenil. Patient refusal to have surgery after the administration of droperidol has been repeatedly reported [3,4], but our literature search revealed only one case report of the cancellation of surgery after the administration of metoclopramide [5]. We believe that central nervous system side effects of this severity may be rare, but less severe effects of metoclopramide and other medications may be more common than appreciated. It is possible that there is substantial underdiagnosis and misinterpretation of acute akathisia because of unfamiliarity with the condition [6]. We report two cases of the cancellation of surgery by patients in our institution who displayed akathisia-like symptoms after they received an IV bolus of metoclopramide. After these episodes, we changed the way metoclopramide is given preoperatively. Case Report 1 A 30-yr-old man, ASA physical status II, with Hodgkin's disease presented for right cervical lymph node biopsy. He had received general anesthesia for a similar neck biopsy 1 yr earlier without complication. His other medical conditions included hypertension, asthma, esophageal reflux, sleep apnea, and morbid obesity. He denied any history of psychiatric illness. His therapy included diltiazem, albuterol, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night. Examination showed a calm and cooperative man with unremarkable airway, chest, and cardiac findings. The patient was premedicated with sodium citrate 30 mL per os and metoclopramide 10 mg given IV for 1 min. On arrival in the operating room, approximately 4 min later, the patient stated that he was feeling \"funny.\" He complained, \"I have a feeling something bad is going to happen. I need to walk around!\" As he said this, he removed his IV line and walked out of the operating room. The symptoms improved after approximately 2 h, and the patient went home without undergoing surgery. In the following days, he was counseled by phone that his unpleasant experience may have been a reaction to the metoclopramide. Case Report 2 A 33-yr-old man, 74 kg, ASA physical status I, presented for surgical repair of a canalicular tear in his left eye. Clinical examination revealed a calm patient and no remarkable findings. Aspiration prophylaxis of 30 mL of Bicitra orally and 10 mg bolus of metoclopramide IV were given. Three minutes later, the patient became erratic and combative. He removed the IV cannula from his hand and left the hospital in the company of his wife, despite explanations that his feelings of discomfort were due to the medications just given. The patient was lost to further follow-up through this institution. Discussion Drugs that may produce akathisia are often prescribed to patients [1,2] (Table 1). Drug-induced akathisia (DIA) is often difficult to diagnose and may present in varying grades of severity. DIA is a psychoneuromotor phenomenon of an overwhelming compulsion to move and an inability to sit or stand still [2,7,8]. It is usually described as having a subjective mental or psychological component and an objective, observable motor component. Subjectively, the patient may describe an unpleasant feeling of inner restlessness or tension referable most commonly to the lower limbs. A desire to get up and walk, an inability to think properly, anxiety, and a sense of impending doom and fear of death have also been reported [7]. Violent and suicidal ideation has been reported as a manifestation of akathisia by patients being treated with neuroleptics [9,10]. The objective motor components include restlessness of the lower limbs in the form of rocking foot to foot, crossing and uncrossing of legs, and pacing. Less severe forms may present with mental changes without objective movement disorder, which may mimic or aggravate normal preoperative anxiety.Table 1: Drugs Implicated in Causing AkathisiaThe neuropharmacological basis of akathisia is still incompletely understood. A disturbance in the integrated function of the locus ceruleus, basal ganglion, and the limbic system brought about by dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and/or other neurotransmitters seems to be involved [11]. Disturbances in the dopaminergic modulation of the rich noradrenergic system in the spinal cord may have a role [11,12]. In addition, opioid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and cholinergic receptor systems are involved in modulating the dopaminergic and adrenergic systems. Interestingly, both droperidol and metoclopramide act, in part, via presynaptic dopamine antagonism [3,4]. An overactive adrenergic system secondary to presynaptic dopamine receptor block in key parts of the brain and spinal cord may be an oversimplified but useful way of looking at the mechanism of DIA [11]. The inner anxiety that patients occasionally feel when sedated with droperidol may perhaps be a manifestation of akathisia.

In recent years certain patterns of neurotoxicity have, however, emerged. 2,4,5 Aside from occasional adverse effects on the psyche and obtundation from either overdose or idiosyncratic susceptibility, the chief neurotoxic manifestations take the form of abnormal movements, not unlike those seen in diseases of the extrapyramidal system.

      "abstract": "Introduction It is difficult to establish whether a patient has late onset schizophrenia or frontotemporal dementia. The object of the following case report is to point out the difficulty of making a differential diagnosis between these two entities. Case summary A 49-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital after presenting with auditory and visual hallucinations, formal thought disorder, persecutory delusions, ideas of reference, insomnia. Memory, executive function and attentional tasks were severely compromised. Computerized tomography showed incipient frontal lobe atrophy. There were no significant abnormalities found in blood and urine samples or physical and neurological examinations. After showing no response to olanzapine, and extrapyramidal side effects to fluphenazine, risperidone was initiated which subsequently led to complete withdrawal of positive symptoms. Discussion Patients presenting with psychotic symptoms after the age of 40 presented a diagnostic quandary, as they were less likely to present with negative symptoms, formal thought disorder or affective blunting, and more likely to have systematised delusions and visual hallucinations. Frontotemporal dementia is a disorder that can present itself with cognitive decline and a large range of psychiatric symptoms. The risk of late onset schizophrenia is greater in women, possibly implicating a causative role of female sex hormones. Atypical antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine seem to be an adequate treatment. Conclusion Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease with a large variety of clinical manifestations. Special care should be given to patients with age over 40, including neurocognitive assessment, laboratory and hormone tests, and a long-term follow-up.

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") is a unique drug, sharing properties of hallucinogens and stimulants. The acute effects of empathy, euphoria, and excitement for which it is used recreationally can make it overwhelmingly distracting for the user in the context of driving. This review considers the chemistry, synthesis, analysis, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and documented effects of MDMA on cognitive and psychomotor skills important to driving. Laboratory studies show that users do experience cognitive impairments, and may also act more impulsively while under the influence of the drug's sympathomimetic effects. Psychomotor impairment may occur with elevated doses or after repeated administration, and residual psychomotor impairment during the \"coming-down\" phase may be compounded by fatigue, dehydration, combined drug use, or other confounding factors. There is growing anecdotal information providing evidence of MDMA-impaired driving, and it is evident that many users recognize and attempt to mitigate the effects by delaying driving until the acute affects have dissipated. The drug inevitably may affect a subject's judgment and ability to properly assess their fitness to drive also. Blood concentrations in MDMA-impaired drivers suggest that this impairment can be caused by normal patterns of recreational use, and MDMA use should be considered inconsistent with safe driving immediately following ingestion, and for up to a day or longer following use.",

Skeletal-muscle spasm or muscular splinting may be considered to be a persistent, painful, and reversible contracture of striated muscle, usually localized to an area of trauma, inflammatory disease, or other pathological process not amenable to voluntary control.

      "abstract": "Drugs are useful in the symptomatic treatment of hyperkinetic and perceptually handicapped children, but their administration should be preceded by a careful clinical evaluation. On the basis of present evidence, short-term trials of drugs are justified as an adjunct to remedial methods of education. Central nervous system stimulants are the agents of choice. Chlordiazepoxide and chlorpromazine are recommended as alternative agents in patients who fail to respond to methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine. Diphenylhydantoin sodium or primidone, alone or in combination with a stimulant or antianxiety or antipsychotic agent, is indicated when signs and symptoms of minimal brain dysfunction include seizures or electroencephalographic evidence of epilepsy. Phenobarbital usually exacerbates hyperactivity and is contraindicated. The use of central nervous system stimulants and mood-modifying agents for prolonged periods should await further evaluation by long-term controlled studies.",

      "abstract": "Cyclizine hydrochloride (1-benzhydryl-4-methylpiperazine monohydrochloride) is a popular remedy for motion-sickness. The success which is reputed to attend the use of the drug in this condition may be a function of of two distinct effects: ( a ) a direct, specific inhibition of the vestibular mechanism; ( b ) a general, central inhibition or sedation. A consideration of the latter, rather than the former, suggested the possibility that cyclizine might prove to be of value as a potential “tranquillizer”. A controlled clinical trial was carried out in order to establish whether any tranquillizing effects might be associated with the use of the drug in a number of chronic psychotics, all of whom manifested some gross disturbance of behaviour. This paper describes the experimental method which was used; the results which were obtained; and a general comment upon the possible implications of the results in relation to other drugs used in psychiatry.",

The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

Drug treatment may be considered in the overall treatment of comorbid conditions. Lifetime risk of any eating disorder is 8.4% in women and 2.2% in men. Those with eating disorders may misuse medication and substances to manage their weight (e.g. laxatives, diuretics, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder stimulants, slimming pills, semaglutide and caffeine). Other psychiatric conditions (particularly anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder) often coexist with eating disorders, and this may in part explain the benefit sometimes seen with medication. Doubts remain about the long‐term cardiovascular effects of stimulant drugs.

      "title": "Considerations on third generation antihistamines",
      "abstract": "For several months now, the term ‘third generation of antihistamines’ has emerged spontaneously from the medical literature. These attempts at definition, which vary greatly, create confusion both for the health professionals and the lay public. This is of considerable concern for the scientific community involved in allergy, mainly due to the lack of consensus. One definition refers to the active metabolites of new second generation drugs as the basis for a third one [1,2]. Others are focused on certain specific properties: no electrocardiogram (ECG) effects [3], rapid onset of action [4] or no drug interactions [3]. First generation antihistamines were defined by their H1 receptor blocking power and despite pronounced unwanted side-effects are still often used mainly in over-the-counter (OTC) products, alone or in combination with other drugs. The second generation antihistamines are said to be ‘non-sedating H1 blockers’ due to the lack of penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Compared to the first generation, they are known for their high potency and minimal central nervous system (CNS) effects. Numerous compounds have been created responding to their own pharmacokinetics. Some of them undergo extensive metabolism, others do not. Cardiotoxic effects emerged with some second generation antihistamines and most of the new compounds exhibit properties on systems other than H1 receptors, i.e. anti-inflammatory properties. Certainly, the second generation manifests a great diversity. Which criteria should drugs have to fulfil to be labelled as third generation antihistamine? This is obviously for the scientific community to answer. To pave the way for the elaboration of a consensual definition and with the support of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology, a Consensus Group on New Generation Antihistamines (CONGA) has been set up. This Group is led by Professor S. T. Holgate (UK) and includes Professor G. W. Canonica (Italy), Dr G. Scadding (UK), Professor F. Estelle R. Simons (Canada), Professor M. Tharp (USA), Professor H. Timmerman (the Netherlands) and Professor K. Yanai (Japan), so that there will be a multidisciplinary input. This exercise is closely linked to the Southampton Workshop ‘Antihistamines: Back to the Future’[5] and should appear as a necessary sequel after a 4-year evolution of the antihistamine class. The Consensus Group met for the first time at the University of Leuven (Belgium), June 11–12, 2001, and made clear the necessity to clarify the theme with the help of international experts representing the different fields involved in allergy. Respecting a strictly academic approach, the Consensus Group agreed on the following aims: (a) to review in depth the present status of the term ‘third generation antihistamines’, (b) to analyse the potential criteria that drugs should fulfil to be labelled as third generation, (c) to find gaps and to bridge them with the back-up of expert networking, and (d) to issue a consensual statement endorsed by the scientific community.",

      "abstract": "Over the last few years, a number of cases of extrapyramidal disorders associated with trimetazidine (TMZ) use has been reported. Here, we report on a series of 21 cases. All but one of the patients (mean age 74) had been taking TMZ for several years. The indication for prescription of TMZ could not be identified in seven cases. The TMZ-associated adverse drug reactions were typical parkinsonism (akinesia and/or rigidity and/or rest tremor) in 17 cases, gait disorders in three cases (one with orthostatic tremor), and restless leg syndrome in one case. Discontinuation of TMZ led to complete disappearance of the symptoms in 16 cases and a significant reduction in the five other patients. TMZ has the same piperazine core as the dopamine antagonists flunarizine and cinnarizine (both of which have been reported to induce extrapyramidal symptoms). Hence, striatal D2 receptor blockade could result in the onset or the worsening of extrapyramidal disorders. Even though this adverse drug reaction is now listed in TMZ's Summary of Product Characteristics (because of the initial reports), the risk remains poorly known by clinicians. There is a need to raise awareness of this phenomenon and to reassess TMZ 's risk-benefit ration, especially in the elderly.",

Clinical symptoms of this disorder vary with blood levels of methemoglobin. Potential interactions can occur between vasoconstrictors and other drugs with adrenergic activity. These interactions affect heart rate and blood pressure.

In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents.

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms.

      "abstract": "TCA are used for the treatment of major depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, chronic pain syndromes, and peripheral neuropathies associated with psychiatric and medical conditions that call for a higher rate of prescription drugs. Frequently observed toxic symptoms are sinus tachycardia and altered mental status. Severe toxic symptoms include altered mental status, dysrhythmia, seizure, and secondary complications. Serious cardiotoxicity can lead to ventricular dysrhythmia and a classic TCA electrocardiogram. Gluteal myonecrosis is reported in postoperative alcoholic states, unconscious conditions where patients remain in one position over a long period of time, strenuous physical training, or in crushing injuries. We report a case of gluteal myonecrosis after treatment with several drugs including TCA resulted in intoxication. The patient was mentally drowsy and had been lying down for 20 hours upon discovery. The patient presented on arrival to the ER with cardiotoxicity secondary to TCA intoxication and was treated. Two weeks following the incident, she complained of pain in the gluteal area. Subsequent management and investigation revealed that her gluteal myonecrosis was a result of delayed complication from a prolonged recumbent position and hemolysis due to drug interactions. She eventually recovered without the need for surgery (fasciotomy).",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse has become a social and medical problem. Amphetamine and cocaine have a potent sympathicomimetic action, so they have important effects on the Central Nervous and Cardiovascular Systems. Their neurological complications are principally: psychic alterations, seizures and stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic). The latter are the most important in the clinical practice. Their capacity to produce transit arterial hypertension and cerebral vascular constriction could be the physiopathological substrate of such alterations. Angiographic studies have shown lesions suggesting vasculopathy. In the last ten years cocaine abuse has become an authentic epidemic. We have reviewed its neurological complications, particularly the vascular ones--42 hemorrhagic and 24 ischemic--and the following conclusions were drawn: it should be considered as a risk factor in the younger age group; a short period of time between the last drug dose and the clinical picture is frequently seen; clinical features may appear with the first drug administration; no characteristic lesion in relation to the way of administration or consumption time was elicited.",

      "title": "Disulfiram-induced seizure in a patient with alcohol dependence syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Disulfiram (DSF) has been used in the management of alcohol dependence as a deterrent agent for over 50 years, and it has been shown to be efficacious when taken under supervision. In addition to the physical symptoms associated with the concomitant use of alcohol, DSF may lead to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) when used alone, which are flushing, throbbing headache, perspiration, etc., DSF has an acceptable risk profile. However, it is associated with many adverse events and drug–drug interactions, including death. The most common less serious adverse effects include headache, sleepiness, tiredness, and halitosis (or metallic taste). Its toxicity may present different clinical aspects, though the mechanism (direct or idiosyncratic) remains unclear. Dermatological, neurological, psychiatric, and cardiac events have been reported. Serious side effects include hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, psychosis, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuritis.[1] There are very few case reports regarding DSF-induced seizures.[23] This shows the need for research, especially in the Indian context, when alcohol consuming population and the wide use of DSF (sometimes surreptitiously) in de-addiction centers are considered. However, because of the ADRs and the dangerous effects of DSF with alcohol, it has to be prescribed with caution and always monitored by medical supervision. Mr. SD, a 40-year-old married male, diagnosed with alcohol dependence for the past 5 years, presented with uncomplicated withdrawal symptoms. Detoxification was done using benzodiazepines in tapering dose, and oral thiamine supplementation was initiated. Investigations including complete blood count, blood sugar, and liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. After he gave written informed consent, DSF was started at a dose of 250 mg at daytime as an aversive agent and increased to 500 mg per day after 1 week. He was also receiving quetiapine 50 mg for sleep disturbances. His birth and developmental history was unremarkable. There was no past or family history of major medical or psychiatric illness. He had been on regular medications under the supervision of a family member and abstinent from alcohol. After 6 weeks, he presented with an episode of generalized tonic–clonic seizure, characterized by sudden-onset, tonic–clonic movements of the extremities with up rolling of the eyeball, frothing from the mouth, and tongue bite. Although there was no incontinence, the whole episode lasted for about 1–2 min. The patient remained confused for few minutes after the event. Subsequently, he was rushed to the hospital and admitted in the neurology ward. There was no history of alcohol intake during this period, or history of other substance abuse. After admission, he was treated with tablet phenytoin 300 mg/day. All routine blood investigations (random blood sugar, serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and complete blood count) were normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy, and electroencephalogram showed generalized spikes. He was discharged after 2 days with tablet quetiapine 50 mg/day, tablet lorazepam 1 mg at night, and tablet phenytoin 300 mg/day. After discharge, he continued to follow-up in the psychiatric outpatient department (OPD). Tablet phenytoin was tapered up after 1 month. After 4 months of discharge, there was no relapse of seizure. We did not restart tablet DSF considering a possibility of DSF-induced seizure. The patient is continuing to follow-up in the psychiatry OPD, maintaining abstinence now and seizure free without antiepileptic. Isolated seizure episode in a patient with alcohol dependence can be because of various reasons such as alcohol withdrawal, head injury under the influence of alcohol, or electrolyte imbalance or related to drugs. The Possibility of withdrawal seizure was ruled out as he had one episode of seizure after 6 weeks of stopping alcohol. As per family members and his gamma-glutamyl transferase level, it was clear that he did not take alcohol before admission to the hospital. As CT scan of the brain did not reveal any head injury and his electrolyte levels were normal, these two reasons can be excluded as the reason for seizure. When the patient had seizure, he was on tablet DSF 500 mg/day, tablet lorazepam 1 mg/day, and tablet quetiapine 50 mg/day. As there was no history of seizure in the past and no relapse of seizure after stoppage of DSF and antiepileptic, it indicates a possibility of DSF-induced seizure. To substantiate our assumption, we applied Naranjo Scale for adverse effect and the score was 7, which indicates its probable causal relation between DSF and seizure.[4] This pattern of adverse effects appearing with increase in duration of drug exposure has been described in the nervous system. There is literature to suggest that the latency time from the start of treatment to the manifestation of the ADR differed according to the organ. Hepatitis occurred with a distinct peak after 2 months of treatment, skin reactions peaked after 2 weeks, and the rate of neurological ADR increased with the duration of therapy.[5] There are rare case reports of seizures associated with DSF. A recent review of literature revealed few reports in which the patients had generalized convulsions.[6] Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), a toxic metabolite of DSF, increases the release of glutamate from striato-cortical synaptic vesicles, suggesting a possible mechanism for DDC-mediated neuronal damage and development of seizures.[7] Norepinephrine depletion with DSF exacerbates seizures and facilitates seizure kindling.[8] DSF has a moderate record of adverse effects. Apart from DSF alcoholic reaction, evidence suggest that DSF when used alone can cause various side effects including seizures, which are rare but need to be considered. Awareness among clinicians about DSF-induced seizures in the management of alcohol dependence appears practical to prevent misdiagnosis of seizures attributable to other reasons.

      "title": "A case of clozapine-induced stuttering in a HIV-positive individual",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Stuttering, a speech disorder marked by disruptions in fluency, can be developmental or acquired. Acquired stuttering often stems from neurological causes, psychological trauma or certain medications, with antipsychotics such as clozapine implicated in several cases. Clozapine, particularly at higher doses, has been associated with dose-dependent stuttering although the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. While clozapine’s effects dopamine pathways and seizure thresholds are proposed mechanisms, movement disorders such as focal dystonia and prior extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSEs) are also implicated. Patient presentation: A 40-year-old man with HIV, schizophrenia and a history of previous severe dystonic reaction to typical antipsychotics, developed stuttering after initiation of clozapine. His stuttering was accompanied by involuntary oral movements. Management and outcome: The patient’s psychotic symptoms were found to be treatment-resistant, unresponsive to trials of two antipsychotics, and thus necessitating the initiation of clozapine. Following clozapine administration, the patient developed stuttering, which was unresponsive to benzodiazepine therapy and showed no abnormalities on electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment. Gradual resolution of stuttering was observed upon clozapine discontinuation and a switch to amisulpiride. Conclusion: Clozapine was identified as the likely cause of stuttering in the presence of additional risk factors such as HIV and a history of EPSEs. Contribution: This case highlights the importance of recognising clozapine-induced stuttering.",

      "abstract": "Post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) is a constellation of serious adverse side effects manifested in clinical symptoms that develop and persist in patients during and/or after discontinuing finasteride treatment in men with pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) or benign prostatic hyperplasia. These serious adverse side effects include persistent or irreversible sexual, neurological, physical and mental side effects. To date, there are no evidence-based effective treatments for PFS. Although increasing number of men report persistent side effects, the medical community has yet to recognize this syndrome nor are there any specific measures to address this serious and debilitating symptoms. Here we evaluate the scientific and clinical evidence in the contemporary medical literature to address the very fundamental question: Is PFS a real clinical condition caused by finasteride use or are the reported symptoms only incidentally associated with but not caused by finasteride use? One key indisputable clinical evidence noted in all reported studies with finasteride and dutasteride was that use of these drugs is associated with development of sexual dysfunction, which may persist in a subset of men, irrespective of age, drug dose or duration of study. Also, increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation in a subset of men treated with these drugs were commonly reported in a number of studies. It is important to note that many clinical studies suffer from incomplete or inadequate assessment of adverse events and often limited or inaccurate data reporting regarding harm. Based on the existing body of evidence in the contemporary clinical literature, the author believes that finasteride and dutasteride induce a constellation of persistent sexual, neurological and physical adverse side effects, in a subset of men. These constellations of symptoms constitute the basis for PFS in individuals predisposed to epigenetic susceptibility. Indeed, delineating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PFS will be of paramount importance to the understanding of this syndrome and to development of potential novel therapeutic modalities.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

We describe five patients in whom tremor occurred after chronic treatment with neuroleptics, was aggravated by and persisted after neuroleptic withdrawal, and improved after treatment with the dopamine depleting drug tetrabenazine. This involuntary oscillatory movement, with a frequency range of 3–5 Hz, was most prominent during maintenance of a posture, but was also present at rest and during a goal‐directed movement. The tremor was accompanied by other tardive movement disorders, including akathisia, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, and stereotypy. There was no family history or other explanation for tremor in these patients. We suggest that this hitherto unreported movement disorder is best termed “tardive tremor”.",

Psychiatrists, sociologists, and professionals in allied fields have emphasized the advantages of maintaining the mentally ill in the community. Permanent neurological disorders have become very common among patients treated with neuroleptics, but little effort has been made to come to grips with this problem. Neuroleptics may reduce overactivity and belligerent behavior, but these are secondary effects of a general lessening of psychopathology. Sedation occurs only in the early stages of drug therapy in certain susceptible individuals or when excessive doses are administered, particularly of chlorpromazine. The widespread prescribing of potentially dangerous drugs has been particularly evident in the field of psychopharmacology because of its role in a rapidly expanding and changing program of mental health care. Tardive dyskinesia becomes more pronounced after drugs are withdrawn, a fact that skeptics have used to question its existence as a clinical entity.",

We compared the efficacy of amitriptyline (25 mg/day) in 82 nondepressed patients with either chronic or episodic tension‐type headache in an open‐label study. Amitriptyline significantly reduced ( P &lt;0.05) frequency and duration of headache as well as analgesic consumption in chronic, but not in episodic, tension‐type headache. Further placebo‐controlled trials, possibly with higher doses of amitriptyline, might confirm if the different pattern of response to amitriptyline can be explained in terms of different involvement of central nociception and of peripheral myofascial factors in the chronic and in the episodic forms of tension‐type headache.",

      "abstract": "Two patients with tardive dystonia are presented. Tardive dystonia is a late-onset side effect of dopamine antagonist, which occurs in approximately 2% of the patients in the course of treatment with neuroleptic medication. The dystonia usually starts by affecting the musculature of face and (or) neck and is often progressive to a segmental localization. Of differential diagnostic importance are: conversion disorder, acute dystonia, Wilson's disease, idiopathic dystonia and dystonia triggered by other agents. Treatment starts with reevaluation of the need for ongoing neuroleptic treatment. Investigation of the pharmacotherapy of the dystonia concerns mostly treatment with dopamine depletors or with high doses of anticholinergic agents. Improvement of 50% of the patients is reported, although total recovery is rare. Many other substances and also some physical methods (ECT and surgery) have been used with varying results.",

      "title": "When and How to Investigate the Patient with Headache",
      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

It is often attributed to the effect of multiple transfusions, transfusion reaction, absorption of blood from hematomas, or preexisting liver disease. Occasionally, the jaundice in such patients may be severe and may closely resemble obstructive jaundice. Examination to exclude obstructive jaundice may be hampered by postoperative abdominal tenderness, ileus, or depressed mental function due to head trauma. The effects of anesthesia and a wide variety of drugs must also be considered. Although hepatic dysfunction following trauma has been well described in the literature, the large number of factors involved in clinical cases has made determination of the underlying mechanisms difficult.

      "title": "<scp>Kinesigenic</scp> Triggers in Episodic Ataxia Type 1",
      "abstract": "Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) (MIM 160120) is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with KCNA1 mutations, encoding for the alpha subunit of the delayed rectifier potassium ion channel Kv1.1.1 It usually presents in childhood with intermittent attacks of short-lasting imbalance, dizziness, and sometimes interictal painful cramping and muscle contractions, variably reported as neuromyotonia, myokymia, or dystonia.2, 3 Premonitory sensory symptoms may occur, and attacks may be triggered by startle, vigorous activity, changes in posture, emotion, hunger, alcohol, or intercurrent illness.4, 5 EA1 was described by Van Dyke in 1975 and associated with KCNA1 mutations in 2004.6, 7 Pre-genetic era reports mentioned kinesigenic triggers and sometimes the co-existence of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD).5, 8 PKD (MIM 128200) is a clinical syndrome characterized by short bouts of dyskinesia triggered by sudden initiation of movement, such as rising from a chair or running after standing for some time.9 PKD is associated with mutations in the PRRT2 gene in 27–65% of patients, with other genes involved including KCNA1.10, 11 This apparent allelic heterogeneity had been implicated in earlier reports but has not been revisited. We sought to explore the presence of kinesigenic triggers in patients with a clinical and molecular diagnosis of EA1. Using a database of all EA1 published cases, we retrieved 86 EA1 subjects with confirmed pathogenic KCNA1 mutations from 20 articles published between 1994 and 2017 (Supporting Information). Demographic and clinical data from this cohort are seen in Table 1. Data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS software; analysis of statistical significance was done using the Chi-square test when comparing categorical variables. Trigger data was available in 87.2% of cases (75/86), with kinesigenic triggers reported in 68% (51/75). These were often described as sudden movements (of a limb or head) or changes in posture, such as standing up from a seated position. Presence of kinesigenic triggers was associated with interictal myokymia (77.3% vs. 38.1%, χ2 P = 0.002), higher attack frequency (daily in 46.8% vs. 18.8%, χ2 P = 0.048), and acetazolamide responsiveness (complete/partial remission 63.2% vs. 12.5%, χ2 P = 0.016). Daily 25/64 (39.1) Weekly 25/64 (39.1) Monthly 6/64 (9.4) Rare/sporadic 8/64 (12.5) Generalizability of our findings is limited as data were collected indirectly through a literature review, comprised mostly of retrospective observational studies that are prone to recall and selection bias and may overestimate the presence of kinesigenic triggers in EA1. A smaller prospective study reported sudden movement as a trigger in 9/33 cases (27.3%).3 Other papers reported “postural changes” as a trigger, but it is unclear from clinical descriptions whether this represented purely a kinesigenic trigger or some other mechanism. Finally, the association with interictal and clinical features is exploratory, and direct causal relationship cannot be inferred. The limited understanding of pathophysiology of EA1 renders the relationship between phenotype and triggers mysterious. The Kv1.1 channel is expressed in the juxtaparanodal region of peripheral nerves and cerebellar basket cells. KCNA1 pathogenic mutations exert a dominant-negative effect with channel dysfunction leading to neuronal hyperexcitability, potentially explaining neuromyotonia/myokymia in the peripheral nervous system.4 Centrally, KCNA1 mutations in mice lead to increased GABAergic output from basket cells to the Purkinje cell axon hillock, causing deep cerebellar nuclei disinhibition.12, 13 Cerebellar involvement has also been demonstrated in PRRT2 mutations, causing altered synaptic input from granular cells to Purkinje cells.14 These findings suggest a shared role of kinesigenic triggers, network excitability and cerebellar dysfunction in KCNA1 and PRRT2.15, 16 Notwithstanding limitations in our study, our results are informative. The prevalence of kinesigenic triggers in KCNA1-EA1 is clinically relevant, particularly in limited resource settings where genetic testing is unavailable. Future studies may attempt to describe attack features and triggers in more detail, ascertaining sensitivity and specificity of kinesigenic triggers to differentiate forms of episodic ataxia.

Such interactions may, in a few conditions, explain unforeseen adverse effects, and, more frequently, they disturb the meaning of plasma determinations of the monitored drugs. Some interactions can be pharmacokinetic, principally by way of enzyme induction or enzyme inhibition, and than they lead to disturbances in the plasma levels of the active substances. On the other hand, interactions can take place at the pharmacodynamic level, which is as an important condition although it is less well-known. Some examples are given for both mechanisms.",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf.

Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw.

Neurologic adverse reactions to nefopam are confusion, hallucinations, delirium and convulsions. There are several reports about fatal convulsive seizures, presumably related to nefopam. A 71-year-old man was admitted for surgery for a lumbar spinal stenosis. He was administered intravenous analgesics : ketorolac, tramadol, orphenadrine citrate and nefopam HCl. His back pain was so severe that he hardly slept for several days; he even needed morphine and pethidine. At 4 days of administration of intravenous analgesics, the patient suddenly started generalized tonic-clonic seizures for 15 seconds, and subsequently, status epilepticus; these were not responsive to phenytoin and midazolam. After 3 days of barbiturate coma therapy the seizures were controlled. Convulsive seizures related to nefopam appear as focal, generalized, myoclonic types, or status epilepticus, and are not dose-related manifestations. In our case, the possibility of convulsions caused by other drugs or the misuse of drugs was considered. However, we first identified the introduced drugs and excluded the possibility of an accidental misuse of other drugs. Physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of unpredictable and serious convulsions when using nefopam.",

This category includes chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, tics, and tremor. 2) Hypokinetic movement disorders refers to akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movement), bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. Parkinsonism is the primary hypokinetic movement disorder. Movement disorders may be further categorized into primary and secondary disorders. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is the primary manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, a broader structural, toxic, metabolic, or inherited etiologic factor is responsible for the symptoms.",

What has not been emphasized in the literature is how stereotyped these hallucinations are. Entirely visual, as is characteristic of the organic hallucination, they occur in the parkinsonian patient not only as a consequence of levodopa administration, but also as a manifestation of anticholinergic medications, such as trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride (Artane), benztropine (Cogentin) mesylate, and procyclidine hydrochloride (Kemadrin). The visual hallucinations that occur with the use of anticholinergic medication seem identical to those evoked by levodopa, and the same series of hallucinations in a single patient may be produced by either. It has been my experience that if the patient is receiving both levodopa and an anticholinergic drug, discontinuation of anticholinergic therapy will generally result in alleviation of the hallucinations. But most peculiarly of all, the characteristic",

      "abstract": "A diagnosis of epilepsy is made when a person experiences two or more unprovoked seizures, i.e. seizures without an immediate precipitating event such as fever, a blow to the head, active brain infection, or metabolic disturbance. Epileptic seizures result from abnormal electrical discharges which may be confined to a part of the brain or involve the entire cortex. The diagnostic classification system initially developed by the Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy (1989) reflects both the manner in which the seizure begins (partial versus generalized) and the effects of the abnormal discharge (see Table 8.1).",

      "title": "ECT: An Effective Treatment in the Screaming Demented Patient",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—As a tertiary inpatient geriatric psychiatry program, we are often exposed to a common treatment dilemma, the screaming demented patient. Very little has been published in this area. The studies reporting on agitation are mostly medical descriptions and pharmacologic trials, with verbal agitation being included under the broader symptom cluster of physical or behavioral agitation.1,2 Agitation is usually poorly defined, and in no studies was verbal agitation considered as a separate variable. As a whole, the medication trials achieved only limited degrees of success. Experience dictates that these successes are often more than offset by medication side-effects and drug toxicity, thus further complicating the patient's presentation and course.3 Partly owing to this lack of effective treatment, Fogel4 suggested the need for further investigation of ECT in the screaming demented patient. Verbal agitation (needless, unstimulated screaming, yelling, moaning) occurs in many psychiatric conditions common to the elderly—delirium, dementia and depression. It is unclear whether this is the result of a common final neurochemical pathway or of differing etiologies in the different conditions.5 We wish to report on a small series of three elderly, verbally agitated patients who showed a dramatic improvement in this symptom with bilateral ECT. In none of these patients was ECT the initial treatment modality employed; neuroleptics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines were tried unsuccsssfully first. One patient clearly met the criteria for major depression and had a past history of ECT-responsive mood disorder. In the other two patients, there was no clear history of major depression either past or current; both had a substantial degree of cognitive impairment. All three patients, exhibited rapid resolution of their screaming behaviour early in their course of ECT. These pilot results suggest some interesting directions. Assuming response to ECT, this might support the hypothesis that screaming in dementia may be a presentation of depression where the other symptoms may be difficult to elicit. On the other hand, the response may suggest a specific response to electrotherapy. Irrespective of the mechanism, ECT appears to provide the possibility of effective therapy in the demented patient who screams and could provide an alternative to the more traditional approach of endless trials of progressively more toxic psychotropic drugs, singly and in combination, with poor outcome and potentially devastating toxicity.",

The pain is excruciatingly severe, unilateral (always on the same side), unaccompanied by visual phenomena, nausea/vomiting, hut accompanied by nasal congestien and lacrimation on the symptomatic side. The maximum pain is felt in the temporal region, although during severe attacks the entire hemicranium is involved through the neck, shoulder and homolateral arm in a diffuse way. The attack pattern differs clearly from that of cluster headache both with regard to attack frequency and the long term temporal pattern. In addition to blood and urine parameters and supplementary neurological/neuroradiological investigations, the following parameters were studied: Urinary histamine excretion (partly increased), kinin parameters (occasionally increased blood kinin and reduced blood kininogen), and corneal indentation pulse amplitudes (attack-induced increase, as in regular cluster headache). The following parameters rendered normal results: prostaglandins, cerebral blood flow, fluorescein appearance time, intrathecal pressure during and between attacks, and muscle biopsy with immunological investigation. The pain attacks can be abolished by continuous indomethacin medication. In spite of the ocular findings i t has in common with cluster headache, this headache seems to differ from cluster headache.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "CLINICAL APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Resistance of seizures to anti‐epileptic therapy may be due to patient error, or to physician diagnostic and/or treatment error, rather than being truly intractable epilepsy. Increased drug dosage, irrespective of blood levels, a change of drug, or the addition of a second drug, are variously indicated in truly resistant cases. The use of more than two drugs is better avoided, and in some cases reduction of treatment may improve seizure control while lessening side‐effects. Repeated assessment of patients with refractory epilepsy is important, as causative or provocative factors may remain latent for long periods. Surgical therapy probably should be used more often and earlier than it now is for epilepsies that are medically intractable. RÉSUMÉ Approche clinique de la prise en charge de I'épilepsie irréductible La résistance des crises au traitement épileptique peut étre dûe à des erreurs du patient (style de vie désordonné, manque de compliànce) ou à des erreurs des médecins dans le diagnostic ou le traitement plutol que de traduire une véritable épilepsie irréductible. Un accroissement des doses de médicament, négligeant les taux sériques, une modification de médication ou l'addition d'un second médicament sont indiqués de façon variable dans les cas authentiquement résistants. II est préférable d'éviter l'emploi de plus de deux médicaments et dans quelques cas, une réduction des doses de médication peut améliorer le contrôle des crises tout en atténuant les effets secondaires. Une évaluation répétée des patients avec épilepsie irréductible est importante, les facteurs étiologiques et favorisants pouvant rester latents durant de longues périodes. La chirurgie devrait probablement être utilisée plus souvent et plus précocément qu'actuellement pour les patients dont I'épilepsie est médicalement irréductible. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Ein klinischer Vorstoβ in der Behandlung den unbeein fluβbaren Epilepsie Die Therapieresistenz von Krampfänfallen auf Antiepileptika ist eher durch Fehler des Patienten (unausgeglichener Lebensstil, fehlende Compliance) oder durch Fehler in der Diagnose oder Therapie des Arztes bedingt, als daß es sich wirklich um eine unbeeinflußbare Epilepsie handelt. Bei wirklich resistenten Fällen ist eine Erhöhung der Dosis ohne Rücksicht auf die Blutspiegel, ein Wechsel des Medikamentes oder die Zugabe eines zweiten Präparates wahlweise indiziert. Die Gabe von mehr als zwei Medikamenten sollte besser vermieden werden und in einigen Fällen können reduzierte Medikamentenspiegel die Krampfkontrolle verbessern und gleichzeitig Nebenwirkungen verhindern. Patienten mit unbeeinflußbarer Epilepsie müssen häufig kontrolliert werden, da kausale und provokative Faktoren über lange Zeit verborgen bleiben können. Patienten mitmedikamentös unbeeinflußbarer Epilepsie sollten häufiger und früher operativ behandelt werden, als es zur Zeit geschieht. RESUMEN Aproximación clínica al tratamiento de la epilepsia intratable La resistencia de las crisis a la terapéutica antiepiléptica puede deberse a un fallo en el paciente (tipo de vida errático falta de complianza) o a errores del médico en el diagnóstico o el tratamiento, más bien que se trate realmente de una epilepsia intratable. El aumento en la dosificación del fármaco, independientemente de los dosajes en sangre, un cambio en la medicación o la adición de un segundo fármaco es lo que suele indicarse en los casos verdaderamente resistentes. Es mejor evitar el uso de dos fármacos y en ocasiones la reductión de los niveles de fármaco puede mejorar el control de las crisis disminuyéndose los efectos secundarios. La evaluación repetida de los pacientes con epilepsias intratables es importante, puesto que los factores causales y los desencadenantes pueden permanecer latentes durante mucho tiempo. Es probable que la cirugía debiera usarse con mayor frecuencia y más tempranamente de lo que lo es ahora en los pacientes cuya epilepsia es médicamente intratable.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

While a person who was intoxicated may not be able to form the requisite specific intent to commit some offences, voluntary intoxication usually disentitles a person from an insanity or \"mental impairment\" defence. However, a person may also consume alcohol or use a substance without becoming intoxicated and the presence of alcohol, substances or metabolites of substances in a person's urine or blood is not conclusive when the question of intoxication is relevant. A jury (or a judge sitting without a jury) may require expert opinion evidence when cannabis or methamphetamine intoxication are implicated in the alleged offending.",

      "abstract": "To minimize the symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation, gradual tapering is necessary for all serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) except fluoxetine, which has an extended half-life. Agents with shorter half-lives such as venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine should be tapered gradually. Discontinuation symptoms, which frequently emerge after abrupt discontinuation or intermittent non-compliance and, less frequently, during dose reduction, are generally mild, short-lived, and self-limiting but can be distressing and may lead to missed work days and decreased productivity. The symptoms may be somatic (e.g., dizziness and light-headedness; nausea and vomiting; fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, chills, and other flu-like symptoms; sensory and sleep disturbances) or psychological (anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, irritability). Mild symptoms can often be treated by simply reassuring the patient that they are usually transient, but for more severe symptoms, it may be necessary to reinstitute the dosage of the original antidepressant and slow the rate of taper. Symptoms of discontinuation may be mistaken for physical illness or relapse into depression; misdiagnosing the symptoms may lead to unnecessary, costly tests and treatment. Thus, health care professionals need to be educated about the potential adverse effects of SRI discontinuation.",

There is a multidirectional continuum of anesthetic states—some represented by CNS excitation and others by depression. 2. The reticular activating system is influenced by all anesthetics; some inhibit its action (stage III) and some hyperexcite the system resulting in a function disorganization (stage II-C). 3. Some agents traverse both excitation and depression, diethyl ether (I, II, III). 4. Others induce only stage II—catalepsia, e.g. nitrous oxide, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-chloralose, phencyclidine, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 5. Others induce no stage II but progress directly from stage I stage III, e.g. halothane and barbiturates. 6. Cataleptic agents may induce further CNS excitation manifested by seizures, e.g. gamma-hydroxybutyrate, phencyclidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 7. The functional definition of surgical anesthesia is: a stage induced by a drug that makes the subject relatively unresponsive to painful stimuli and amnestic. Thus, the subject does not respond during surgery and cannot recall what happened afterwards. This state can be achieved by functional disruption of CNS systems by marked stimulation or depression.",

Ecstasy has now reached the illegal drug market in Denmark via the US, Great Britain and Sweden. The drug is related to a certain youth culture from which it is estimated that many drug abusers have been recruited. The desired effects of ecstasy, namely enhanced openness, awareness and empathy, have previously been used in various therapeutic connections. In later years the drug has led to abuse which, in connection with certain cultural behaviour patterns (for example in discotheques), can cause dangerous psychiatric as well as somatic effects. The undesirable psychiatric effects range from fear through depression to actual psychoses, and the somatic effects vary from symptoms of increased sympathetic activity to malignant hyperthermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and lethal hepatotoxicity. The last mentioned symptoms occur in connection with prolonged physical activities such as exhausting dancing sessions. The article discusses the available treatments for conditions of abuse and stresses the need for prophylactic efforts in the form of information and awareness of the problem.",

Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4.

These are considered under one of two headings: (1) centrally acting, having either inhibitory action leading to diminished motor activity or facilitating action leading to increased or even uncontrolled motor activity; (2) locally acting, affecting peripheral structures. Most of the widely used muscle relaxants are of the former type, with the major effect being on polysynaptic pathways, e.g., meprobamate, carisoprodol, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam. The advantages, limitations, and disadvantages of each are discussed. Drowsiness is a common drawback. Of these drugs, diazepam is cited as relieving muscle spasm associated with cerebral palsy and athetosis. The locally acting agents, e.g., procaine, Xylocaine, as well as toxins (diphtheria, botulism, and puffer toxin), act by interfering with nerve conduction, the release, destruction, and attachment to receptors of acetylcholine, by electrolyte alteration, and by direct action on the myofibrils, having little merit clinically. Despite the development of many centrally acting agents, a really effective and satisfactory muscle relaxant must still be sought.",

More commonly, mild asymptomatic elevations in liver function tests are seen and these are not predictive of progression to more severe liver injury. Laboratory monitoring of liver function before and during treatment is recommended with the use of valproic acid and carbamazepine, but not for other psychotropic drugs, although regular laboratory testing is not a reliable method for detecting or preventing severe liver injury. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity or hypersensitivity reactions that affect the liver is more important.

Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the cornerstones of drug therapy. Venlafaxine, a phenylethylamine antidepressant that primarily inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, is an alternative to those agents. It has been studied in short‐term and continuation studies and appears to have efficacy similar to that of imipramine, trazodone, and fluoxetine. Moreover, venlafaxine is effective in approximately one‐third of patients with treatment‐resistant depression. Venlafaxine is metabolized by the P‐450 enzyme system to an active metabolite O ‐desmethyl‐venlafaxine, which is excreted renally. Nausea, somnolence, and dizziness are dose‐related adverse effects that often occur with initiation of therapy. Increases in blood pressure, particularly with high dosages, also may occur. Drug‐drug interactions appear to be minimal.",

An increased mortality rate in the postoperative period for schizophrenic patients receiving chronic antipsychotic therapy has been demonstrated. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disease, schizophrenia-associated psychotic disorders are characterized by disturbances in emotional, behavioral and cognitive arenas, impeding on nearly every aspect of life functioning in the form of thought disorders, delusions and hallucinations. Chronic schizophrenic patients lack pain sensitivity, and have pituitary-adrenal and autonomic nerve dysfunction, abnormalities of the immune system, and water intoxication. These alterations may influence postoperative outcome. Psychotropic drugs often given in combination with each other or with other non-psychiatric drugs generally exert profound effects on the central and peripheral neurotransmitter and ionic mechanisms. The increased complications are associated with physical disorders, antipsychotic or hazardous health behaviour and interactions between antipsychotics and anaesthetic drugs. Adverse responses during anaesthesia include arrhythmias, hypotension, prolonged narcosis or coma, hyperpyrexia, post-operative ileus and post-operative confusion. Although drug interaction probably remains the most potentially serious problem current evidence suggests that psychiatric medication need not be discontinued prior to anesthesia.",

The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia remains uncertain but is believed to be partly the result of central systems affecting afferent processing as well as impaired endogenous pain-inhibitory systems. Abnormal central nociceptive processing may contribute to fibromyalgia, producing heightened responses to various noxious stimuli with resulting mechanical hyperalgesia. Fibromyalgia remains a clinical diagnosis. There has been a recent paradigm shift away from requiring 11 or more out of 18 tender points and instead focusing on the presence of chronic widespread pain as well as symptoms of fatigue, unrefreshed sleep, and other somatic complaints. Although there is no known cure for fibromyalgia, multidisciplinary team efforts using combined treatment approaches, including patient education, aerobic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic therapies (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [eg, duloxetine, milnacipran] and alpha 2-delta receptor ligands [eg, pregabalin]) may improve symptoms as well as function of patients with fibromyalgia.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Five epileptic patients who experienced vertiginous or showed rotatory phenomena during epileptic attacks were described. Peripheral vestibular stimulation was used as an activating EEG procedure. The observations described here, supported by data from the literature, led the author to the following conclusions: Different abnormal EEG patterns, focal or generalized, besides temporal foci, may be found in connection with vertiginous and other epileptic manifestations of vestibular dysfunction. In the observed cases with vertiginous and gyratory epileptic attacks no other EEG responses to the stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canals were séen, than otherwise occasionally observed in epileptic patients. The term “vestibulogenic seizures” therefore should be used with caution only in the sense of a reflex induction of an epileptic phenomenon. RÉSUMÉ Cinq malades épileptiques qui présentaient des sensations vertigineuses ou des mouvements giratoires pendant leurs crises ont subi une “activation” par la stimulation vestibulaire périphérique. Les resultats obtenus s'accordent avec ceux de la litterature et permettent les conclusions suivantes: Différentes anomalies EEGraphiques, focalisées ou généralisées, peuvent être rencontrées en dehors des foyers temporaux chez ces malades. La stimulation des canaux semi‐circulaires horizontaux ne provoque chez ces malades aucune autre réponse EEGraphique que celle qui est provoquée de temps en temps chez d'autres malades épileptiques. Le terme de “crise vestibulogène” ne peut done être utilisé avec précaution que dans le but de désigner la production réflexe d'un phénomène épileptique.",

To our knowledge, we describe the first reported case of isolated paresthesia and peripheral neuropathy, without systemic involvement, secondary to sulindac administration. A healthy, 30-year-old man, exposed to sulindac on two separate occasions, had an incapacitating isolated idential sensory neuropathy. The onset and duration of symptoms correlated directly to drug ingestion. This hypersensitivity response cannot be explained pathophysiologically by any mechanism. Repeated exposure and rechallenge of the subject to sulindac was deemed too dangerous, and precludes exact method to establish mechanisms to explain this transient, reproducible, idiosyncratic, adverse drug reaction.

If agitation persists and patients have contraindications for these substances, then anesthetics, such as propofol, can also be used as well, to serve as a sedative. Our attention was drawn to a particular case in which dexmedetomidine was used as a sedative.<br/> AIM: To study the literature on the use of α2-agonists, such as dexmedetomidine, in the treatment of extreme agitation.<br/> METHOD: We reviewed the relevant scientific literature.<br/> RESULTS: α2-agonists, such as dexmedetomidine, are new anesthetic agents that have analgetic and sympatholytic effects without suppressing respiration. These agents are used frequently in intensive care because their sedative effect are short-lived and do not cause amnesia, sleep deprivation or cognitive disturbance. Excited delirium syndrome (eds) is a type of extreme agitation for which dexmedetomidine can be used.<br/> CONCLUSION: There may well be a place for dexmedetomidine in the treatment of extreme agitation when standard treatments have failed. Further research is needed in order to ascertain whether dexmedetomidine should play a role in such treatment.",

Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation. La réaction typique est la suivante: une fois la blessure infligée, et après une période de dépersonnalisation suivit de détente et de repersonnalisation provoquée par le saignement, le patient n'éprouve aucune douleur.",

The pattern of an anaphylactic reaction can be uniphasic (or monophasic), biphasic (also called delayed or late phase), or refractory in nature. The most widely cited definition of biphasic anaphylaxis is a recurrence of anaphylactic symptoms after initial resolution despite no further exposure to the trigger. Corticosteroids are thought by some to prevent the development of biphasic symptoms and, therefore, commonly used in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis but this has not been systemtically analyzed. In this review, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for articles using “anaphylaxis” combined with the key terms “biphasic” and/or “corticosteroids” and/or “epinephrine.” A total of 31 appropriate studies were identified. Biphasic anaphylactic reactions are more likely to occur in moderate to severe anaphylaxis or when anaphylaxis is not treated with timely epinephrine. Because of the potential detrimental adverse effects of corticosteroids and lack of compelling evidence demonstrating an effective role in reducing anaphylaxis severity or preventing biphasic anaphylaxis, we do not advocate for their routine use in anaphylaxis.",

We report eight patients with severe pain, three of whom suffered from new onset oncologic metastatic bone pain, others had previous pain syndromes and presented with exacerbation of pain. Pain was associated with hyperalgesia and allodynia phenomena in two patients and with phantom pain in a third one. Tolerance to opioids had developed, and high IV doses of morphine, meperidine or fentanyl, and patient-controlled intravenous and epidural analgesia were insufficient. Several patients became dependent on opioids and could not be weaned from assisted ventilation.Pain was controlled with decreasing adjunct doses of ketamine. Within 5-10 days of ketamine and opioid protocols, pain was controlled and after an additional 5-7 days, ketamine could be stopped and pain controlled on oral regimens compatible with outpatient care.Ketamine is an efficient adjuvant analgesic for intractable severe pain, caused by metastasis, trauma, chronic ischemia, or central neuropathic pain. It is effective even when mega doses of IV, epidural, or oral opioids prove ineffective and when signs of tolerance have developed.",

They are also direct‐ or indirect‐acting 5‐HT1A receptor partial agonists. These features contribute to their low extrapyramidal adverse effects as well as their ability to improve cognition (perhaps via enhanced cortical and hippocampal DA release). Aripiprazole and bifeprunox are D2 partial agonists rather than D2 receptor antagonists. Some of these agents also act on multiple other receptors which may relate to efficacy (e.g., 5‐HT2C receptor inverse agonists, M1 muscarinic agonists, alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonists) or side effects (e.g., H1 receptor antagonism), or both. Thus, D2 receptor blockade is no longer the exclusive means to treat psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Emergence delirium in children is still considered as a mysterious complication occurring after pediatric anesthesia. Although the pharmacology of fast-acting volatile agent is highly suspected in the genesis of this complication, no strong evidence has been published to support this hypothesis. This review summarizes the recent findings concerning this complication.Emergence delirium occurs typically in preschool children, with a high intensity of anxiety, after sevoflurane or desflurane anesthesia. In addition, although pain has been suspected in the genesis of this complication, emergence delirium has also been described after nonpainful procedure (imaging). Prevention of this complication relies on preventing preoperative anxiety (using premedication and psychological approaches), providing a sufficient analgesia (either systemically or by regional analgesia) and administering intraoperative sedative agents such as ketamine, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, gabapentine, midazolam, magnesium, hydroxyzine, midazolam and dexamethasone. Treatment of emergence delirium should be pharmacological when facing intense agitation with self-injury risks. This could be achieved using propofol, opioid agents or dexmedetomidine. As a result of the delayed discharge from a postoperative care unit associated with these agents, dexmedetomidine should be favored because of its analgesic and postoperative nausea and vomiting preventive effects. As emergence delirium shares many risk factors with long-lasting cognitive complications such as postoperative maladaptative behavioral changes, letting parents know about these complications is requested.Emergence delirium in children is a frequent but preventable complication. Strategies for prevention and therapy include particularly pain management and medication with alpha-2 agonists.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fragile X‐associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder with core features of action tremor and cerebellar gait ataxia. Frequent associated findings include parkinsonism, executive function deficits and dementia, neuropathy, and dysautonomia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in FXTAS demonstrate increased T2 signal intensity in the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign) in the majority of patients. Similar signal alterations are seen in deep and subependymal cerebral white matter, as is general cortical and subcortical atrophy. The major neuropathological feature of FXTAS is the presence of intranuclear, neuronal, and astrocytic, inclusions in broad distribution throughout the brain and brainstem. FXTAS is caused by moderate expansions (55–200 repeats; premutation range) of a CGG trinucleotide in the fragile X mental retardation 1 ( FMR1 ) gene, the same gene which causes fragile X syndrome when in the full mutation range (200 or greater CGG repeats). The pathogenic mechanism is related to overexpression and toxicity of the FMR1 mRNA per se. Although only recently discovered, and hence currently under‐diagnosed, FXTAS is likely to be one of the most common single‐gene disorders leading to neurodegeneration in males. In this report, we review information available on the clinical, radiological, and pathological features, and prevalence and management of FXTAS. We also provide guidelines for the practitioner to assist with identifying appropriate patients for DNA testing for FXTAS, as well as recommendations for genetic counseling once a diagnosis of FXTAS is made. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society",

However, one of the hallmark features of hallucinogens or psychedelic agents is their ability to induce states of altered or distorted perception, thought, and mood. Many hallucinogens produce classic sympathomimetic effects; that is, hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. However, the effects vary considerably, depending upon the hallucinogen ingested. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is suffering from hallucinogen intoxication such as marijuana use can be helpful to the clinician. However, the common toxicologic drug screens used by most clinical laboratories do not detect many hallucinogenic agents (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide]). Thus, diagnosis of hallucinogen ingestion and treatment is often based on history of use and physical examination.",

      "title": "Finding Genes for Parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "The definition of dual tryptophan pathways has increased the understanding of the mind-body, body-mind dichotomy. The serotonergic pathway highlights the primary (endogenous) psychiatric disorders. The up-regulation of the kynurenine pathway by physical illnesses can cause neuropathic and immunological disorders1 associated with secondary neuropsychiatric symptoms. Tryptophan and nicotinamide deficiencies fall within the protein energy malnutrition (PEM) spectrum. They can arise if the kynurenine pathway is stressed by primary or secondary inflammatory conditions and the consequent imbalance of available catabolic/anabolic substrates may adversely influence convalescent phase efficiency. The replacement of depleted or reduced NAD+ levels and other cofactors can perhaps improve the clinical management of these disorders. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM) appear to meet the criteria of a tryptophan-kynurenine pathway disorder with potential neuroimmunological sequelae. Aspects of some of the putative precipitating factors have been previously outlined.2,3 An analysis of the areas of metabolic dysfunction will focus on future directions for research and management.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

      "abstract": "The introduction of effective antipsychotic drugs in the early 1950s produced a revolution in the care of acute and chronic psychoses (Delay et al., 1952). Many patients with schizophrenia who previously would have been confined to mental hospitals for life were able to lead almost normal lives in the community, their psychotic symptoms being adequately controlled. This pharmacological miracle was not without its drawbacks. It soon became apparent that these drugs were not only attended by the usually recognized side effects such as cholestatic jaundice, but also had remarkable effect on the control of movement, i.e., on the extrapyramidal system. The first problem to be noted in this regard was drug-induced parkinsonism (Steck, 1954). Early on in their use it was felt that a drug's antipsychotic action paralleled its ability to produce parkinsonism. The impassive facies, flexed posture, and other parkinsonian features soon became a commonplace finding in mental institutions. Initially, this did not cause undue concern as it was felt that this was a small price to pay for control of mentally disturbed patients.",

      "title": "Antidepressants for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Tricyclic antidepressants have been the mainstay treatment modality of neuropathic pain. However, use of these agents has been limited by their significant side effects and potential cardiac adverse events, particularly in overdose. Newer antidepressants have been shown to have better safety profiles and tolerability. This article examines current evidence of the use of newer antidepressants in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The proposed mechanisms of action, clinical evidence and tolerability were reviewed. Although tricyclic antidepressants appear to be the most efficacious agents for neuropathic pain, there is inadequate evidence supporting their prolonged use. Paroxetine, trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine are potentially useful agents, but these drugs can also produce treatment-limiting side effects. Key words: Antidepressive agents, Diabetic neuropathies, Neuralgia Introduction Neuropathic pain is the pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. (1,2) The possible aetiologies could be central in cases of stroke, multiple sclerosis, or epilepsy, or peripheral in conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and traumatic nerve injury. (2,3) There is no pathognomonic description for neuropathic pain in the literature, but the combination of burning or electrical pain with numbness and tingling, as well as pins and needles are thought to be highly indicative. (2) Since this pain is usually chronic and responds poorly to analgesics, many non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments have been proposed. For example, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) had been shown to be effective in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. (4) A large variety of pharmacological agents, topical or oral, are also being used. These include antidepressants (especially the tricyclic antidepressants; TCAs), anticonvulsants, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-B receptor agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, opioids, levodopa and topical capsaicin creams. According to the systematic review by Sindrup and Jensen, TCAs are the most efficacious agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain. (5) While newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and venlafaxine share some similar pharmacodynamic properties with TCAs, the former may be potentially useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain, especially for patients with comorbid depression and suicide risk. Newer antidepressants have additional benefits--they are better tolerated and safer in overdose. (6) While the side effects of TCAs may limit the achievement of optimal dose, this problem is less likely with newer antidepressants. In this review, the current evidence for possible underlying mechanisms and side effect profiles of antidepressants commonly used in the treatment of neuropathic pain are examined. Tricyclic Antidepressants The efficacy of TCAs in the treatment of depression was originally reported by Kuhn in 1958. (7) Thereafter, TCAs came to be considered the mainstay treatment for depression. Although monoamine reuptake blockade properties seem to be the important initial mediator for their antidepressant action, the main mechanism is thought to be a delayed adaptive downregulation of postsynaptic receptors. (8) The use of TCAs in the treatment of neuropathic pain can be dated back to a report by Woodforde et al of treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in 1965. (9) However, early studies of tricyclic antidepressants were complicated by the concomitant use of other drugs. (10) In 1982, Watson et al reported one of the earliest randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trials studying the effects of amitriptyline in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. (10) The study recruited 24 patients and employed a treatment duration of 3 weeks. The effects on depression, sleep, and untoward reactions were monitored. …",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by complex motor and nonmotor symptoms. The clinical diagnosis of PD is defined by bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, although several nonmotor symptoms are also related to disability, an impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy. Levodopa, which is used as a standard pharmacotherapy for PD, has limitations including a short half‐life, fluctuations in efficacy, and dyskinesias with long‐term use. There have been efforts to develop complementary and alternative therapies for incurable PD. Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional herbal medicine that is widely used for treating neurosis, insomnia, and night crying in children. The clinical efficacy of YKS for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and impaired agitation/aggression subscale and activities of daily living scores, has mainly been investigated in the context of neurological disorders such as PD, Alzheimer’s disease, and other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, YKS has previously been found to improve clinical symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments, pain, and tardive dyskinesia. Preclinical studies have reported that the broad efficacy of YKS for various symptoms involves its regulation of neurotransmitters including GABA, serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine, as well as the expression of dynamin and glutamate transporters, and changes in glucocorticoid hormones and enzymes such as choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, YKS has neuroprotective effects at various cellular levels via diverse mechanisms. In this review, we focus on the clinical efficacy and neuropharmacological effects of YKS. We discuss the possible mechanisms underpinning the effects of YKS on neuropathology and suggest that the multiple actions of YKS may be beneficial as a treatment for PD. We highlight the potential that YKS may serve as a complementary and alternative strategy for the treatment of PD.",

      "title": "The effect of nasal introduction of anaesthetic in adults undergoing Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES): A systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The primary objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesise the best available evidence on the effect of anaesthetic on the physiological aspects of swallowing (rate, strength, and risk of laryngeal penetration or aspiration) as well as client pain and/or discomfort in adults undergoing Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). This procedure is also described as Fibreoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory testing (FEESS or FEESST) and Videoendoscopic Evaluation of Dysphagia (VEED). Background Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing disorder. Aetiologies include medical (respiratory illness, medications, general deterioration), neurological or neuromuscular (cerebrovascular accident [CVA], dementia, progressive disease such as Motor Neurone Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease), congenital (cerebral palsy, cleft palate, intellectual disability), traumatic (brain injury, structural change, damage or cancer surgery, radiation therapy), psychiatric, psychological, functional (no known aetiology) and oesophageal structural deformities. 1 Oropharyngeal dysphagia may be described as a ‘sensation that solids or liquids are not being swallowed correctly’. 1(p. 339) Patients may also have symptoms such as coughing, choking, or a feeling of material still in their throat. Impaired swallowing is a problem because it may lead to significant medical conditions such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, and weight loss. 2 The FEES is a procedure which allows visualisation of the anatomical structures involved in swallowing. This technique allows assessment of swallow competency, diagnosis of pharyngeal dysphagia, and laryngeal penetration of food or fluids. 3-5 FEES gives a ‘real time’ evaluation, and allows for trialling techniques and modifications of food and fluids to determine therapy strategies for safe swallowing that work for that particular client. It does not expose the client to ionising radiation associated with Modified Barium Swallow (MBS) and provides immediate information about the efficiency of the protective cough reflex. 1, 4-6 The FEES procedure is typically undertaken by speech pathologists and otolaryngologists (Ear Nose and Throat specialists) to evaluate and diagnose swallowing disorders/competence. It involves the transnasal introduction of a flexible nasendoscope through the nose and into the hypopharynx. Food or fluid is then introduced orally and the pharyngeal phase of swallowing process observed. 6 The FEES procedure is an assessment tool designed to aid patients with swallowing difficulties. Figure 1 (adapted from 7) presents a schematic diagram of the flexible nasendoscope placement during the FEES procedure.Figure 1: Illustration of laryngoscope placement during the FEES procedure, adapted from 7During FEES swallowing function is evaluated using anatomical and functional criteria. Food and/or fluid are introduced and there is an evaluation of any premature spillage of the bolus into the pharynx or larynx, whether there is a risk of penetration or aspiration of the bolus before the swallow is triggered. Once the swallow has been completed, evidence of residue within the hypopharynx, or around it, suggests laryngeal or pharyngeal weakness. Evidence of bolus in the trachea is an indication of aspiration. Multiple swallows for each bolus may indicate weakness of the tongue base or posterior pharyngeal wall. 1, 8, 9 FEES allows a physical examination of structural movements during a swallow of different foods and liquids. Interventions, which commonly include dietary and/or behavioural modifications, are prescribed to lessen swallowing difficulty if swallow impairment is diagnosed. 9 A ‘competent’ swallow is commonly defined as timely (less than three seconds after oral preparation of the bolus), complete such that the whole bolus is swallowed without pharyngeal residue, and propulsion to the oesophagus occurs, with no penetration or aspiration into the larynx. A ‘competent’ swallow is not effortful and does not generally require double or multiple swallows.8 An accurate result of the swallow evaluation is critical as it facilitates appropriate patient referral and treatment, outcomes that can significantly affect quality of life 9 and health 3. For many years dysphagia assessment and management was conducted using clinical (bedside) assessment, or videofluoroscopic studies (MBS).10 Bedside assessment involves a trial of food and fluids, and an oro-motor examination. The result of a bedside assessment is reliant on the clinician's ability to detect, and evaluate oral and pharyngeal dysphagia and gain knowledge of oesophageal symptoms based on the patient's medical history. When the FEES swallow evaluation procedure is used, there is a visual assessment of what is actually happening which is not possible in the bedside assessment. Calculated evaluations can be made using results from the bedside approach, but a clear diagnosis is often difficult, 11 and even the most experienced clinicians can fail during a bedside examination to identify approximately 40% of aspirating patients. 11Clinical evaluation has its place, however it is problematic in that silent aspiration (i.e. no overt evidence such as coughing or choking when food or fluids enter below the vocal cords) is not detected.4 Scott et al 12 have pointed out that swallowing is a complex activity involving several rapid, integrated movements, few of which could be observed directly which makes evaluating it complex. In addition, a cough can be an unreliable indicator of aspiration.13 Whilst reasonable conclusions can be made with clinical evaluation, there is the danger of inaccurate diagnosis and inappropriate recommendations leading to negative impacts on patient health outcomes and quality of life 3. Videofluoroscopic studies, such as the MBS, have been used for diagnosis and evaluation of dysphagia since the 1980's. 8 This procedure evaluates the oral phase, pharyngeal phase and the oesophageal transit. Small amounts of food and liquid (with barium paste) are introduced and followed radiographically from mouth to the lower oesophageal sphincter. This procedure is carried out in a radiology suite, with a radiologist and radiology technician present, and generally a speech pathologist. It requires the patient to be able to sit upright. At times this precludes very ill patients and those who find the physical demands of the procedure too difficult. 8 The FEES procedure was formalised by Susan E Langmore in the late 1980's. Its introduction was a “collaborative effort” 8(p. 1386) between the specialties of speech pathology and otolaryngology. Prior to this development, otolaryngologists had largely screened patients and diagnosed swallowing disorders 8. Langmore identified the clinical usefulness of FEES for analysis of function as compared with medical pathology which would only allow assessment of anatomical not functional pathologies. The advantages of FEES over MBS include its portability and easy access for physically disadvantaged patients, the lack of need for a radiology suite (and radiologist), its relative cost-effectiveness, no radiation exposure (and therefore any amount of time can be used to determine a diagnosis), the ability to directly visualise and record the pharynx and larynx, and its sensitivity in detection of and severity rating of aspiration. 3, 5, 6, 14 FEES is the evaluation of choice where a patient is compromised by radiation necessary for the MBS, and especially where repetitive examinations are required, for example for biofeedback. During FEES the food and fluid is dyed with colour to enhance visibility. At times, the end of the scope can become covered with oropharyngeal secretions or food or fluid, although this can be easily cleared by an experienced endoscopist using techniques to slightly change the position of the scope to clear the residue. In addition, during swallowing the endoscope will be momentarily pushed against the posterior pharyngeal wall, causing ‘white-out’ (this occurs for about half a second). 11 Some clinicians may consider this a disadvantage of FEES, as visual recording, or observation, is briefly lost. The risk of complications with FEES is regarded as low, but may include: a reaction to the anaesthetic, laryngospasm, epistaxis (nosebleeds), fainting, laryngospasm. 9 Hence, the availability of medical response if required is necessary when performing a FEES. Swallowing function includes three main phases, namely the oral, pharyngeal and oesophageal phase. Dysphagia may occur in any one of these phases 1 and in individuals of any age.14 FEES effectively evaluates the pharyngeal phase and any laryngeal penetration and aspiration (liquid or food going into the ‘wind pipe’).1, 6, 8, 11 However, it is unable to evaluate either the oral or oesophageal swallow phases as the scope is passed through the nasopharynx (nose and back of the throat). FEES is effective at identifying silent aspiration 3, which may be defined as entry of the bolus below the level of the true vocal folds without any external behavioural signs such as coughing or choking. 4 Speech pathologists have specific training to make recommendations about a safe diet and fluid consistency for a dysphagic client to swallow. Based on the outcomes of the FEES procedure, they can be more certain of the efficacy of their recommendations. The recommended foods and fluids may need to be modified in consistency depending on the evaluation of dysphagia, thereby affecting quality of life of the client. FEES is important in that it facilitates a more precise determination of the food and fluids safe for swallowing as the procedure allows visualisation of the client swallowing those actual consistencies.3, 15, 16 This is why it is important to understand whether the use of anaesthetic during FEES affects the accuracy of the swallow function diagnosis. During FEES the thin flexible nasendoscope is introduced into the client's nose and then passed through to the back of the throat (Figure 1). For accurate placement and prevention of tissue damage, the client is advised to stay still. Anaesthetic is commonly introduced as a means to reduce client anxiety, pain and discomfort and minimise client movement during the procedure. The most common form of anaesthetic introduction is via the application of a topical or spray anaesthetic into the nostril prior to the introduction of the nasendoscope. 1, 10, 15, 17 The use of anaesthetic during the FEES procedure is a topic of debate both in the literature and practice relating to diagnosing and treating swallow function. 2, 18, 19 In practice, otolaryngologists frequently use anaesthetic to evaluate structure whereas speech pathologists are not authorised to use anaesthetic and therefore require the presence of an Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist or other medically trained professional when it is being used. The tendency for FEES to be conducted with anaesthetic, and restrictions relating to which health professionals can administer anaesthetic during FEES limits access to FEES in facilities where there is unavailability of medical practitioners authorised to administer anaesthetic. As is explained in more detail below, the debate on the use of and need for anaesthetic when conducting FEES focuses on whether application of anaesthetic influences swallowing function and the accuracy of the diagnosis of dysphagia as well as anaesthetic's effectiveness for reducing client pain/discomfort and anxiety. The amount of anaesthetic, timing of anaesthetic, use of vasoconstrictor in addition to the anaesthetic and the method of application, have all been shown to vary across research studies and in clinical practice. Types and amounts of anaesthetic as described in the literature include Lidocaine 5, 20 20mg Cophenylcaine, 21 Cocaine, 22 2% Tetracaine.1, 17 Application methods also vary and include being applied nasally, orally, or with a cotton bud 23 or orviaaerosol puff.18 In addition, a vasoconstricting drug may also be applied in order to constrict the nasal mucosa and create a wider space to introduce the scope. 23 The sensation required for efficient swallowing is controlled by three cranial nerves innervating muscles of the mouth and pharynx. These nerves are the trigeminal, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. 2 The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve is regarded as the most important trigger for swallowing. Anaesthesia of areas innervated by these nerves can affect, but not completely diminish, the ability to swallow. This suggests that a person may have a less efficient swallow due to anaesthesia. 2, 7, 18, 19, 24. Aspiration with anaesthesia is described in the literature 18, suggesting increased risk during a FEES procedure if using anaesthetic. 2, 4, 7, 18, 19, 25 Therefore the clinician is potentially disadvantaged in their decision making. Another advantage of using anaesthetic during the FEES procedure, aside from its potential to reduce patient pain and discomfort raised in the debate over use of anaesthetic and FEES, is its potential to allow a more thorough assessment by the endoscopist because it is less distressing for the patient. However, some practitioners are of the view that the scope manoeuvres easily without anaesthetic. A disadvantage of using anaesthetic during FEES, raised both in discussions amongst those using the FEES procedure in practice in South Australia as well as in the literature 2, 20, is that it may cause a patient to experience a bitter taste. The client also has a ‘numb’ sensation for some time after application of the anaesthetic and is unable to drink or eat, because of the risk of aspiration, for around a half hour after the procedure. In the context of this debate over the use of anaesthetic when undertaking FEES it is important to conduct the systematic review proposed to enhance understanding about whether: (i) anaesthetic has a significant effect on the pain/comfort and anxiety experienced by the patient during the procedure; and/or (ii) it effects swallow function and swallow function diagnosis and thereby leads to an inappropriate management plan being recommended. No systematic review has been undertaken to date on the effects of anaesthetic during the FEES procedure. A preliminary search of the JBI Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library, PubMed and CINAHL found no systematic review protocols or reports on this topic. It is anticipated that the findings of this review will be used to enhance endoscopists’ decision making on the use of an anaesthetic agent when conducting FEES.",

The results show that an inflammation reaction does not significantly contribute to the origin. Furthermore, various preventive measures were studied to prevent muscular pain. There are various medicamental possibilities for efficiently preventing the muscular pain, among others by pre-treatment with certain painkillers, local anaesthetics and other muscle relaxants. Unfortunately, the pre-treatment appears not to be without risk for certain side-effects (for example pain during injection), which requires special attention from the practising doctor.",

Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis. Rarely, severe cases cause lifethreatening injuries. Risk of self-harm is increased by feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame and embarrassment.8 Studies further describe significant associations between ED and suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.",

      "title": "[Three cases of drug-induced akathisia due to antiemetics during cancer palliative care].",
      "abstract": "Three cases of drug-induced akathisia during palliative care in terminal cancer patients were reported. Antiemetics (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) possessing a central antidopaminergic effect were suspected to have caused the akathisia. Akathisia, as well as extrapyramidal symptoms, is a common and unpleasant complex neurobehavioral adverse effect of conventional antipsychotic drugs. But it is not widely recognized by general clinicians. This syndrome consists of subjective (feeling of inner restlessness, mental unease, or dysphoria and the urge to move) and objective components (restless movement, including rocking on one's feet, walking in position shuffling and tramping the legs,and crossing and uncrossing one's legs while sitting). In severe cases, patients constantly pace up and down in an attempt to relieve the sense of unrest. While the pathophysiology of drug-induced akathisia remains unknown, antagonism of the mesocortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways is a plausible if not completely satisfactory hypothesis. The notion that dopaminergic blockade underlies the emergence of akathisia is supported by the PET studies. Since akathisia is a drug-induced adverse effect, optimal management involves its prevention rather than treatment. Drugs which have been found to have some efficacy in the treatment of akathisia are anticholinergics, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines and clonidine. Though a number of other treatments have been proposed, no trial-based evidences for treatment of akathisia have been available. It is important that akathisia is recognized and treated appropriately as an adverse reaction to drugs and a further increase in antipsychotic medication dosage may further exacerbate the condition.",

      "abstract": "Flunitrazepam, widely known by its trade names (e.g. Rohypnol), may cause severe violence, especially in combination with alcohol. Flunitrazepam abusers become cold-blooded, ruthless and violent, and do not remember their violence. Reputedly it is supplied to professional hit-men and enforcers by their bosses to promote ruthless efficacy. One case report describes how a young man, intoxicated with flunitrazepam and involved in causing serious knife and gunshot wounds and taking hostages, felt so invincible that he openly challenged the police, threatening them with an assault rifle, but was himself shot. Flunitrazepam may exert pharmacological effects on GABA-ergic systems, thus lowering serotonin levels. The impulsive execution of violent crimes and suicide attempts in which a violent method (hanging, shooting, self-stabbing) has been used are associated with the presence of low serotonin levels. It is therefore recommended that flunitrazepam should be classified as a controlled substance in Sweden as it is elsewhere.",

Recent discoveries concerning the effects of ketamine and similar substances in the brain suggest that they may interfere with memory processes when given acutely and may affect synaptic plasticity when given chronically in high doses in certain animal models. It is thus of interest to examine the consequences, if any, of chronic use in humans. A case is here presented of long-term, high-dose ketamine use, in which the user described impaired recall and attention, and a subtle visual anomaly persisting after cessation of the habit.

There may be extreme negativism that is manifested by resistance to all instructions or the maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved. Additional features may include stereotypes, mannerisms, and automatic obedience or mimicry. 2 What follows is a case in which etomidate produced an unexpected arousal effect, rather than sedation, in a patient with catatonia caused by a high dose of steroids.",

General notes on Tinnitus: 1- Any Tinnitus treatment must be used in connection with counseling and possible other treatment. 2- Tinnitus is a perception of involuntary sound. It must be audible to the person, it originates in the head (McFadden 1982). 3- It is most commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. 4- Produced centrally, with peripheral influences (e.g. Cochlear damage). Exact mechanism(s), or epidemiology is unknown. 5- Noise type can vary from pure tones over modulated noise to crackling sounds that varies significantly with time &amp; Large intensity variations. 6- Not a ‘phantom’ perception for the patient, it is real 7- Tinnitus can be described in many different forms, for example: Ringing, Chirping, Clicking, Pulsating, Continuous, Sudden A-Geriatric tinnitus Presby tinnitus, defined as tinnitus that accompanies the progressive hearing loss of presbycusis; is classified as: type 1 (normal aging affecting the cochlea), and type II (preexistent sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by multiple systemic complaints, especially of sensory ones). B-Pediatric tinnitus has an incidence of 13% in children who passed an audio metric screening test, and 23-60% in those with hearing loss, 44% in secretory otitis media, but only 3% complain spontaneously because that the child considers tinnitus to be a normal event. There is no significant difference between children with tinnitus and those without in terms of hearing level, age, gender, or etiology of the deafness. Despite the fact that often children do not mention it, tinnitus may incite behavioral problems.",

The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, vasomotor collapse, and even death. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications.

      "title": "The Explosion of a New Designer Drug, Flakka",
      "abstract": "There are many challenges facing healthcare professionals. One such challenge is the continuous introduction of new synthetic drugs. Synthetic drugs pose many difficulties to providers, including identification of the drug ingested, management of symptoms, ensuring safety of the patient and his or her environment, and continual monitoring after the initial symptoms, because synthetic cathinones have many long-term effects on an individual. One such synthetic drug, flakka, is a potent second-generation synthetic cathinone. Because flakka inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, which are involved in one's perception of pleasure, it causes inflated feelings and also causes signs and symptoms of psychosis. Flakka also induces various exaggerated symptoms, such as feelings of incredible strength, disorientation, aggression, and altered thought processes, and also can cause hyperthermia, coma, and death. Healthcare professionals need to understand the nature of flakka ingestion, the various symptoms a user may exhibit, and the long-term symptoms a person may have once the acute recovery phase has ended. Once the initial phase of ingestion is over and the patient is medically stabilized, the patient may experience signs and symptoms of psychosis or other psychiatric disorders. It is paramount that healthcare professionals are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of flakka ingestion, know the steps to take to ensure safety of the patient and those around him or her, and also know how to facilitate the patient's recovery.",

      "title": "Panic Attacks in the Natural Environmet",
      "abstract": "Despite much recent research, there is still little systematic information about the phenomenology of panic attacks, and their possible causes remain obscure. We investigated panic attacks in the natural environment using an event sampling approach. Twenty-seven panic attack patients and 19 matched normal conrols kept panic attack and self-exposure diaries for 6 days and wore an ambulatory heart rate/physical activity recorder for 3 days. Patients reported 175 attacks, generally of moderate severity. The most frequent symptoms were palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, nausea, sweating, and chest pain/ discomfort. The results did not support the classification of panic attacks recently proposed by Sheehan and Sheehan, which requires three symptoms as a cutoff for panic attacks. Panic attacks classified by the patients as situational (i.e., occurring in feared situations) were more severe and occurred in situational contexts different from spontaneous attacks, but were otherwise phenomenologically similar. Heart rates did not change during spontaneous attacks and were only mildly elevated during situational attacks or during the 15 minutes preceding these attacks. These heart rate changes were interpretable as effects of anxiety, although physical activity showed a similar pattern of changes. Some normal control subjects reported on the panic diary primarily situational anxiety episodes that were phenomenologically similar to, albeit less severe than, the patients' episodes. Panic patients may sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many attacks classified as spontaneous occurred in classical \"phobic\" situations. Furthermore, the comparison of concurrent diary and retrospective interview and questionnaire descriptions showed that panic patients have a tendency toward retrospective exaggeration. Implications for the assessment, definition, and classification of panic attacks are discussed.",

Providing anesthesia for ECT is challenging, as the effect of drugs on hemodynamics, seizure duration, comfort, and recovery must be considered. We highlight and aim to review the common anesthetics used in ECT and related evidence. While drugs such as methohexital, succinylcholine, and etomidate have been used in the past, other drugs such as dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and remifentanil may provide a more balanced anesthetic with a greater safety profile in select populations. Overall, it is essential to consider the patient's co-morbidities and associated risks when deciding on an anesthetic drug.",

      "abstract": "The traditional stimulus-response model of physiologic pain is conceptually appealing and has laid the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of nociceptive pathways. However, physiologic pain alone is a rare entity in the clinical setting. In most situations, the noxious stimulus is not transient and may be associated with significant tissue inflammation and nerve injury. Under such circumstances, the classic “hard-wired” system becomes less relevant and dynamic changes in the processing of noxious input are evident in both peripheral and central nervous systems. This type of pain is called pathologic pain (because it implies that the tissue damage has already occurred) or clinical pain, as ongoing discomfort and abnormal sensitivity are features of the patient’s clinical symptomatology. Pathologic pain may manifest itself in several ways: spontaneous pain which may be dull, burning or stabbing (causalgia), exaggerated pain in response to a noxious stimulus (hyperalgesia), and pain produced by a stimulus which is not normally noxious (allodynia) (1). Pathologic pain may arise from injury to a variety of tissue types invoking distinct neural mechanisms, and it is often further classified into inflammatory pain (involving somatic or visceral structures) or neuropathic pain (involving lesions of the nervous system). In addition, it is useful to characterize clinical pain from a temporal perspective and make the distinction between recently occurring (acute) and long lasting (chronic) pain(1,2).",

Chlordiazepoxide and chlorpromazine are recommended as alternative agents in patients who fail to respond to methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine.

The authors review certain exogenous factors that seem capable of triggering attacks and/or increasing their frequency and intensity: self-administered pharmacologic agents (caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, over-the-counter cold preparations, cannabis, cocaine); habits (sleep deprivation, diet, exercise, relaxation, hyperventilation); and aspects of the environment (fluorescent lighting, life stressors). There may be a specificity to the action of some of these factors, because certain factors previously thought to trigger panic attacks (e.g., pain, hypoglycemia) have been proved not to have this effect. Although the clinical significance of many of the exogenous factors discussed still awaits empirical confirmation, attention to such factors during the initial evaluation of a patient with panic disorder may be helpful in formulating a successful treatment plan.",

      "abstract": "Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease that presents clinically as fluctuating weakness of one or more skeletal muscle groups. Weakness becomes more severe with exercise and improves with rest. The disease is caused by an autoimmune reaction at or near the post‐synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The results of this immune reaction are the lytic destruction of the post‐synaptic membrane and a reduction in the number of acetylcholine receptors. Myasthenia gravis can be diagnosed by repetitive exercise of the involved muscles, administration of edrophonium (Tensilon), electrophysiologic testing, or demonstration of anti‐acetylcholine receptor antibodies. When the myasthenic weakness is mild or limited to the extraocular muscles, it may be treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. When the weakness is more severe and/or more generalized, immunotherapy is most often indicated. Prednisone or prednisone plus thymectomy is the most frequently used form of immunotherapy. Azathioprine, 6‐mercaptopurine, plasmapheresis, or gamma globulin injections are other immunotherapeutic options that may be useful in selected patients. A large number of drugs may precipitate or exacerbate myasthenic weakness.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Pseudopheochromocytoma is an uncommon form of hypertension. In contrast to the more well-known pheochromocytoma, no unequivocal etiologic factor or a clear physiological abnormality can be identified. This disorder manifests in sudden, recurrent, episodes of significant, sometimes extreme, increase in blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, lasting from minutes to hours, with no consistent trigger that the patient or the doctor is aware of, and is accompanied by typical symptoms. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, headaches, fever, flushing, weakness, with or without an accelerated heart rate. Patients with this disorder have increased sympathetic activity, from an adrenal source or sympathetic nerve endings, as well as hyper-responsiveness of the heart and blood vessels to this activation. There is an increased secretion of epinephrine and dopamine in the case of an adrenal source, and norepinephrine in the case of the sympathetic nerve endings. It is important to perform the differential diagnosis of this condition to rule out pheochromocytoma by testing plasma and urinary metanephrines. Additional diagnoses that need to be excluded are anxiety attacks, fluctuating-episodic hypertension, and baroreflex failure. The therapeutic approach of this disorder includes a combination of drugs to lower and control blood pressure, especially drugs that block alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors, along with antianxiety and antidepressants. Psychological intervention, as well as techniques that are aimed to reduce anxiety, have a place in therapy, especially among those patients who can relate the manifestations of the disorder to mental and emotional factors that contribute to the clinical manifestations.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs. Four of the most common epilepsies are: (1) grand mal — manifested by major convulsions, usually a sequence of tonic spasm of all body musculature followed by synchronous clonic jerking and prolonged post-seizure depression of all central functions; (2) petit mal — characterized by brief attacks of loss of consciousness usually accompanied by some clonic motor activity, sometimes with no motor activity, and sometimes with complete relaxation of all musculature; (3) psychomotor epilepsy — characterized by attacks of confused behavior with a wide variety of clinical manifestations; (4) focal cortical epilepsy in which there may be motor abnormalities including convulsions of single limbs or muscle groups or specific and localized sensory disturbances depending on the particular area of cortex producing the abnormal electrical activity.",

The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded. In the event of an emergency (e.g., hypoglycemic coma) the usual form of treatment is the administration of glucoses or glucagon.",

Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use. Nevertheless, these methods do not work equally well for all types of addicts.",

In this paper, the literature surveying the uses of clozapine in the treatment of patients with nonschizophrenic illnesses, in particular psychotic affective disorders (bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder), will be reviewed. (A Medline search was done for all papers concerning clozapine; those that represented major contributions to the literature were used.) Results from a prospective study at McLean Hospital assessing the effects of diagnosis on response will be presented. Several other uses in nonschizophrenic patients will also be discussed. Because of its relative freedom from extrapyramidal side effects, it is an important agent in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease who also have psychotic symptoms. It may be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in nearly 50% of patients with that symptom. In addition, the drug may be useful in treating violent patients and those with certain movement disorders, atypical borderline personality disorder, or chronic psychotic symptoms. Due to the risk of agranulocytosis, clozapine cannot yet be considered a first-choice treatment for psychotic symptoms, but many studies indicate it to be helpful with a wide variety of treatment-resistant ones.",

In addition, the epilepsy itself may cause changes in the nervous system through the metabolic and excitotoxic effects of the seizures and the neurotransmitter elements involved at the membrane level. The effect of the treatment modality, be it pharmacologic or surgical, may also play havoc with cognitive function. The neurobehavioral effects of antiepileptic drugs, although probably less important with the newer agents than in the past, must be considered, especially in polypharmacy, as recent reports have indicated. With increasing data, the effects of various surgical procedures on the cognitive elements of human behavior are becoming better recognized.",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

The wide variety of seemingly unrelated independent stereotypies generated by central stimulants is also puzzling.

This is however less the case with certain patient subgroups who may exhibit significant adverse responses to therapeutics that are otherwise well-tolerated. We report a case of psychosis induced by exposure to a commonly prescribed drug to treat muscle spasms and associated pain cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril®). Cyclobenzaprine is structurally very similar to tricyclic anti-depressants, such as amyltriptine. While it is well known that agitation caused by cyclobenzaprine is not an uncommon occurrence in the elderly, there have also been sporadic reports of significant psychosis in association with the use of cyclobenzaprine in younger patients. We report a case of reversible mania in a susceptible 44-year-old patient with a lengthy history of mild borderline personality and bipolar disorder. Shortly after being treated with cyclobenzaprine for pain due to a minor injury, this patient exhibited significant signs of mania although these signs were readily reversible upon termination of the treatment with cyclobenzaprine. The patient's severe adverse reaction to this normally innocuous drug adds weight to the notion that there is reason for caution with its prescription for potentially susceptible patient subgroups.",

      "abstract": "DiscussionThere has been an increase recently in the use of L.S.D. in this country on a casual basis and not under medical supervision.Use in this way as a \"mind-expanding\" drug has been extensively discussed in the press and on television, and has been advocated in non-medical journals.After a similar interest in the non-medical uses of the drug and extensive self-medication by fringe groups in New York therc was a sudden upsurge of admissions to Bellevue Hospital with acute reactions from its use (Frosch et al., 1965).These fell into three groups: (1) acute panic reactions; (2) recurrence of symptoms while abstaining from the drug, which was more likely to occur after multiple ingestion; and (3) prolonged psychosis.Cases 1, 2, and 5 reported here appeared to be acute panic reactions, and Cases 3 and 4 a recurrence of symptoms in a period of abstinence.Case 4 also showed signs of a prolonged psychosis.Case 6 may have been due to disordered judge- ment or a psychotic reaction.Prolonged adverse reactions, including chronic hallucinatory states, also occur (Rosenthal, 1964).Owing to the fashion of using sugar cubes as a vehicle for black market L.S.D. it can also be taken accidentally-for example, by children-and three such cases have been reported.One of these sustained a dissociative state, accom- panied by anxiety and visual illusions, that lasted for several weeks (Cohen, 1966).Cases 5 and 6 show the need to look for L.S.D. and amphetamines at necropsy in deaths of this type, lest some be wrongly attributed to suicide.Despite the statements of the protagonists of the use of this drug that it is safe, L.S.D. can be dangerous when taken casually-for example, when not taken by selected patients under strict medical supervision and with the use of proper safeguards.The incidence of adverse effects associated with controlled use of the drug by physicians suggested that in medical hands it was an exceptionally safe drug (Levine and Ludwig, 1964). SummaryRecently there has been an increase in the use of lysergide (lysergic acid diethylamide; L.S.D.) obtained illicitly.Adverse reactions are not uncommon, and six (two fatal) cases are reported.I am grateful to Professor F. E. Camps, Dr. A. Robinson, and Mr. F. F",

      "abstract": "The psychotropic drugs responsible for side effects on the gastrointestinal tract are essentially those that develop the most effective anticholinergic actions. But also to be taken into account are the depression of the central nervous system, the alpha adrenergic effects and the indirect results of the relief of the anxiety and depression symptoms. In spite of the anti-emetic properties of the antipsychotic drugs, nauseas and vomiting appear as frequently as with placebos. The antipsychotic and antidepressive drugs provoke dysphagia and achalasia, because of a loss of tonus. Some cases of hiatal hernia are attributed to tricyclic antidepressants. The latter drugs, as well as IMOA and aliphatic and piperidinated phenothiazines, induce constipation in psychiatric patients, who are already prone to it. Even ileus may occur, or dilatation of the bowel or the stomach. Diarrhea is rare. Patients treated with psychotropics often complain of a dry mouth (xerostomy). This unpleasant sensation is succesfully treated with betanechol (75 mg/d) which does not impair - as pilocarpine does - the therapeutic effects. Dental caries, moniliasis and parotidites have been attributed to neuroleptic drugs or tricyclic antidepressants, on account of the inhibition of the salivary flow. Vomiting, diarrhea and epigastric burning appear in 10% of the patients treated with lithium (even when the posology is correct).",

Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

The classic signs and symptoms (toxidrome) often seen with the sympathomimetic drugs include hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia; some of these drugs also precipitate psychoses, hallucinations and seizures. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is experiencing a sympathomimetic drug reaction can be helpful to the clinician. However, some of the conventional toxicologic drug screens used by many clinical laboratories do not differentiate within a specific class of drugs (eg, amphetamine vs methamphetamine). Although a drug screen can help to confirm ingestion of a sympathomimetic drug, diagnosis and treatment are often based on history of use (often unreliable), physical examination, and the classic toxidrome observed with this class of drugs.",

      "title": "Aggression and Violence",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

They are sold as replacements to established drugs such as cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Among adolescents in Europe, NPS are gaining popularity. Despite the increasing use of NPS, information about the acute health effects remains scarce and is even worse for the long-term effects or the addictive potential of NPS. Severe or fatal cases of NPS intoxications are reported. Although several authors warn about the addictive potential of synthetic cathinones, case reports or larger studies in humans are scarce. We present the case of a patient addicted to 4-methylethcathinone/pentedrone and an acute intoxication with 3-methoxyphencyclidine-piperidine cyclohexane carbonitrile. This case shows that the addictive potential of synthetic cathinones should not be underestimated.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this article is to review the literature on the effects of psychostimulants in epileptic subjects in order to reach a consensus statement regarding the use or abuse of these substances.Psychostimulant substances have been considered the drugs that share the ability to produce excitation of the CNS leading to convulsions. The stimulation may be at cortical, brainstem, or spinal levels. In this article, the following cortical stimulants are analyzed and discussed: cocaine, amphetamine and related agents, caffeine, cannabinoids, and psychedelic drugs. This review is based on research done using pharmacological textbooks and Medline.The use of cocaine is associated with the occurrence of seizures. The reported frequency varies from 1% to 40% of addicted subjects, based on the typology of the considered study. Amphetamines and related drugs rarely induce epileptic seizures at therapeutic doses, but seizures may occur after the first dosing. Caffeine at high doses may induce epileptic seizures because of its adenosine receptor-antagonizing properties. Marijuana, at variance with other psychostimulants, owing to its serotonin-mediated anticonvulsant action, could have a medical use for the treatment of epilepsy. Psychedelic compounds rarely induce epileptic seizures, but the most common clinical CNS complication after ingestion of ecstasy is the occurrence of seizures.The use of psychostimulants, except for marijuana, can induce single or multiple seizures in healthy subjects.",

It is a common disorder affecting all ages, with existing comorbidities and positive family history being associated with increased prevalence. Herein, we present a case of a 51-year-old female diagnosed with the bipolar affective disorder who developed restless leg syndrome following the use of olanzapine. Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic which can cause restless leg syndrome due to its anti-dopaminergic action on the nervous system, particularly the spinal cord. Existing literature on olanzapine-induced restless leg syndrome has suggested managing this disorder by reducing the dose or replacing olanzapine with other drugs such as clonazepam, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. In our case, olanzapine was not replaced with other medications as the patient showed a significant improvement in bipolar affective disorder symptoms using olanzapine. Instead, clonazepam was added to the treatment regimen which was scheduled to be taken before olanzapine.",

(1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations. Helping patients find a medication formulation that suits their needs strengthens adherence and the therapeutic relationship.

Nevertheless, the historical accounts of the properties of marijuana have provided an impetus for modern investigations on the effects and potential therapeutic uses of marijuana, its constituents, and their analogs. A seizure is a paroxysmal event that consists of a transient distortion of normal electrical activity in the brain and some alteration of normal motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic function. Convulsions subsequent to cannabinoid administration have been reported to occur under certain conditions in \"normal\" animals, genetically seizure-susceptible animals, and experimentally seizure-susceptible animals. Convulsions subsequent to relatively low-dose administration of cannabinoids can occur in animals rendered seizure susceptible by some experimental techniques. Gammaaminobutyric acid deficiency may be involved in chorea, tardive dyskinesia, and spasticity, and serotonin deficiency in postanoxic myoclonus and perhaps in other neurological disorders.",

The standard of investigation of children with severe mental retardation has improved very much in the past few years. New techniques have been developed, and unsuspected causes have been recognized. In phenylketonuria and a number of other errors of body chemistry, the normal function of the brain is disturbed. The phenylalanine is essential to normal brain activity, and the fact that it cannot be used in a normal manner may cause difficulty. Difficulty may also arise by interference of the excess of phenylalanine with other chemical activities in the brain and elsewhere. One rather striking side effect of this nature is interference with the normal production of the skin and hair pigment. This results in patients with phenylketonuria being fairer than their normal brothers and sisters. The cause of phenylketonuria is the absence or abnormality of an enzyme in the liver, which enables phenylalanine to be used. The nature of this enzyme is known but it has not been possible to devise any way in which the missing enzyme can be replaced.",

      "title": "Isn’t it Time to Use Opioid Drugs in Emergency Medical Services?",
      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant feeling and experience that is caused by a potential or practical injury and its control is so important that the American Pain Society has introduced pain as the 5 th vital sign for emphasizing the importance of pain and controlling it. Almost all humans have experienced moderate to severe pain and most of the time the experience has happened following surgical procedures, medical conditions or trauma. When pain manifests in a clinical condition, health care staff are responsible for following it and relieving it as a goal and responsibility. Pain affects all individuals regardless of age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status and untreated pain can negatively affect various systems of the body and lead to many consequences. Increase in serum level of cortisol, nor epinephrine, and renin angiotension, hyperglycemia, decrease in insulin, manifestation of anxiety, cardiac effects such as ischemia, dysrhythmia, increase in pulse, increase in cardiac load, increased oxygen uptake, increased blood coagulation potential, hypertension especially in patients with head injuries, decreased blood oxygen level, increased body fluid volume, drop in blood potassium, fatigue, muscle cramps, decreased immune system function, decreased ability for wound healing and etc. are among the undesirable side effects of pain. In addition, not treating acute pains also leads to bearing unnecessary pain, elongated duration of hospitalization, increased medical costs and probability of acute pain progressing and developing into chronic pain. The financial burden of not treating pain in America has been estimated to be about 100 billion dollars per year. Pain is a common complaint and makes up a considerable portion of reasons that patients call pre-hospital emergency services and is usually present in the injured and trauma patients. Study results showed that 20% to 31% of the patients presenting via ambulances had moderate and severe pain. Additionally, with 52% to 86% prevalence in emergencies, pain is a key topic in health care of various countries. Pre-hospital emergency staff members are the first in line among health care staff that face patients at times of disaster and accident and are more exposed to the patients’ pain. Despite the quantitative growth of pre-hospital emergency bases to 1900 bases throughout Iran, observations of researchers and evidence and instructions of emergency medical services (EMS) of Iran are indicative of not using enough analgesic drugs, especially opioid analgesic drugs, as a means to relieve patients’ pain in EMS ambulances. Some studies have mentioned that about one third of the pre-hospital patients and more than 80% of patients with bone fractures report moderate to severe pain and on the other hand the positive effect of using pain killers in the regions that used them have been shown to be obvious in most patients. It seems that using analgesics in EMS is a very important topic and researchers express that proper pain management is an important principle in pre-hospital care and opioid analgesics such as morphine and fentanyl have a special place in the instructions of EMS as treatments for acute trauma and non-trauma pains, especially cardiac chest pains, in some advanced countries regarding emergency care. Considering the afore-mentioned points concerning the importance of pain and its treatment, especially the importance of treating pain in traumatic and ischemic cardiac diseases, high prevalence of pain in pre-hospital missions, severity and type of pre-hospital missions, which are mostly associated with pain, high costs of not treating pain and the obvious need for using pain killers in trauma and ischemic cardiac diseases, isn’t it time to introduce a more effective and scientific approach in EMS? Isn’t it better to add a few types of analgesics and opioid drugs to the equipment provided at patients’ bedside, at least for ischemic cardiac diseases and severe trauma? Although the result of a study carried out in Khuzestan province showed that EMS staff members were weak regarding drug information and calculations and other studies have also expressed that drug dosage and use of opioid drugs might not be done correctly or opioid drugs might be abused in some cases, none are convincing reasons for not using these drugs. These problems could be solved by more and better training for EMS staff, creating offline and online protocols and useful programs for preventing abuse of analgesic drugs and these drugs could be effectively used in EMS. Therefore, we again note that this treatment priority should not be overlooked for any reason.",

      "abstract": "Dizziness means many different things to different people: lightheadedness, vertigo, poor balance, mental fogginess, and others concerns. Lightheadedness, meaning a feeling like the patient may pass out, is usually due to low blood pressure, often orthostatic hypotension. Vertigo, meaning a sensation of spinning or movement, can be an inner ear problem or a brain problem: Stop toxic substances; if there is nystagmus, refer to ENT for a full evaluation; perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to assess for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; and refer to physical therapy for repositioning maneuvers if positive; consider vestibular rehabilitation; consider a short course of medication such as scopolamine or meclizine; consider ordering an MRI scan of the brain, as sometimes the concussion unmasks another unrelated problem. Dizziness meaning “mental fogginess” usually turns out to be attention deficit. Dizziness meaning vague and nonspecific malaise usually turns out to be fatigue, depression, or anxiety.",

      "title": "Parkinsonian Symptoms during Emergence from General Anesthesia",
      "abstract": "(Muravchick) Professor of Anesthesia.(Smith) Associate Professor of Anesthesia.Received from the Department of Anesthesia, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Submitted for publication June 14, 1994. Accepted for publication September 14, 1994.Address reprint requests to Dr. Muravchick: Department of Anesthesia, Courtyard 402, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104–4283.Key words: Anesthetics, volatile: isoflurane. Disease: Parkinson's disease. Postoperative complications: akinesis; delayed extubation; rigidity.THE fundamental neurochemical lesion that causes idiopathic or primary Parkinson's disease (Paralysis agitans) is well established, but the anesthetic implications of dopaminergic deficiency within the basal ganglia remain unknown. The literature relevant to anesthetic practice simply cautions against the perioperative use of adjuvant drugs that are thought to have dopaminergic blocking or cholinomimetic properties. [1,2] It remains unclear whether general anesthesia is associated with significant changes in dopaminergic activity. We present a report of severe and prolonged dystonic muscle rigidity during emergence from otherwise routine general anesthesia in a patient who was subsequently found to have classic Parkinson's disease.An apparently healthy white man, 54 yr old, 178 cm, 80 kg, was scheduled for open cholecystectomy after 4 days of hospitalization for intravenous antibiotic therapy (mezlocillin, gentamycin) instituted for severe right upper-quadrant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and recurrent shaking chills. All laboratory data were within normal limits except for a slightly increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, suggesting a diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis or hydrops of the gallbladder. The patient's prior annual physical examinations had revealed no objective abnormalities in any screening studies but made passing mention of complaints of persistent anxiety, a lack of a general sense of well being, and recurrent constipation. The patient also had experienced skeletal muscle spasms after taking prochlorperazine (Compazine) to treat attacks of nausea. The attending anesthesiologist who visited the patient the afternoon before surgery described a preanesthetic evaluation of ASA physical status 1. Nursing notes revealed that the patient again experienced muscle spasms of his torso and jaw within 1–2 h after he asked for and received 10 mg oral prochlorperazine for nausea. These symptoms resolved after subsequent treatment with 100 mg oral diphenhydramine (Benadryl).Upon arrival in the operating room, the patient was sedated with 2 mg intravenous midazolam and 50 ug fentanyl. Bilateral intercostal blocks placed at a total of 12 segments required 30 ml of preservative-free 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine. Induction of anesthesia with 375 mg thiopental and neuromuscular blockade with 75 mg atracurium for intubation and subsequent surgical relaxation was similarly routine and unremarkable. Inspired isoflurane concentrations between 0.8% and 1.25% in oxygen/nitrous oxide 30/70% produced a hemodynamically stable intraoperative course. The surgical specimen, a gall bladder with obvious hydrops, was removed 40 min after incision, and the wound was closed and infiltrated directly with an additional 15 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine. Forty milligrams edrophonium with 0.4 mg glycopyrrolate brought neuromuscular transmission, which had partially recovered spontaneously, to a fully sustained response to 5O-Hz tetanic stimulation within 3 min. Intravenous atropine (0.5 mg) was given shortly thereafter to treat transient bradycardia. Arterial oxygen saturation as estimated by pulse oximetry never decreased to less than 98%, and body temperature decreased only 0.2 degrees Celsius.Despite prompt resumption of spontaneous ventilation, tracheal extubation was delayed 1 h by a markedly prolonged period of emergence from anesthesia. Within minutes after discontinuation of nitrous oxide, the patient exhibited sustained rigid extension of his extremities. He failed to demonstrate any facial grimaces, nor did he respond to direct commands. There were no visible clonic contractions, muscle tremors, fasciculations, or other evidence of seizure activity or shivering. Eventually, he appeared to make purposeful efforts, turning his head and slowly reaching for the endotracheal tube, but he did not verbalize until 30 min after tracheal extubation, when he complained of inability to urinate. Over the next 45 min, he showed progressive improvement in responsiveness to questions and orientation and more normal skeletal muscle tone. The postanesthetic progress note made at this time by the attending anesthesiologist described “a dystonic, Parkinsonian-type phenomenon…almost certainly not a specific reaction or adverse response to the anesthetic agents used.”At no time within 24 h of surgery did this patient receive phenothiazines, butyrophenones, or any other drugs known to produce dystonic reactions or extrapyramidal side effects. Two hours after tracheal extubation, the patient's internist recommended continued avoidance of these drugs and observed “no neurologic deficit.” The balance of the hospital course was remarkable only for persistent urinary retention and intermittent diarrhea. He was discharged home from the hospital on the 3rd postoperative day. Eighteen months later, overt symptoms and a definitive diagnosis of Parkinson's disease required him to markedly reduce his professional activities. Treatment with levodopa/carbidopa eventually produced dramatic improvement and he was able to resume his former responsibilities.This apparently healthy patient had a severe dystonic reaction on emergence from an otherwise uneventful general anesthetic. Transient hyperreflexia and posturing is common after general anesthesia before recovery of full consciousness, [3] but prolonged muscle rigidity, expressionless facies, and unresponsiveness to verbal command is unusual. Sustained tonic motor activity is associated more often with malignant hyperpyrexia and myotonia, [4] neuroleptic malignant syndrome, [5] or the Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. [6] This patient did not present with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease either established or suspected, nor did he exhibit “classic” Parkinsonian symptoms preoperatively. In retrospect, however, his susceptibility to skeletal muscle spasm and what had appeared to be nonspecific and noncontributory chronic complaints of constipation and mild depression can be recognized as prodromal symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which are especially common in individuals diagnosed in their middle adult years. [7,8].There are prior reports of postoperative muscle rigidity in patients who have an established diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, [9] especially after use of fentanyl and droperidol. [10] Even in normal patients, however, generalized perioperative rigidity can occur after moderate to high dosages of fentanyl, [11] sufentanil, [12] or Innovar. [13] Opioid-induced muscle rigidity responds to neuromuscular blockade, but it occurs because of central nervous system effects, probably the inhibition of dopamine release. This hypothesis is consistent with observations that patients with Parkinsonism are predisposed to this narcotic side effect and with the three-fold increase in the incidence of fentanyl rigidity seen in geriatric individuals, [14] a patient subpopulation known to experience progressive compromise of dopaminergic activity even in the absence of overt symptoms. [15] Attempts to prevent fentanyl-induced rigidity with amantadine, a stimulant for dopamine release, have not, however, been successful. [16] In any case, the very small amount of fentanyl used here and the lack of any side effects within 20 min after intravenous administration suggest that opioids played little role in this dystonic event.In contrast, potent inhalational anesthetics may increase, rather than decrease, brain extracellular dopamine concentrations during general anesthesia. [17,18] Because the transport of dopamine by synaptosomes is impaired during and after exposure to halothane or isoflurane, [19] there may be decreased dopaminergic transmission as well as accumulation of extracellular dopamine during inhalational anesthesia because of simultaneous dopaminergic receptor blockade and depressed neuronal release and reuptake of dopamine. [20] Haloperidol, an established dopaminergic blocking drug, produces both Parkinsonian symptoms and measurable increases in extracellular dopamine. [21,22] Transient dystonia during emergence from general anesthesia therefore could reflect any of a number of possible dopamine-mediated mechanisms. Not surprisingly, therefore, a review of the contemporary anesthetic literature does not reveal a consensus regarding specific guidelines for anesthetic selection in the perioperative management of the patient with Parkinsonism.In summary, this report describes an apparently healthy patient who had a dramatic, prolonged period of generalized Parkinsonian-like dystonia and masklike facies during emergence from anesthesia and was later diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease. Inhalational anesthesia, perhaps in combination with adjunctive drugs commonly used in anesthetic practice, produced overt symptoms of primary Parkinsonism in a patient who had only the most subtle clinical evidence of a preexisting dopaminergic deficiency. We believe that this phenomenon has not been reported previously despite the large numbers of patients with established Parkinson's disease, because once diagnosed, dopaminergic activity has been enhanced adequately by ongoing therapy or perhaps because the perioperative symptoms were transient and sufficiently similar to routine anesthetic emergence to be overlooked.",

The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state. A theory of possible \"asthenic metabolic changes\" due to disturbances in the hormonal-vegetative system, and its practical application were discussed.",

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background and Importance</h3> Sleep disturbance is very prevalent in critically ill patients. Treatment approaches to improve sleep have focused on both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies. Trazodone is an atypical antidepressant used with highly frequency as hypnotic. The main side effects described for trazodone are self-injurious thoughts, anaemia, seizures, paraesthesia, confusion or dyspnoea. It can inhibit dopaminergic neurotransmission in the midbrain and as result, cause extrapyramidal effects. <h3>Aim and Objectives</h3> To describe a case of parkinsonism induced by taking trazodone as hypnotic in a patient admitted in a Critical Care Unit (CCU). <h3>Material and Methods</h3> A 57-year old man with no relevant medical history was admitted to CCU in May 2021 with pneumonia caused by COVID-19 disease. The patient suffered from insomnia. The physician prescribed trazodone starting with a dose of 50 mg and then 100 mg. <h3>Results</h3> That afternoon, after taking trazodone, the nurse described slight tremor intensified with movement in upper extremities. The physician on duty was notified but he did not find any explanation. Next day, the official physician checked the medication with the critical care pharmacist. The syndrome was not explained by analytics or other tests. The pharmacist checked all patient`s medications searching information in different databases: the official labels and the clinical trials, PubMed<sup>®</sup> and UpToDate<sup>®</sup>. In addition, she checked possible interactions in Lexicomp® database but she did not find nothing. Trazodone was the unique drug associated with the syndrome. The physician and the pharmacist agreed to discontinue the medication to check if the syndrome disappeared. The following days, the patient continued with tremble on movement. The pattern of the movement was similar each day. It started at afternoons and disappear during nights. The intensity of the movement was reduced each day. The syndrome disappeared completely one week later. Based on causality assessment of adverse drug reactions by Naranjo et al., we classify this event as probable/likely. The pharmacist notified this adverse effect to pharmacovigilance. <h3>Conclusion and Relevance</h3> Trazodone is considered safe and used frequently in our medical system, so the knowledge of effects like that is important. Nevertheless, the parkinsonism induced was reverse and disappear one week later once the treatment was stopped. <h3>References and/or Acknowledgements</h3> Naranjo et al, Clin Pharmacol Ther 1981.30:239-4. <h3>Conflict of Interest</h3> No conflict of interest.",

      "title": "Indomethacin-Induced Behavioral Changes in an Elderly Patient with Dementia",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of behavioral changes induced by indomethacin in an elderly man with a history of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type. CASE SUMMARY: A 92-year-old white man with a history of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, glaucoma, and constipation was treated with indomethacin for an episode of pseudogout. After six doses of indomethacin 25 mg, the patient became very agitated, confused, and was physically and verbally aggressive to the nurses. Indomethacin was discontinued and the patient recovered after receiving haloperidol 0.5 mg/d po over a period of 10 days. DISCUSSION: Only a few cases of psychosis have been reported in the literature concerning the use of indomethacin in patients over the age of 60 years. The mechanism by which indomethacin causes psychosis is not well understood, but it is postulated that the acute psychosis may be related to the similarity between the molecular structure of indomethacin and serotonin. Both indomethacin and serotonin have an indolic moiety, which may explain the development of acute psychosis in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare providers should be aware that patients with a history of dementia who are receiving indomethacin may be at risk of developing severe behavior problems along with gastrointestinal and renal adverse effects. OBJETIVO: Informar un caso de cambios en conducta inducidos por indometacina en un envejeciente varón con historial de demencia senil del tipo Alzheimer. RESUMEN DEL CASO: Un hombre blanco de 92 años con historial de demencia senil del tipo Alzheimer, glaucoma, y constipación fue tratado con indometacina para un episodio de pseudogota. Después de seis dosis de indometacina de 25 mg, el paciente se puso bien agitado, confuso, y física y verbalmente agresivo con las enfermeras. Indometacina fue descontinuada y el paciente se recuperó con una dosis de haloperidol 0.5 mg oral diario por un período de 10 días. DISCUSIÓN: Solo algunos casos de psicosis han sido reportados en la literatura con el uso de indometacina en pacientes sobre 60 años. El mecanismo por el cual indometacina produce la psicosis no es bien comprendido pero se cree que la psicosis aguda puede estar relacionada a la similaridad de la estructura molecular de indometacina y serotonina. Tanto la indometacina y serotonina tienen un componente indólico que podría explicar el desarrollo de psicosis aguda en éste paciente. CONCLUSIONES: Los proveedores de cuidado de la salud deben estar concientes que los pacientes con historial de demencia que están recibiendo indometacina podrían desarrollar severos problemas de conducta asi como efectos secundarios gastrointestinal y renal. OBJECTIF: Décrire le cas d'une personne âgée présentant avec des troubles de comportement suite à la prise d'indométhacine. RÉSUMÉ DU CAS: Un homme blanc de 92 ans présentant avec une histoire de démence de type Alzheimer, de glaucome, et de constipation a été traité avec de l'indométhacine 25 mg trois fois par jour pour un épisode de pseudogoutte. Après 2 jours de traitement avec l'indométhacine, à raison de 25 mg trois fois par jour, le patient a présenté avec de l'agitation et de la confusion. Il est devenu agressif physiquement et verbalement envers le personnel infirmier. L'indométhacine a été discontinué et le patient a reçu de haloperidol 0.5 mg chaque jour pour une période de 10 jours. DISCUSSION: Seulement quelques cas de psychose induite par l'indométhacine ont été rapportés dans la littérature chez des patients de plus de 60 ans. Le mécanisme d'action par lequel la psychose se manifeste n'est pas encore bien élucidé. Il a été postulé que la psychose serait associée à la similarité dans les structures chimiques de lindométhacine et la sérotonine. La molécule de l'indométhacine et celle de la sérotonine possèdent un groupe indolique, ce qui pourrait expliquer le développement d'une psychose aiguë. CONCLUSIONS: Il est important de surveiller les changements de comportement chez les patients souffrant de démence lorsque l'indométhacine est prescrit.",

      "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression is defined as absence of remission despite trials of two or more antidepressant medications and can occur in up to 31% of patients with major depressive disorder. Partial response to treatment is defined as less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. Before diagnosing treatment-resistant depression or partial response to treatment, adherence to adequate doses and duration of medications should be confirmed. Management strategies include adding psychotherapy, switching antidepressant medication class, or augmenting with additional medications. Current guidelines recommend augmentation with a second-generation antidepressant, an atypical antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, or a triiodothyronine medication as pharmacologic options. Ketamine and esketamine can also be used as augmentation for treatment-resistant depression and may help reduce suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be effective. Pharmacogenetic testing has limited evidence and is not recommended. Nonpharmacologic therapies include psychotherapy, exercise, and focused dietary changes.",

From the practical standpoint, the author shows how Funkenstein's epinephrine-methacholine (Mecholyl) test will point almost unerringly to the method most likely to secure a favorable response to therapy. Even more important, however, is the recognition of depression as a trans-marginal inhibitory state, the product of insupportable anxiety.

The pain had a hyperesthetic quality and did not respond to the use of analgesics, including opiate derivatives. Treatment with therapeutic levels of a tricyclic antidepressant did not bring relief of symptoms. In one case, months after treatment and subsequent improvement of vitamin D status and pain, the vitamin D status again declined and the pain recurred. The pain again resolved with vitamin D replacement and improvement of levels. There may be a pain syndrome associated with vitamin D depletion that appears as hyperesthesia worsened by light, superficial pressure or even small increments of movement. This pain restricts mobility and function and may lead to further complications, such as pressure sores. (<i>Arch Intern Med.</i>1991;151:1662-1664)",

Abuse of a medication refers to excessive use of a drug to achieve a “high,” which may result in addiction to the medication and which causes dysfunction in a patient's life. However, misuse refers to usage of a medication without a prescription or for reasons other than that which it was prescribed. Diversion refers to the diverting of legally prescribed medication into illegal use by other than the patient. Sahakian and Morein-Zamir recently discussed the use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by individuals with a variety of disorders as well as off-label and non-prescription use by the general public. In addition to inappropriate use of medications, patients with ADHD often turn to other substances that are detrimental to their health, such as nicotine.",

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation for dystonia",
      "abstract": "The term 'dystonia' refers to a clinical syndrome of involuntary and repetitive muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and body postures. The most common classification of dystonia is based on the three axes: etiology; age of disease onset; and distribution of affected body regions. The etiology of dystonia may be primary or secondary to an acquired cause (e.g., a hypoxic brain injury). Secondary dystonias are typically not 'pure' dystonias, but are accompanied by other neurological signs and symptoms. Exceptions are acute dystonic reactions or tardive dystonia (TD) caused by the acute or chronic use of antidopaminergic drugs, which are pure and clinically indistinguishable from primary dystonias. Primary dystonias may be accompanied by Parkinsonism or myoclonus only and are termed 'dystonia plus' syndromes in these cases. A genetic cause has been identified in an increasing number of primary dystonias or dystonia-plus syndromes. These monogenic forms are referred to as DYT1 to DYT20 (for a review see [1]). The severity and distribution of dystonia is linked to age with a greater tendency to develop generalized dystonia with an early onset (below 26 years of age) versus a late onset (>26 years of age). The distribution of dystonia can be described as focal (only a single body region affected), segmental (two adjacent body parts affected), multifocal (several noncontiguous parts affected), generalized or hemidystonia (one body half affected). The three diagnostic axes help to characterize clinically distinct forms of dystonia with a particular cause and prognosis; for example, early onset primary focal dystonia tends to generalize rapidly, can lead to severe physical disability and is often monogenic (e.g., DYT1 or DYT6), whereas the more prevalent adult-onset focal dystonias show little progression and are mostly sporadic.",

We present a case of SSEH with neuropathic pain that was treated with gabapentin, morphine and imipramine. The patient developed choreoathetosis temporally related to adjunctive therapy with gabapentin at dosages of 1200 mg per day. We discontinued the gabapentin treatment and choreoathetosis decreased gradually the next day and disappeared 5 days later.

      "abstract": "Major tranquilizers as well as antidepressant agents have been associated with clinical seizures in patients administered these agents. The incidence of such seizures is generally low when these drugs are administered in therapeutic doses. However, administration of large doses of these agents has been associated with many cases of convulsion production. The effects that these drugs have on animal models of epilepsy have been examined. It appears that the phenothiazines act as convulsant agents at lower doses, whereas, at higher doses, they act as anticonvulsant drugs. Antidepressants, on the other hand, appear to exert an anticonvulsant effect at low doses and convulsant effects at high doses. The mechanism by which these agents alter the seizure threshold is not yet known. Clinically, drugs of lower seizure production potential should be substituted for those drugs with greater potential in treating epileptic patients for psychiatric ailments. The problem of sudden death in epileptic patients is one that must be confronted. Sudden death has most frequently been attributed to autonomic dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmia in these patients. The contribution of stress in sudden death production also must be taken into account. In addition, some psychoactive agents have been associated with sudden death as well as cardiac arrhythmia and seizure production. Thus, in light of the possible additivity of the factors involved in the production of sudden death, the administration of a psychoactive agent to an epileptic patient should be approached with caution. Those agents that do not alter cardiac rhythm or seizure threshold should be administered if a psychoactive agent is deemed necessary for the management of psychiatric illness in the epileptic patient.",

Adjunctive (or adjuvant) analgesics, defined as drugs that do not contain acetaminophen and those not classified as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory or opioid agents, play a role in the management of chronic pain. The term “adjunctive” (or “adjuvant”) is a misnomer as several of these agents may constitute first‐line therapy for many chronic pain syndromes. Tricyclic antidepressants have formed the backbone of therapy for chronic neuropathic pain for years. However, the difficulty with using agents of this class, due to their clinically significant adverse‐event potential, has led to the evaluation of other agents, most notably, the antiepileptic drugs. The most useful are gabapentin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. In selected patients, baclofen, mexiletine, and clonidine may be useful as well. Cancer‐related pain may respond substantially to corticosteroids, and pain associated with bone metastases to parenteral bisphosphonates and strontium. Practitioners should consider these alternative agents when treating chronic pain.",

This syndrome appeared to have resulted from anti-psychotic drugs given to relieve excitement and insomnia. As he had hepatic dysfunctions, we could not administer dantrolene further. Therefore, we gave bromocriptine to ameliorate the symptoms such as muscle rigidity or hemodynamic perturbations. Thereafter, the patient gradually became stable in hemodynamics and in other symptoms. In addition, a further deterioration in hepatic functions did not occur with administration of bromocriptine. The case suggests that in patients with malignant syndrome associated with hepatic dysfunctions, bromocriptine could be a first choice as a pharmacological treatment of the syndrome.",

This medication was initially developed to treat muscle spasms and pulmonary hypertension. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its usage for treating ED. Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil are PDE5 inhibitors. The decrease of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in smooth muscle cells caused by sildenafil causes smooth muscle relaxation and penile erection. Vasodilation of the blood vessels reduces perfusion and blood flow to the optic nerve and eye. Several incidences of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have been recorded in sildenafil users, among other ocular complications. The onset of NAION is usually sudden and painless, and it is associated with any pattern of visual field loss. Possible symptoms include poor visual acuity, diminished color vision, a visual field defect, or hemorrhages in the form of flames. Nevertheless, NAION pathogenesis is still a mystery. Most visual effects are reversible weeks after the medication is stopped, and NAION does not seem to cause a permanent blindness. A small cup-to-disc ratio (disc at risk) and underlying systemic illnesses, such as hypertension, increase the risk of developing NAION. An early indicator of cardiovascular disease is ED. NAION diagnosis is challenging due to a lack of confirmatory diagnostic evidences. Normal visual acuity does not exclude NAION from being a possibility. In order to evaluate visual outcomes in NAION, data on both visual acuity (VA) and the full peripheral visual field are needed. Treatment with steroids did not seem to improve visual results.",

DATA SOURCES: Case reports and review articles identified by MEDLINE. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from pertinent published sources were reviewed and abstracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: A 49-year-old man developed symptoms of severe psychosis concomitant with ciprofloxacin (250 mg bid) treatment. Central nervous system effects secondary to ciprofloxacin treatment are uncommon and usually consist only of minor dizziness or mild headache, although rare occurrences of seizures and hallucinations have been reported. The mechanism by which ciprofloxacin causes these adverse effects is not fully understood. It has been suggested that quinolones may produce an epileptogenic effect by inhibiting the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid to its receptor sites in the brain. There is yet no explanation for the occurrence of hallucinations or psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be exercised when using ciprofloxacin in the treatment of patients with personality abnormalities or symptoms of psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Most of the drugs used in the treatment of aggressive syndromes have originally been developed for other clinical applications. Despite significant differences in the pathogenesis of various aggressive disorders, the frequently used “antiaggression” drugs are the major tranquilizers (neuroleptics). If the aggression is associated with psychosis, chlorpromazine or haloperidol are the drugs of choice. Aggressive disorders within the acute and chronic brain syndromes are best treated with pericyazine, thioridazine, and thiothixene. In aggressive symptoms of mentally retarded patients, particularly with epileptic syndromes, a new benzazepine (SCH-12,679) was found to be very effective. Aggression associated with alcoholism or narcotic addiction showed best response to chlorpromazine and haloperidol. As a general rule, in aggressive patients with clinically known epilepsy, or with abnormal electroencephalographic findings, the major tranquilizers with potent sedative properties should be given with great caution.",

      "title": "Clinical Relevance of Cannabis Tolerance and Dependence",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Psychoactive drugs are often widely used before tolerance and dependence is fully appreciated. Tolerance to cannabis‐induced cardiovascular and autonomic changes, decreased intraocular pressure, sleep and sleep EEG, mood and behavioral changes is acquired and, to a great degree, lost rapidly with optimal conditions. Mechanisms appear more functional than metabolic. Acquisition rate depends on dose and dose schedule. Dependence, manifested by withdrawal symptoms after as little as 7 days of THC administration, is characterized by irritability, restlessness, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, sweating, salivation, increased body temperature, altered sleep and waking EEG, tremor, and weight loss. Mild and transient in the 120 subjects studied, the syndrome was similar to sedative drug withdrawal. Tolerance to drug side effects can be useful. Tolerance to therapeutic effects or target symptoms poses problems. Clinical significance of dependence is difficult to assess since drug‐seeking behavior has many determinants. Cannabis‐induced super sensitivity should be considered wherever chronic drug administration is anticipated in conditions like epilepsy, glaucoma or chronic pain. Cannabis pharmacology suggests ways of minimizing tolerance and dependence problems.",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Benzodiazepines and Z‐drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

      "title": "Opioids for Anesthesia and Postoperative Pain Control",
      "abstract": "Opioid agonists are frequently used to provide anesthesia in combination with sedatives and hypnotic agents and manage postoperative acute pain. There are many different opioid agents available that differ in their potency, onset and duration of action, metabolism, drug interactions, and side-effect profile. All opioids have distinct effects upon various organ systems, including central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, and decreased gastrointestinal motility. Fentanyl and fentanyl-derived agents (alfentanil, sufentanil, remifentanil) are most frequently used in the intraoperative period due to their quick onset and duration of action, allowing them to be easily titrated and discontinued at the completion of a procedure. Oral opioids with moderate durations of action, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and morphine, are commonly used for acute pain management in the postoperative setting. When oral analgesics cannot be used, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia is another option for pain management. This review contains 5 figures, 11 tables, and 59 references. Key Words: analgesia, anesthesia, central nervous system depression, fentanyl, morphine, opioid agonist, pain management, patient-controlled analgesia, perioperative, respiratory depression",

      "title": "Pathophysiology and Organ Damage in Anaphylaxis",
      "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators into the systemic circulation. Foods, medications, and insect stings cause most anaphylaxis for which a cause can be identified, but virtually any agent capable of directly or indirectly activating mast cells or basophils can cause it. This syndrome can consist of some or all the following signs and symptoms: diffuse pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; hypotension; and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Some of the other symptoms that can occur include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, headache, feeling of impending doom, and unconsciousness. Regardless of the presenting signs or symptoms, which usually present within 5–30 min following the administration of the offending agent, this reaction can progress to respiratory compromise and cardiovascular collapse resulting in human fatalities. Usually, the more rapid the onset of clinical manifestations, the more likely the anaphylaxis will be life threatening. Immediate and appropriate therapy, especially with epinephrine, is mandatory to reverse the reactions. While most reactions are uniphasic, some can be biphasic or protracted. This chapter discusses the immunopathologic mechanisms and effects of anaphylaxis.",

It causes various health effects such as nausea, sweating, chills, muscle cramping, etc. The effect of this drug can be seen in 3 to 5 hours in the body. A spike in body temperature can be seen in MDMA users that can be fatal as it affects the liver, kidney, and heart leading to death. Addiction to MDMA is not yet proven, however, withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue and depression are noted. MDMA is usually taken via the mouth or snorting in the form of tablets or capsules. This drug is also taken or abused along with other drugs such as LSD, alcohol, and marijuana. MDMA is a scheduled drug with no proven medical use. MDMA causes a surge of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain to regulate mood, learning, memory, stress, anxiety, etc. This chapter discusses the effects of MDMA on the human brain.",

Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang. Proses pelepasan metabolit spesifik ketamin akan merangsang terjadinya peningkatan pelepasan sinaps glutamat yang menyebabkan efek antidepresan.

We used qualitative research method based on semi-directive interviews, in order to better understand meaning of \"chemical restraint\" term for geriatric medical and paramedical personnel. This term is well understood, rarely used, wrong for some professional because \"drugs do not hold\". The term of \"physical restraint\" has a more tangible reality. The term of \"sedation of psychocomportemental troubles\" is more common and seems to have a less pejorative connotation.

      "abstract": "Chronic tension type headache is a disorder evolving from frequent episodic tension-type headache, with daily or very frequent episodes of headache, typically bilateral, pressing or tightening in quality and of mild to moderate intensity, lasting hours to days, or unremitting. The pain does not worsen with routine physical activity, but may be associated with mild nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. The feeling of deontological guilt occurs in individuals who, violating moral standards of the society in which they live, wonder how they were capable of such an attitude.\r\n\r\nIn this guilt feeling brain areas that mediate disgust are stimulated as the insulas.\r\n\r\nThe proposal was to evaluate the ineffectiveness of the treatments [antidepressants, anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, NSAIDs or acetaminophen, tramadol, acetylsalicylic acid, opioids, muscle relaxants, psychotherapy, acupuncture] to which that 21 patients (15 men and 6 women) aged 40 to 52 were submitted for 2 years after stealing money from their clients motivated by revenge. All patients were professionals, no previous psychiatric and neurologic disorders. The headache started in sequence to no evidence of the crime.\r\n\r\nCounseling replaced treatments. The pain only remitted when each patient donated the stolen amount to charitable institutions to assuage guilt.\r\n\r\nThis study presents limitations: it is retrospective with a limited number of patients, showing a specific subpopulation of chronic tension-type headache. It is important to note that the criterion was limiter. This research supports a main conclusion that brain changes can be corrected, in this case, with the recognition of error and change of conduct.\r\n\r\nNo conflict of interest.",

      "title": "Psychological and social factors at work: contribution to musculoskeletal disorders and disabilities.",
      "abstract": "Psychological and social factors at work may contribute to musculoskeletal disorders by the following processes: (i) Direct pathogenic effects by affecting physiological mechanisms, such as muscle blood vessels and hormonal secretion; (ii) by altering work procedures and thereby altering the biomechanical loads through changes in posture, movements, and exerted forces; (iii) by altering sensations, mood, and cognitions, and thereby influencing symptoms, consequences of symptoms, and functional impairment; (iv) by interfering with buffer mechanisms, reducing the tolerance to other exposures. Almost all hypotheses of direct pathogenic effects (i) of psychological \"stress\" on muscle pain, maintain that the pain results from muscle-cell activation. The mechanisms proposed for the generation of pain are related to effects of energy deficit or intracellular calcium accumulation, leading to muscle-cell damage. However, it has not been possible to find reliable causal associations between muscle activation and pain. Furthermore, during active coping behaviours, muscle blood flow generally increases, rendering hypoxia less probable. Other hypotheses propose that increase in muscle-cell activity in musculoskeletal disorders is a consequence of the pain or that the pain originates from interactions between blood vessels and nociceptive nerves of the muscle. Explanations of the pathogenesis of pain generally do not yet account for the activation of sensory nerves (the nociceptors) that mediate information of potential tissue injury to the nerve system. Psychophysiological mechanisms determine whether pain become chronic and the consequences of pain. Mechanisms of the spinal medulla may amplify or inhibit transmission in the nociceptive circuits. Attention and perception are determined by the appraisal of the threat value of sensations. Pain sensations that are appraised to signal threat of injury or disability, are maintained and amplified. Pain beliefs contribute to the cognitive appraisal process. Health care personnel play a central role in forming pain beliefs by the way they inform of potential risk factors at the workplace and by the way they perform interventions and prevention measures. Therefore, the occupational health personnel must possess specific knowledge of which psychological and social factors contribute to musculoskeletal disorders and how their own recommendations may prevent or promote chronic disabilities.",

      "title": "Post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome",
      "abstract": "Central anticholinergic syndrome is defined as an absolute or relative reduction in cholinergic activity in the central nervous system [1]. In anaesthetic practice the syndrome was originally described in connection with drugs with central anticholinergic actions, such as hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) [2]. Later, many other drugs with no direct anticholinergic effects were implicated. This may be by modulation of other neurotransmitters which reduce cholinergic activity, but the mechanisms by which the syndrome occurs have not been fully explained [1]. The reported clinical features of the central anticholinergic syndrome in the post-operative period are non-specific. If they are all components of the syndrome the central nervous system would be widely involved (Table 1). There are said to be two forms of the syndrome: hyperactive or depressed. Peripheral anticholinergic symptoms may also occur but could by masked by peripheral cholinesterase inhibitors. Diagnosis rests on clinical features, exclusion of other conditions, and a positive response to a centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor, usually physostigmine [1].Table 1: Reported clinical features of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome The incidence of the post-operative syndrome has been estimated as 9.4% after general anaesthesia and 3.3% after regional anaesthesia with sedation [1], although an incidence as high as 40% has been claimed [5]. In their paper in this issue of the journal [6], Link et al. report an incidence of 1.9% in a broad mix of 962 adults after general anaesthesia, with a subgroup of women recovering from major gynaecological surgery having an incidence of 10%. These figures are in stark contrast with experience in the UK where central anticholinergic syndrome is diagnosed rarely. United Kingdom anaesthetists are either unaware of the syndrome, or do not believe it exists. Choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs may be an important determinant of reported incidence. Anaesthetists who use long acting drugs (benzodiazepines or barbiturates) will see a large number of patients who recover slowly from anaesthesia. Link et al. state that less than 3% of their study population were given droperidol as part of their anaesthetic, but eight of 18 patients with the syndrome received between 2.5 and 25 mg. The total number of patients given diazepam and phenobarbitone premedication is not stated, but nine of 18 affected patients received one of these drugs. What constitutes normal recovery from anaesthesia and a definition of what is abnormally prolonged are not stated. Clearly, the earlier that features of the syndrome are sought the higher will be their incidence in the post-operative period. Interindividual variations in anaesthetic drugs and technique, as well as variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, must also be taken into account. From the clinical features it is obvious that the list of differential diagnoses is long. As there is no diagnostic test, the diagnosis is made by exclusion of hypoxia, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, hypothermia, urea and electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, and neurological disturbance from surgery, vascular disease or trauma [1]. The extensive list of symptoms and signs means that central anticholinergic syndrome is a potential diagnosis in patients with just about any form of neurological abnormality, and that the incidence could be inversely proportional to the rigour with which other diagnoses are excluded. In some settings, rigorous exclusion of all other conditions may be simply impossible in the immediate post-operative period. The diagnosis, therefore, is heavily dependent on a response to physostigmine, whose central effects extend beyond the cholinergic system [7,8]. Perhaps central anticholinergic syndrome is a misnomer, and central physostigmine responsive syndrome is a more accurate description. This does not mean that post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome should be dismissed out of hand. The case report by Sun [9] cannot easily be explained by any other diagnosis. This is a report of three general anaesthetics in one patient, who took 14 and 10 h to regain full consciousness after repair of retinal detachment under general anaesthesia that included reversal of neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine and atropine. On the third occasion, an identical anaesthetic to the second was given but without reversal of neuromuscular blockade. This time the patient was fully conscious 10 min after the end of the anaesthesia. Physostigmine was not available in the hospital involved. Physostigmine shortens wakening times after general anaesthesia [10]. However, its duration of action is about 30–60 min after intravenous (i.v.) injection [11] and, in common with other 'antidotes' such as naloxone and flumazenil, there is a danger of later recurrence of symptoms. Reported side effects of physostigmine in this setting include nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps [10,12,13] and bradycardia and hypotension [13]. It would therefore seem appropriate to avoid treating one drug's side effects with another drug that exposes patients to other risks. We should accept that some patients recover from anaesthesia more slowly than others, and perhaps the safest course of action is to observe and support them during this time. Careful choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs tailored to individual circumstances should reduce the need for prolonged support. Until a more rigid definition is available, preferably supported by a controlled trial, differences in the reported incidence of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome seem likely to continue.

Several newer medications may help stabilize and improve such problems as fluctuating responses to the medication, drug-induced dyskinesias and refractory symptoms. Patients with fluctuating responses that do not respond to adjustments in the carbidopa/levodopa dose may benefit from the addition of a direct-acting dopamine agonist, such as pergolide or bromocriptine. While carbidopa/levodopa and the direct-acting dopamine agonists have a proven track record as symptomatic treatment, they probably do not alter the pathologic process underlying this progressive condition.

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Synthetic Cannabinoids and Dysphonia: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SC) have been increasing in popularity throughout the past decade, and are now mainstream drugs of abuse. Undetectable by many urine drug screens, SC are a heterogeneous group of chemicals with various documented side effects including myocardial infarctions, tachycardia, agitation, psychosis, nausea, and vomiting. Methods: In this case report, we present a 38 year-old female with dysphonia secondary to SC. Our patient developed dysphonia after 2.5 years of regular SC use. She was thoroughly evaluated by her primary care physician and referred to both, otorhinolaryngology and pulmonology, with an exhaustively negative workup. Her dysphonia persisted for 13 months and only improved after she abstained from using SC. Conclusions and Significance: We could find no previous cases of dysphonia or hoarseness attributed t SC use/ abuse in the literature and is yet another kind of health sequelae frontline providers should look for in chronic users of SC. The previously unrecognized relationship between SC and dysphonia demonstrates our limited understanding of the chemicals’ adverse effects. Just as nicotine affects the larynx and causes dysphonia and laryngeal carcinoma, this case also raises the question of whether the chemical composition of SC affects the larynx in the same way and its use leads to an increased risk of laryngeal cancer for users/abusers",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY A group of 459 children having episodic attacks of headache or abdominal pain, or both, associated with autonomic disturbances such as pallor, sweating, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dizziness, light‐headedness, lethargy and temperature alterations are reported. These symptoms are grouped together into a specific syndrome because of the consistent pattern of the symptoms and clinical findings and because of the consistent presence of particular electroencephalographic abnormality (the 14 and 6/sec positive spike pattern). The majority of these cases occur in children between the ages of 5 and 16 years, occasional cases being seen in younger or older children and adults. In most of the patients no etiology can be demonstrated, although a history of head injury or encephalitis is present in a significant number (37%). These symptoms respond to treatment with anticonvulsant medication, the drugs of choice being dilantin and diamox. RÉSUMÉ Rapport sur l'examen d'un groupe de 459 enfants souffrant d'accès périodiques de maux de tête ou de douleur abdominale, ou des deux à la fois, associés à des troubles autonomes tels que pâleur, transpiration, nausées, vomissements, anorexie, vertiges, sensation de légèreté dans la tête, léthargie et altérations de la température. Ces symptômes sont groupés en un syndrome spécifique à cause du type constant des symptômes et des constatations cliniques, et aussi à cause de la présence constante d'une anomalie électroencéphalographique particulière (le type positif de pointes de 14 et 6/sec). La majorité de ces cas concerne des enfants âgés de 5 à 16 ans; des cas fortuits se sont présentés chez des enfants plus jeunes ou plus âgés et chez des adultes. L'étiologie n'a pu être déterminée chez la plupart des malades, bien qu'une lésion à la tête ou une encéphalite soient mentionnées en un nombre assez important (37%). Ces symptômes réagissent au traitement par des anticonvulsivants; les médicaments à choisir sont le diphénylhydantoïnate de soude et le diamox.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "0998 Duloxetine as a Possible Effective Treatment of Klein-Levin Syndrome Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Kleine Levin Syndrome (KLS), or recurrent hypersomnia, is a rare sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe hyper-somnolence lasting several days to several weeks. Because the etiology is unknown, treatment is mostly supportive. Some pharmacologic agents have been attempted to treat symptoms during episodes with limited success. Report of case(s) Patient is a 17 year-old with a history attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and generalized anxiety disorder who presented to the clinic due to recurrent episodes of severe hypersomnolence associated with derealization and cognitive dysfunction during all episodes, anxiety of being alone, and other symptoms in some episodes such as altered taste affecting appetite, and binge eating. The patient was diagnosed with KLS and tracked episodes which lasted 11-12 days (average) with recurrence every 10-17 days. Labs, 72 hour EEG, MRI and MRA were largely unremarkable. The family declined trial of Lithium. Pharmacogenetic testing showed significant gene-drug interaction with duloxetine requiring higher drug dosage for effects. After psychiatry started duloxetine, the patient experienced a 7 month period without episodes. Then episodes recurred for unclear reason while on duloxetine but with slightly less duration (6-12 days) and shorter time between episodes. Duloxetine was discontinued due to lack of mood effects. Clarithromycin was trialed next for use during episodes without changes. Episodes were tracked for several months with some predictability. Duloxetine was restarted a second time after several months, and the patient showed mild improvement in event duration down to 8-11 days for a few months. Time between episodes also shortened to 8-10 days. Anxiety was only slightly reduced between and during the episodes, though they still continued to struggle with derealization and ability to focus during episodes that effected school and work functioning. Interestingly, they also started to have more insomnia between episodes while on duloxetine. Conclusion KLS is a rare disorder with limited data on effective treatments. To date, this is the first report of a prolonged brief KLS remission with duloxetine. Norepinephrine and serotonin modulation may limit episode duration. More research is needed to determine whether duloxetine can modulate the effects of KLS. Support (if any) None",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced dystonia (DID) is a rarely diagnosed adverse reaction to a sufficiently large number of drugs. Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

Ces stimulus étaient l'apomorphine, l'émétine, la scoline et le choc électrique. Rien n'indique à l'évidence que ces méthodes sont plus efficaces que les autres, non excitantes, pour traiter les alcooliques. L'échec de ces méthodes est parfois attribuable à des modes de conditionnement défectueux. Ainsi, (1) la difficulté qu'on éprouve à régler l'intervalle entre la présentation du stimulus conditionné (SC) (alcool) et la survenance du réflexe non conditionné (RNC) (nausée et vomissements). L'intervalle critique (de 0 à 5 secondes) entre le SC et le RNC est d'une extrême importance dans le conditionnement classique; (2) L'effet hypnotique souvent produit par les drogues productrices de nausées, qui peut rendre difficile le processus du conditionnement. Cependant, même lorsqu'un réflexe de répugnance à l'alcool est bien conditionné, il peut ne pas suffire à produire des modifications du comportement chez le buveur. Rien non plus ne vient prouver l'efficacité thérapeutique particulière du LSD.L'auteur met en lumière la difficulté d'évaluation de la plupart des études passées en revue et il expose les conditions minimales qui président à des études bien faites. Il propose d'accorder plus d'attention, dans la future recherche, aux variables que présentent les sujets et les modes d'administration, ainsi qu'aux méthodes de postcure.",

      "abstract": "Different gastrointestinal symptoms, such as excessive salivation, deterioration and other disorders affecting the teeth, dysphagia, gastroparesis, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, difficult defecation or loss of weight are frequent events in all the stages of the development of Parkinson's disease and affect at least a third of the patients. These symptoms reflect the dysfunction of the enteric nervous system, and the stomach is one of the organs where alpha-synuclein is first deposited. Other factors, such as the dysfunction of structures in the central nervous system like the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve, hormonal factors or secondary effects deriving from the consumption of antiparkinsonian drugs, are involved in its origin. The present article offers a detailed review of the epidemiological, pathophysiological, clinical and therapeutic management aspects of the different gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Gastroparesia y otros sintomas gastrointestinales en la enfermedad de Parkinson.Diferentes sintomas gastrointestinales, como salivacion excesiva, deterioro y otros trastornos de las piezas dentarias, disfagia, gastroparesia, reflujo gastroesofagico, estreñimiento, dificultades en la defecacion o perdida de peso, son frecuentes en todos los estadios evolutivos de la enfermedad de Parkinson y afectan al menos a un tercio de los pacientes. Estos sintomas reflejan la disfuncion del sistema nervioso enterico, siendo el estomago uno de los organos donde mas precozmente se deposita la alfa-sinucleina. Otros factores, como la disfuncion de estructuras del sistema nervioso central como el nucleo motor dorsal del nervio vago, factores hormonales o efectos secundarios derivados del consumo de farmacos antiparkinsonianos estan implicados en su origen. El presente articulo revisa en detalle aspectos epidemiologicos, fisiopatologicos, clinicos y de manejo terapeutico de los diferentes sintomas gastrointestinales en la enfermedad de Parkinson.",

      "abstract": "Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) can present with hyperkinetic movement disorders. Occasionally, the movements are complex, posing a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. A 57-year-old woman with seronegative NMOSD of three years duration presented with involuntary, non-rhythmic, non-suppressible, purposeless movements affecting the right upper extremities. The movements were accompanied by weakness, numbness, and impaired proprioception. The hyperkinetic movements were noted more with postural maintenance varying in speed and amplitude. The movements were complex and did not solely meet the classic definition of tremor, myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia. Cervical MRI showed an ill-defined hyperintense intramedullary lesion at C1-C6 compared to the previously affected at C1-C2 levels hence, relapse of her NMOSD was considered. Initial treatment with anti-epileptic medications, haloperidol, and muscle relaxants did not control symptoms. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was given for five days but offered partial improvement. The treatment was followed by 30-day oral fingolimod immunotherapy as the unconventional treatment for the refractory disease. After treatment, complete remission of the hyperkinetic movement disorders and the moto-sensory deficit was observed. The temporal association of the therapy and resolution of symptoms is speculative as it may have resolved over a month, as expected in an acute spinal movement disorder. This report highlights the importance of recognizing \"spinal movement disorders\" associated with NMOSD that can be complex and diagnostically challenging in a setting of exacerbation. The purported mechanism includes voluntary compensation for weakness and a consequence of sensory deafferentation of the proprioceptive feedback mechanism. Limited therapeutic options lie in the underlying etiology; hence early identification leads to appropriate therapy and a better outcome.",

      "title": "Treatment Options for Acute Agitation in Psychiatric Patients: Theoretical and Empirical Evidence",
      "abstract": "Acute agitation is a common presenting symptom in the emergency ward and is also dealt with on a routine basis in psychiatry. Usually a symptom of an underlying mental illness, it is considered urgent and immediate treatment is indicated. The practice of treating agitation on an acute care basis is also referred to as rapid tranquilization. A variety of psychotropic drugs and combinations thereof can be used. The decision is usually made based on availability and the clinician’s experience, with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol (alone or in combination with antihistaminergic and anticholinergic drugs such as promethazine), the benzodiazepines lorazepam, diazepam and midazolam as well as a variety of atypical antipsychotics being used for this purpose. Haloperidol is associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (which can be controlled by co-administration of promethazine) and may control agitation without inducing sedation, while benzodiazepines have a more pronounced sedating activity. The atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole and ziprasidone are better tolerated, while olanzapine is also a powerful sedative. Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of different treatment options have been conducted but they are extremely heterogenous and most have numerous methodological flaws, leading to a poor overall quality of evidence upon which guidelines for the appropriate treatment could be based. The combination of haloperidol and promethazine, which combines the sedative properties of the antihistamine with the more selective calming action of haloperidol (with a reduced risk of extrapyramidal effects compared to haloperidol alone because of the anticholinergic properties of promethazine) may be the best choice based on empirical evidence.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurotoxic effect of medications. Antineoplastic agents and antiretroviral medications are most often involved: platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids, taxols and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. These agents cause a dose-related axonal polyneuropathy. Symptoms are indicative of a predominantly sensory or sensory-motor neuropathy which in some cases is accompanied by dysfunction of autonomic nervous system. Depending on dosage and agent used symptoms resolve completely or not. Neurotoxic effect can appear immediately during or shortly after administration of the drug but sometimes after cessation of chemotherapy. In all cases the neuropathy alters the quality of life. A general predisposition for developing a neuropathy has been observed in nerves previously damaged by diabetes mellitus, alcohol or in inherited neuropathy. Within the past five years, some cases of neuropathy caused by alpha-interferon, statins or tacrolimus have been reported. Although rare, these aetiologies should be considered by physicians and the drugs removed when others causes of neuropathy have been excluded. Few cases of peripheral neuropathy have been recently reported with metronidazole, dapsone, nitrofurantoin or colchicin. Thalidomide induces a dose-dependant sensori-motor length-dependent axonal neuropathy. It should be judiciously used with close neurologic monitorin. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the development of neuropathy. Up to now, no drug is available to prevent or cure drug-induced neuropathies.",

Movement disorders can be classified into four broad categories based on phenomenological features, clinical pharmacology, and neuropathology. It includes hypokinetic disorders identical to Parkinsonism's syndrome, hyperkinetic/choreic movement disorders, tremors, and myoclonus. The cause-and-effect relationship between the drug and the movement disorder is poorly understood, but preexisting central nervous system (CNS) pathology likely predisposes to the development of movement disorders. Commonly prescribed medications that result in movement disorders include antiepileptics, neuroleptics, stimulants, oral contraceptives, antihistaminics and anticholinergics, and antidepressants. The use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors is associated with tremors and less often with myoclonic jerks. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, imipramine, and nortriptyline cause choreiform movements infrequently, particularly orofacial dyskinesia.",

      "title": "Design and Synthesis of Dopaminergic Agonists",
      "abstract": "The use of dopaminergic agonists is key in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative disorders. Despite there are a number of commercialized dopaminergic agonists that are currently being used successfully in the first stages of the disease, they often fail to provide sustained clinical benefit for a long period due to the appearance of side-effects such as augmentation, sleepiness, nausea, hypothension, and compulsive behaviors among others. New dopaminergic agonists with less side effects are being developed. These novel compounds offer an alternative when the disease progresses and patients fail to respond to standard dopaminergic treatments or side-effects increased. Chemistry, and in particular chemical synthesis, has played a major role in bringing synthetic dopaminergic agonists to the clinic and continues to be crucial for the development of new and necessary drugs for long-term treatments with less undesired side effects. A number of structural modifications of parent compounds have led to enhanced agonism but also partial agonism or even antagonism of one or more dopamine receptors. In some cases, these activities are accompanied by agonist effect at serotonin receptors which suggests a potential clinical application in the treatment of schizophrenia In this review, chemical synthesis of dopaminergic agents, their affinity, and the corresponding agonist/antagonist effects will be highlighted.

      "title": "Lıngual Dystonıa Related to the use of Cınnarızıne",
      "abstract": "Cinnarizine is a selective calcium channel blocker and is also similar to neuroleptic drugs with its antihistaminic, antiserotoninergic, and antidopaminergic activity. Some patients develop many side effects while using this drug, including drowsiness, asthenia, depression, or movement disorders such as parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. Depression is a very common side effect of this drug, and it is thought as movement disorder.[1–4] The exact pathophysiological mechanism that causes movement disorder is not clear, but it is thought that D2 receptor blockade may be responsible, as in neuroleptics.[5] This case is important to draw attention to acute lingual dystonia, which is a rare side effect after chronic use of cinnarizine, and to emphasize that it can be reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. A seventy-year-old male patient was evaluated due to the complaint of difficulty in speaking due to contraction of his tongue for 15–20 days (video imaging). The patient had a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, and there was no obvious feature in his family history. His physical examination was normal, and he did not identify any gingival or tooth loss. A neurological examination of the patient, who was being used 75 mgr/day cinnarizine for 7 years, did not reveal any abnormality other than involuntary tongue contractions. The treatment of cinnarizine was started with the diagnosis of Meniere. Although he tried to stop the drug for a short time, he started again after her complaints increased and he had been using it regularly for a long time. The other drugs he used were candesartan and levothyroxine. The blood tests were normal, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal. The patient was thought to be a case of drug-induced lingual dystonia. The cinnarizine treatment stopped immediately, and after about three weeks, the patient completely recovered. Drug-induced movement disorders are a condition that can be overlooked in practice. It usually occurs after the use of dopaminergic blockers or neuroleptics. Other drugs causing lingual dystonia reported in the literature are metoclopramide, olanzapine, lithium, haloperidol, anticancer drug capecitabine, risperidone, aripiprazole, cyclizine, meperidine, cisapride, and pimozide.[6–8] Movement disorders due to chronic use of cinnarizine develop slowly and are often overlooked.[1] A wide range of drugs such as antiemetics, drugs used for dizziness (calcium channel blockers), or neuroleptic drugs can cause drug-induced movement disorder. While the disorder in the dopamine pathway is held responsible for the pathophysiology, D2 receptor blockade is the main cause.[5] Additionally, they reduce dopamine neurotransmission. These effects may depend on some factors, including age, penetration across the blood-brain barrier, and types of calcium channels present in the different neuronal subtypes.[9] While acute reactions and dystonia are common in young patients, tardive or chronic reactions are common in elderly patients. Parkinsonism is the most common movement disorder. Parkinsonian symptoms were only seen in patients older than 50 years. The risk is higher in women. Patients treated for >6 months had significantly larger reductions than patients treated for a shorter period. In the study of Brucke et al.,[6] symptoms started after 16 months In the study of Gimenes et al.,[10] this period was 4 years. In the literature, movement disorders such as cinnarizine-induced parkinsonism, tardive dystonia, and akathisia reported, but lingual dystonia has not been observed.[1,2] Tongue myorhythmia and lingual tremor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dystonic tongue movements. Tremor is defined as the rhythmic and oscillatory involuntary movement of a body part of relatively constant frequency and variable amplitude, resulting from alternating or synchronized contractions of antagonist muscles. The frequency of tongue tremor (4–8 Hz) was identical to a hand tremor. Myokymia is an uncommon movement disorder that is characterized by slow, rhythmic, and repetitive jerky movements of 1–4 Hz frequency, involving the cranial or limb muscles. In dystonia, the contractions are long-lasting (tonic) and create a posture at the peak of the movement, which is the result of the co-contraction of agonists and antagonists.[11] We report the first case of drug-induced lingual dystonia that developed after long-term use of cinnarizine and was reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.

Objectives Description of a clinical case of a patient diagnosed with major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms and obsessive compulsive disorder prevalence of compulsive acts that do not respond to drug treatment but to electroconvulsive therapy. Methods Presentation and review of a case. Results A 55-year-old woman diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder with worsening in the last 4 years. Clinical depressive Sadness, spontaneous crying in the form of access, apathy, isolation and clinofilia desires, complaints mnemonic deficits and complete anhedonia. Obsessional symptoms compulsive as more repetitive behaviors of obsessive ideas, which repeats incessantly despite checking, that does not prepare or calm. The patient has not responded to any pharmacological strategy, despite using full doses and combinations of antidepressant, but euthymics more antipsychotics (sertraline, fluoxetine, reboxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, risperidone, quetiapine, trifluoperazine, clotiapine). For this reason, it was decided to start treatment with ECT, progressively responds in each session, after 8 sessions the patient is euthymic, it has resumed normal activities, no obsessive or psychotic symptoms. Conclusions It is important to know that it is a safe technique that would save not only an economic cost, if not a personal emotional cost. It is noteworthy that more than 50% of depressed patients who respond to a course of ECT, fall between 6 and 12 months despite receiving adequate pharmacological treatment then so we will have to closely monitor the patient.

It is believed that in such cases and in cases who show unexplained clouding of consciousness a therapeutic trial of nicotinic acid is the only means available by which one can determine whether or not the psychosis is due to avitaminosis. In some exceptional cases, even when clinical evidence of pellagra is absent, extremely large amounts of nicotinic acid are necessary to obtain satisfactory results.",

      "abstract": "Seizures are sudden, transitory, and uncontrolled episodes of brain dysfunction resulting from abnormal discharge of neuronal cells with associated motor, sensory or behavioral changes. Anticonvulsants (also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as ant seizure drugs) are a diverse group of pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the rapid and excessive firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain. Synthesis of starting material by reacting with KOH resulting substituted benzoate obtained then (2.58gm, 10 m mol) DMF (10 ml), hydrazine hydrate (50 m mol) was added give substituted hydrazide product then take methanolic solution of hydrazide product (5.1 m mol), cyanogens bromide (7.5 m mol) was added give oxadiazole derivatives, The purity of all compounds have been checked by the TLC monitoring and the conformation of structure will be checked by different spectra like IR, Mass and NMR, and then evaluated for anti-convulsant activity.

Estos pacientes tambien tienen riesgo de estatus epileptico y a veces es la primera manifestacion de la epilepsia. En este grupo de pacientes, el metabolismo y los efectos secundarios de los medicamentos antiepilepticos es diferente cuando se compara con pacientes mas jovenes. Cuando se prescribe un anticonvulsivante es importante tener en cuenta que muchos de los adultos mayores tienen otras comorbilidades y estan tomando otros medicamentos. Estos principios aplican tambien en el manejo de estado epileptico. Nuevo anticonvulsivantes de uso intravenoso como acido valproico, Levetiracetam y Lacosamida, pueden ser una opcion en el manejo del estado epileptico cuando las medicaciones convencionales estan contraindicadas o no pueden empleadas por sus efectos secundarios. Estos nuevos anticonvulsivantes son tambien utiles en el manejo de estado epileptico de pacientes con otras condiciones medicas como falla hepatica o pacientes en quimioterapia entre otros.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

      "title": "Is the Preoperative Use of Antidepressants and Benzodiazepines Associated with Opioid and Other Analgesic Use After Hip and Knee Arthroplasty?",
      "abstract": "Mental health disorders can occur in patients with pain conditions, and there have been reports of an increased risk of persistent pain after THA and TKA among patients who have psychological distress. Persistent pain may result in the prolonged consumption of opioids and other analgesics, which may expose patients to adverse drug events and narcotic habituation or addiction. However, the degree to which preoperative use of antidepressants or benzodiazepines is associated with prolonged analgesic use after surgery is not well quantified.(1) Is the preoperative use of antidepressants or benzodiazepine medications associated with a greater postoperative use of opioids, NSAIDs, or acetaminophen? (2) Is the proportion of patients still using opioid analgesics 1 year after arthroplasty higher among patients who were taking antidepressants or benzodiazepine medications before surgery, after controlling for relevant confounding variables? (3) Does analgesic drug use decrease after surgery in patients with a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use? (4) Does the proportion of patients using antidepressants or benzodiazepines change after joint arthroplasty compared with before?Of the 10,138 patients who underwent hip arthroplasty and the 9930 patients who underwent knee arthroplasty at Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement, Tampere, Finland, between 2002 and 2013, those who had primary joint arthroplasty for primary osteoarthritis (64% [6502 of 10,138] of patients with hip surgery and 82% [8099 of 9930] who had knee surgery) were considered potentially eligible. After exclusion of another 8% (845 of 10,138) and 13% (1308 of 9930) of patients because they had revision or another joint arthroplasty within 2 years of the index surgery, 56% (5657 of 10,138) of patients with hip arthroplasty and 68% (6791 of 9930) of patients with knee arthroplasty were included in this retrospective registry study. Patients who filled prescriptions for antidepressants or benzodiazepines were identified from a nationwide drug prescription register, and information on the filled prescriptions for opioids (mild and strong), NSAIDs, and acetaminophen were extracted from the same database. For the analyses, subgroups were created according to the status of benzodiazepine and antidepressant use during the 6 months before surgery. First, the proportions of patients who used opioids and any analgesics (that is, opioids, NSAIDs, or acetaminophen) were calculated. Then, multivariable logistic regression adjusted with age, gender, joint, Charlson Comorbidity Index, BMI, laterality (unilateral/same-day bilateral), and preoperative analgesic use was performed to calculate odds ratios for any analgesic use and opioid use 1 year postoperatively. Additionally, the proportion of patients who used antidepressants and benzodiazepines was calculated for 2 years before and 2 years after surgery.At 1 year postoperatively, patients with a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use were more likely to fill prescriptions for any analgesics than were patients without a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use (adjusted odds ratios 1.9 [95% confidence interval 1.6 to 2.2]; p < 0.001 and 1.8 [95% CI 1.6 to 2.0]; p < 0.001, respectively). Similarly, patients with a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use were more likely to fill prescriptions for opioids than patients without a history of antidepressant or benzodiazepine use (adjusted ORs 2.1 [95% CI 1.7 to 2.7]; p < 0.001 and 2.0 [95% CI 1.6 to 2.4]; p < 0.001, respectively). Nevertheless, the proportion of patients who filled any analgesic prescription was smaller 1 year after surgery than preoperatively in patients with a history of antidepressant (42% [439 of 1038] versus 55% [568 of 1038]; p < 0.001) and/or benzodiazepine use (40% [801 of 2008] versus 55% [1098 of 2008]; p < 0.001). The proportion of patients who used antidepressants and/or benzodiazepines was essentially stable during the observation period.Surgeons should be aware of the increased risk of prolonged opioid and other analgesic use after surgery among patients who were on preoperative antidepressant and/or benzodiazepine therapy, and they should have candid discussions with patients referred for elective joint arthroplasty about this possibility. Further studies are needed to identify the most effective methods to reduce prolonged postoperative opioid use among these patients.Level III, therapeutic study.",

We present a patient treated for Parkinson's disease in whom during the period of levodopa wearing off we observed a paroxysmal abdominalgia apart from other features of a typical movement disorders like: increasing rigidity, gait disturbances and tremor. Abdominalgia consisted of stomach cramps, with variable localization in epi-, meso- and hypogastrium. Rectal tenesmus was also present. The patient was treated with analgesics, spasmolytics and carminative drugs with no effect. Abdominal pains regressed after an intake of the next levodopa dose. The patient presented with other features of a gastrointestinal tract autonomic system dysfunction like: chronic constipation, preterm satiety resulting in food intake reduction and a decrease in body weight. There was no organic lesions of the gastrointestinal system that could explain such disturbances. Pharmacologic treatment modification (more frequent levodopa dosage, additional dopamine agonist) resulted in some improvement.

Many of the same effects are reported in normals after harmine and Nalline (other workers). unlike mescaline and LSD at usual dosage levels, the present psychotomimetics regularly produce drowsiness and sleep along with the aberrant mental effects. The resultant state is partly that of \"hypnagogic\" visual hallucinations or imagery. The results with increased dosage suggest that the basic effect of these agents is to produce an acute toxic reaction type. The difference between them and mescaline or LSD with respect to clouding of consciousness and certain aspects of the hallucinogenic response may be quantitative rather than qualitative. The indole nucleus is not necessary in the structure of psychotomimetics since Win-2299 and Nalline are non-indoles.

The latter should be carefully studied because the side effects are numerous and many drugs potentiate others. Some are very toxic to the liver.

      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "title": "Should We Use Psychostimulant Drugs to Boost the Emergence from General Anesthesia?",
      "abstract": "Recently, Chemali et al. 1showed that psychostimulants can accelerate the emergence from propofol anesthesia as evidenced by a faster recovery of the righting reflex and by signs of electroencephalogram activation after the injection of methylphenidate during propofol infusion. The authors believe that methylphenidate can be safely used in a clinical setting to facilitate the awakening from prolonged propofol anesthesia or in patients overly sedated by propofol. In our view, the use of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate as emergence drugs may lead to undesirable consequences, especially in the abovementioned subsets of patients.It has been recently suggested that sequential activation of consciousness, connectedness to the environment, and responsiveness may be prerequisites for the smooth and uneventful emergence from anesthesia.2Switching on the connectedness or responsiveness before the consciousness is fully recovered from the effect of GABAergic drugs may be a cause of cognitive dysfunction or even delirium on emergence.2,3Although connectedness to external stimuli is likely to rely on norepinephrinergic signaling,4responsiveness probably requires the engagement of the basal ganglia and is subject to dopaminergic modulation in the striatum.5Methylphenidate can increase extracellular levels of both norepinephrine and dopamine in cortical and subcortical areas.6–9We believe that administering methylphenidate during propofol infusion or immediately after its termination and before the anesthetic is eliminated and consciousness sufficiently restored would interrupt the natural sequential switching-on of consciousness–connectedness–responsiveness and may result in postoperative cognitive dysfunction.We also suspect that accelerated emergence in otherwise uncomplicated anesthesia cases may be unpleasant, similar to sudden and forced awakening from sleep.10The authors themselves noticed that the electroencephalogram pattern after methylphenidate injection during propofol infusion was not exactly a return to a normal awake state: rather, the electroencephalogram showed signs of overactivation.1Administration of methylphenidate at doses comparable to those used in this study causes an increase in locomotion in rats.11,12If the authors had examined the behavior of rats awakened from anesthesia by methylphenidate and compared it with that of animals allowed to naturally awaken from propofol, they would probably have found increased locomotor activity in the former group. The human equivalent of rat hyperlocomotion may be restlessness and agitation, both of which are undesirable and can complicate the postoperative period.Finally, many stimulant drugs with a dopaminergic mechanism of action, including methylphenidate, lead to the so-called rebound hypersomnolence, evidenced by a period of enhanced compensatory sleep after drug-induced waking.13,14For methylphenidate, rebound hypersomnolence occurs at about 3 h after its intraperitoneal administration in rats.14It is unclear whether this phenomenon could be potentiated by residual sedation after propofol anesthesia. However, such potentiation is likely to occur and may have detrimental effects in overly sedated patients and, therefore, should be examined before the drug is used in humans.In conclusion, the results of the study by Chemali et al . certainly enrich our knowledge about the mechanisms of anesthesia and prepare us for possible drug interactions in patients on methylphenidate scheduled for surgery. However, before proceeding to examine the ability of methylphenidate to accelerate the emergence from propofol anesthesia in patients, especially in those with increased drug-induced GABAergic tone, it seems prudent to investigate the effects of methylphenidate on postanesthetic cognitive function in animals. Meanwhile, we can still rely on the natural emergence from anesthesia caused by physiologic elimination of the anesthetic drug. Fortunately, with the ever-improving pharmacokinetic profiles of modern anesthetic drugs, we do not have to wait too long.*Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan. abpetr@med.niigata-u.ac.jp",

He was treated pharmacologically with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI), clozapine (antipsychotic) and other mood-stabilizers, thus resulting ineffective. Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) finally controlled the violent outbursts. Conclusion: Information including ECT on this type of disorder limits to certain cases.

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "title": "An Initially Unsuspected Case of Baclofen Overdose",
      "abstract": "Intentional or accidental overdose of baclofen can cause central nervous system depression including coma, hypotonia, respiratory depression, and seizures, as well as cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia. These authors report a case of surreptitious baclofen intoxication in a patient with seizures and coma.Baclofen, a derivative of γ-aminobutyric acid, is used for symptomatic relief of skeletal muscle spasm and spasticity, particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis.1 Although its exact mechanism is not fully understood, its main effects at the spinal end of upper motor neurons are thought to cause muscle relaxation. Adverse effects of baclofen at usual doses include drowsiness, headache, dizziness, and, occasionally, orthostatic hypotension.2 Intentional or accidental overdose of this drug can cause profound central nervous system depression, including coma, hypotonia, respiratory depression, seizures, and cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia. Because baclofen is a commonly used antispasticity agent and its use as a recreational drug has been reported,3 clinicians should be ever vigilant for patients who may have overdosed on this medication. We report a case of surreptitious baclofen intoxication in a patient with seizures and coma.A 48-year-old, 80-kg man was transferred from a community hospital and admitted to the general intensive care unit of a referral tertiary care teaching hospital after members of his family found him at home unresponsive and having a grand mal seizure. The patient had no history of seizure disorder and had been seen awake and responsive approximately 2 to 2 ½ hours before the seizure. When found, he was apneic and incontinent of both bladder and bowel. He reportedly had vomited. Emergency responders intubated him at his home.Initial testing upon arrival at the community hospital included a basic metabolic panel (including serum electrolytes and creatinine), complete blood cell count, and liver function tests (including transaminases, albumin, bilirubin, and serum ammonia); all results were within the reference range. Computed tomography of the head showed no evidence of hemorrhage or other abnormality. A urine toxicology screen was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol and benzodiazepines (however, emergency medical personnel had administered diazepam because of continuing seizure activity) and negative for amphetamines, cocaine, barbiturates, and opioids. Blood alcohol level was zero. Vital signs upon admission were within the reference range except for blood pressures, which ranged from 174 to 207 mm Hg systolic and 99 to 119 mm Hg diastolic. These values decreased over the next several hours to normal without treatment.The patient's medical history was significant for a previous back injury for which he had taken pain medications long-term, specifically morphine in the past year, but he had reportedly stopped taking this drug about 1 month before the admission. He was not taking any other known medications at the time of hospitalization. He also had a history of alcohol abuse (he reportedly had quit drinking 8 years earlier). He received no treatment for suspected drug overdose at the outlying hospital.Upon transfer to the intensive care unit at the referral hospital, approximately 8 hours after the onset of the seizure, the patient was nonresponsive to verbal stimuli and manifested a decerebrate posture upon deep pain stimuli. Vital signs were normal, including blood pressure 130/70 mm Hg, heart rate 75/min, and temperature 37.2°C. His pupils were 3 mm in diameter and unresponsive to light. Pulses were +1/4 bilaterally with coolness in the lower extremities. The Babinski sign was negative, and the rest of a physical examination revealed no other abnormalities. The patient had no clonus. The results of repeat laboratory studies in the intensive care unit were within the reference range, including normal serum levels of sodium, creatinine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Results of the initial arterial blood gas analysis of samples obtained while the patient was receiving intermittent mechanical ventilation (fraction of inspired oxygen 0.60, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O, respirations 12/min) were pH 7.40, PCO2 38 mm Hg, PO2 180 mm Hg, bicarbonate 23.3 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation 94%. All other laboratory values were within the reference range. Electroencephalography showed a burst-suppression pattern. The results of a computed tomography angiogram of the head and a lumbar puncture did not indicate any abnormalities.At this point, detailed questioning of the patient's family members and investigation of his medical records were undertaken to determine if he had access to or was exposed to any toxic substance. These inquiries revealed that in the past year he had been prescribed the muscle relaxant baclofen. On the basis of this new information, approximately 12 hours after admission to the intensive care unit and 16 hours after the onset of the seizure, a serum sample was sent to a reference laboratory for determination of the baclofen level. No specific treatment for baclofen overdose, including use of activated charcoal, was initiated.About 24 hours later, movement of the patient's extremities (left greater than right) was noted; the movement was determined to be nonpurposeful. Forty-eight hours later, the patient had a dramatic improvement in consciousness. He became alert and awake with his eyes opened. He was able to follow commands and was extubated about 12 hours later. Upon questioning, he revealed that he had attempted suicide by taking an entire bottle (unknown total quantity) of baclofen. He was eventually transferred to the inpatient psychiatric ward for treatment of major depression. The results of the serum assay for baclofen, which was received about 1 week after the patient's transfer to the psychiatric unit, was 1.2 μg/mL (reference serum level for treatment of spasticity is 0.08–0.4 μg/mL).2Although our patient had baclofen intoxication and, in hindsight, had many of the signs and symptoms associated with baclofen overdose, the correct diagnosis was not suspected until a detailed investigation of his medication history was done. The serum level of baclofen in a blood sample obtained approximately 16 hours after the onset of his signs and symptoms was roughly 3 times the upper limit of the reference range for the drug.2Using MEDLINE, we found only 2 reports4,5 published in the past 25 years on the pharmacokinetics in baclofen overdose. In the first report,4 baclofen pharmacokinetics were determined in a patient after an intentional overdose of 1230 mg; in this case, the elimination half-life was 4.58 hours. In the second report,5 a patient ingested more than 2 g of the drug; in this case, the elimination half-life was 8.6 hours. The authors of the second report did not find evidence of saturable kinetics in baclofen overdose.Interestingly, with chronic oral dosing, baclofen has an elimination half-life of about 6.5 hours.6 On the basis of this information, if we assume that the patient was found after most of the drug had been absorbed and we extrapolate back to the time of ingestion (and assume that maximum plasma concentrations occur about 2 hours after ingestion),1 we can estimate that the peak serum level ranged from 5.2 to 18.2 μg/mL (a standard first-order elimination equation was used for this calculation: CO = C x e−kT). If this estimation is accurate, the patient had a significantly higher serum level than has been usually reported in cases of baclofen overdose, though the pharmacokinetics of this drug in higher doses than those described is not known.3In a case series of adolescent boys who overdosed on baclofen, Perry et al3 noted that serum levels of the drug were linearly correlated with duration of mechanical ventilation. One patient with a serum level of baclofen of 0.85 μg/mL 14 hours after ingestion of the drug required 61 hours of mechanical ventilation. Our patient's serum level at 16 hours after ingestion was higher at 1.2 μg/mL, and correspondingly he required about 100 hours of mechanical ventilation. Of course, serum elimination half-life may not reflect a slower elimination rate from the central nervous system, a situation that may explain a significantly longer time on mechanical ventilation than the toxicokinetic data would suggest.Profound central nervous system depression is a recurring finding in patients who have baclofen poisoning, including a patient who had deep coma with no deep tendon, corneal, or gag reflexes.7 In one case,7 a patient ingested approximately 1800 mg of baclofen in addition to acetaminophen with codeine and oxazepam during an 18-day period. With supportive care, the patient was extubated and fully recovered within a week of the ingestion. A teenager who ingested about 500 mg of baclofen had central nervous system depression and coma, bradycardia, and hypertension.8 With supportive care, he also recovered fully about 48 hours after the ingestion. Other reports9,10 of baclofen overdose describe other cardiac conduction abnormalities such as supraventricular tachycardias, premature atrial contractions, and first-degree heart block. Encephalopathic manifestations, including seizures and respiratory depression, in cases of baclofen overdose also have been reported.11Management of baclofen overdose is primarily supportive. Activated charcoal would be expected to bind to the drug in the gut and is a reasonable course of action. A report12 from Taiwan described the use of hemodialysis in a patient who had been taking baclofen for leg muscle soreness. In this patient, serum levels of baclofen had decreased from 3.84 μg/mL to 0.82 μg/mL after a single 4-hour session of hemodialysis. This case suggests that hemodialysis may be an option for baclofen overdose, though more data are needed to make this procedure a routine recommendation. As our case and other cases illustrate, the prognosis is excellent if adequate supportive care (including mechanical ventilation) is provided.Our patient had many of the features of baclofen overdose described in the literature, including profound coma, seizure activity, hypotonia, and respiratory depression. Our case also highlights the need for a thorough investigation into possible ingestants in a patient with signs and symptoms similar to those of our patient. Baclofen is not routinely detected in urine toxicology screens, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for baclofen overdose in patients with a history of muscle spasms or chronic low back pain.In conclusion, our patient had surreptitious baclofen intoxication. Despite being in a deep coma and having hyporeflexia, respiratory depression, and seizures, he made a complete recovery. Healthcare personnel should consider baclofen overdose in any patient whose history and signs and symptoms are similar to those of our patient.",

[1]Among these syndromes, dystonic reactions are characterized by involuntary contractions in opposing flexor and extensor muscles that produce sustained and fixed abnormal postures, such as oculogyric crises, tongue protrusion, trismus, laryngeal-pharyngeal constriction, torticollis, or bizarre positions of the limbs and the trunk. In the majority of cases, acute dystonia occurs within 1-3 days of initiating treatment or increasing neuroleptic dosages. Surprisingly, there are few cases of dystonic reactions induced by anesthesia in the literature (e.g., narcotics, propofol, diazepam, enflurane, barbiturates)[2-5]and only one in which the relation between acute dystonia and volatile anesthetics was probable. [6]We describe a patient being treated by phenothiazine drug, who experienced severe dystonia during inhalation of sevoflurane.A 19-yr-old man with a history of schizophrenia was scheduled for removal of multiple impacted teeth during general anesthesia. He had been treated by cyamemazine, a phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, in a daily dose of 75 mg for 2 yr, along with 180 mg dihydroergotamine to avoid neuroleptic-induced hypotension. Physical examination showed an anxious but docile, young man with normal vital signs, except for weight excess and gynecomasty. Findings from neurologic examination were normal. The patient had no history of involuntary movements or illicit substance consumption. No recent change was made in neuroleptic dosage, and medications were administrated up to the eve of surgery. Because he was afraid of venipuncture, a single-breath inhaled sevoflurane induction was planned after premedication by oral 5 mg midazolam. The patient was asked to take a deep breath of room air and forcibly exhale to residual volume, at which time a face mask was applied. He took 4 or 5 maximum breaths in a circle system filled with 8% sevoflurane in a 50% N2O-O2mixture and lost consciousness. Approximately 1 min later, a torticollic posturing began to develop, the stiffness rapidly extending to the left trapezius and scalenus muscles. Then, a severe rotation of the head developed, a trismus and an opisthotonus. An intravenous cannula was inserted and muscle spasm resolved with injection of 30 mg atracurium. The trachea was intubated and lungs were mechanically ventilated. During the sustained contraction of the neck and trunk muscles, the lowest oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) value was 87%. No significant changes in arterial pressure and heart rate were noted. Subsequent anesthesia (300 [micro sign]g fentanyl, 0.8% end-tidal isoflurane in 50% N2O-O2) was uneventful. No dystonic reaction was observed during recovery from anesthesia. Findings from postoperative neurologic examination were normal.Neuroleptic treatment is a frequent cause of dystonic movements, although dystonia can be provoked by any lesion in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and thalamus, or can be hereditary. Dystonic movements are characterized by an abnormal pattern of activity seen on the electromyogram, with cocontraction of antagonist muscles and overflow into extraneous muscles. [7]This could be caused by deficient reciprocal inhibition represented at multiple levels of the central nervous system. [8]Such cortical inhibition depends on thalamocortical messages released by the basal ganglia, for which the major role in movement control is to maintain an adequate balance between excitation and inhibition. Dopamine levels in the caudate nucleus and the putamen are clearly involved in the pathophysiology of dystonias. Curiously, the dystonia occurs during hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic states, depending on dopamine relative influence on the direct or indirect striatothalamocortical pathways. [7,9]Moreover, other neurotransmitter mechanisms in the extrapyramidal system may be involved, and the ratios of dopamine:acetylcholine and of dopamine: serotonin blockade are important as well. [10]D2-dopaminereceptor blockade in the basal ganglia is widely believed to be the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes. Halogenated anesthetics do not have any known action on such receptors, but sevoflurane may have interacted with cyamemazine in the current patient by altering a dynamic relation between dopamine receptor blockade and other neurotransmitters in the brain.There are few reports of acute dystonia induced by anesthesia in the literature. Zabani and Vaghadia [4]describe a patient who exhibited a torticollic dystonia during propofol anesthesia, but the cause of this disorder was a focal cerebral trauma. Another case seems to be attributable to enflurane, but it was impossible to exclude pharmacologic interactions between many central drugs in this patient. [2]Stemp and Taswell [6]describe a woman in whom a spastic torticollis developed during isoflurane anesthesia. As our patient, she took antipsychotic drug (chlorpromazine) for a long time. However, dystonia occurred after 50 min of inhaled isoflurane at a 0.55% concentration in 70% N2O-O2, and the patient previously received 50 [micro sign]g fentanyl, 2 mg midazolam, and 250 mg thiopental; a possible interaction between any of these additional drug could not be excluded. In the current patient, acute dystonia occurred in the first minute after inhalation of sevoflurane, and responsibility of these drugs is very likely. However, the role of N2O cannot be precluded.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

The exact mechanism of antidepressant-associated extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) is not known. However, hypotheses including inhibition of dopaminergic function in the nigrostriatal pathway, impaired balance between dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic or cholinergic activity, and serotonergic inhibition of dopaminergic functions in the striatum leading to extrapyramidal side effects have been suggested. The number of cases with torticollis during clomipramine use is low. We wish to draw attention to this rare side effect of clomipramine and to contribute to the literature by presenting a case of torticollis on the 5th day of clomipramine treatment in a 22-year-old male 1 patient1.",

Periodical psychological examinations in order to assess the effects of treatment would be useful to avoid psychic perturbations which could, in the long run, cause severe intellectual and affective maladjustment. RÉSUMÉ Le traitement à base de Zarontin, surtout à forte dose et à certaines périodes critiques du développement de l'enfant (adolescence) est susceptible d'engendrer des troubles psychiques profonds affectant à la fois la sphère intellectuelle et affective. On peut se demander si d'autres médications anti‐comitiales ne produiraient pas chez l'enfant des effets similaires. Des études comparatives objectives restent à faire. En clinique, un contrôle psychologique de l'effet des thérapeutiques s'avère utile si on veut éviter des perturbations psychiques susceptibles d'entraîner à la longue chez l'enfant de graves inadaptations intellectuelles et affectives.",

      "abstract": "Altered scapular motion and altered position during motion have been termed scapular dyskinesis.1 The definition of dyskinesis is the alteration of normal scapular kinematics. \"Dys\" (alteration of) \"kinesis\" (motion) is a general term that reflects loss of normal control of scapular motion. An alternative term that is often used interchangeably is dyskinesia. Dyskinesia is usually applied to abnormal active (voluntary) movements mediated by neurologically controlled factors. The scapular rotations (upward/downward rotation, anterior/posterior tilt, and internal/external rotation) are accessory motions, which by definition are involuntary in nature. The scapular translations can be performed voluntarily, but there are times when the scapula translates during arm motion without conscious consideration from the individual person. In addition to these motion distinctions, there are many other factors that can cause the altered scapular position and motion, such as bony injury (clavicle fractures, acromioclavicular joint separations), soft tissue disruption (scapular muscle detachments), and internal derangement (labral injury, compromised capsular tissue). Therefore, the more inclusive term dyskinesis is preferred.",

      "title": "LMNB1-Related Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LMNB1-related autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a slowly progressive disorder of central nervous system white matter characterized by onset of autonomic dysfunction in the fourth to fifth decade, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar abnormalities resulting in spasticity, ataxia, and tremor. Autonomic dysfunction can include bladder dysfunction, constipation, postural hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and (less often) impaired sweating. Pyramidal signs are often more prominent in the lower extremities (e.g., spastic weakness, hypertonia, clonus, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilateral Babinski signs). Cerebellar signs typically appear at the same time as the pyramidal signs and include gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysmetria, and nystagmus. Many individuals have sensory deficits starting in the lower limbs. Pseudobulbar palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and forced crying and laughing may appear in the seventh or eighth decade. Although cognitive function is usually preserved or only mildly impaired early in the disease course, dementia and psychiatric manifestations can occur as late manifestations. Affected individuals may survive for decades after onset. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LMNB1-related ADLD is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and MRI findings and either an LMNB1 duplication or (more rarely) a heterozygous deletion upstream of the LMNB1 promoter identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. For autonomic dysfunction: Neurogenic bladder may require management of urinary retention and/or urgency and recurrent urinary tract infection. Constipation may require good hydration, increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and/or laxatives. Orthostatic hypotension can be minimized by pharmacologic intervention, compression stockings, physical therapy, and increased dietary salt. Erectile dysfunction is treated medically. Impaired sweating is managed with cool environment and attention to fever during infection. Spasticity may be treated with medications and physical therapy. Ataxia can be managed with strategies to minimize falls and increase strength, and adaptive equipment such as walkers or wheelchairs. Feeding difficulties can be managed with speech therapy and appropriate feeding interventions to assure adequate nutrition while preventing aspiration pneumonia. Surveillance: Routine assessment of: weight, nutrition, and feeding; pulmonary status (re possible recurrent pneumonia); bladder and erectile function; psychosocial well-being; and medications/doses to avoid iatrogenic polypharmacy. At least yearly assessment: by a neurologist for disease manifestations and progression; and by a physiatrist, orthopedist, physical therapist, and occupational therapist to address orthopedic, equipment, and functional needs. Genetic counseling LMNB1-related ADLD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all individuals diagnosed with LMNB1-related ADLD whose parents have undergone molecular genetic testing have the disorder as the result of a large LMNB1 duplication (or a deletion upstream of LMNB1) inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with LMNB1-related ADLD has a 50% chance of inheriting the LMNB1 duplication (or deletion upstream of LMNB1). Once the causative pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for LMNB1-related ADLD are possible.",

      "title": "Aspects of Tolerability of Centrally Acting Antihypertensive Drugs",
      "abstract": "Traditional centrally acting antihypertensives have been associated with a high incidence of adverse effects and are no longer recommended as first-line therapy. The newer imidazoline receptor agonists must overcome this reputation if they are to gain recognition as potential first-line agents for hypertension. Methyldopa, a centrally acting alpha(2)-agonist, is characterized by a number of serious adverse reactions that limit its use. Although unpredictable idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity reactions are uncommon, these include hepatitis, myocarditis, and hemolytic anaemia. Less serious problems such as abnormal liver function tests, positive Coombs test, drug-induced fever, and pancreatitis also occur. Central side effects include drowsiness, fatigue, lethargy, sedation, depression, psychotic reactions, nasal stuffiness, impotence, and exacerbation of Parkinsonism. In hypertensive men, methyldopa is less well tolerated than either captopril or propranolol, and up to 20% of patients discontinue therapy because of adverse effects. Clonidine acts primarily as an alpha(2)-agonist but also acts as an agonist at imidazoline receptors in the rostroventrolateral medulla. It is equipotent to most other antihypertensives but is considerably less well-tolerated in comparative trials. The principal adverse effects of clonidine are drowsiness, sedation, lethargy and dry mouth. Reserpine acts primarily by depleting central catecholamine neurotransmitter stores. It was very extensively used in early hypertension trials, but its central side effects of sedation, nasal stuffiness, and severe depression are now considered so undesirable that the drug is seldom prescribed. The imidazoline (I1) agonists moxonidine and rilmenidine act selectively and have very little central alpha(2)-agonist activity. In comparative studies against placebo and other reference antihypertensives, the only adverse effect consistently associated with these drugs was dry mouth (approximate placebo-corrected incidence 10%). Sedation was not pronounced. Withdrawal syndromes are complex pathophysiologic processes and occur with a variety of antihypertensive drugs. Cessation of therapy with clonidine and, to a lesser extent, methyldopa may result in a severe withdrawal syndrome characterized by restlessness, sweating, anxiety, tremor, palpitations, and headache. There may be a rapid rise in blood pressure, often with a true \"rebound\" to higher than pretreatment levels. Plasma and urinary catecholamine levels are increased, and fatalities have been reported. It is important to stress that such a syndrome has not been recorded, in animal or human studies, with either moxonidine or rilmenidine.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The problem of antiepileptic drug interactions is significant in that many epileptic patients are treated with multiple drug therapy. Moreover, patients may also be receiving additional medication for other concurrent disorders. Most drug interactions are pharmacokinetic, involving changes in absorption, protein binding, metabolism, or excretion. As a result, plasma levels of the antiepileptic drug may decrease leading to exacerbation of seizures. Alternatively, plasma levels may rise resulting in toxic side effects. Similar changes may also occur with drugs given for other disorders. In this paper, possible mechanisms of drug interactions are discussed. This is followed by a description of clinically significant interactions involving phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, valproic acid, benzodiazepines, and succinimides. Potentially serious drug interactions may be minimized by using as few medications as possible and by regularly monitoring plasma levels of antiepileptic drugs.",

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

      "abstract": "Seizures can occur at stroke onset, early in its course or as a remote complication. Certain types of stroke are associated with an increased risk of seizures, namely hemorrhagic strokes, large and disabling ischemic strokes and those with cortical lesions. Seizures recur (post-stroke epilepsy) more commonly in patients who experienced early seizures, and in those with severe strokes, cortical infarctions and lobar hemorrhages. Seizures and status epilepticus can cause death in the acute phase, but they do not have a independent influence in long-term functional outcome. There is limited evidence concerning the optimal treatment options for post-stroke seizures, namely which antiepileptics should be used, or when treatment should begin or end. Phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate are possible choices. New antiepileptic drugs can be used in patients who do not tolerate classic antiepileptic drugs and in those who fail treatment.",

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect.

      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation.

      "title": "When Duzitol Does Not Do It All",
      "abstract": "The range of effects that are part of a clinically adequate state of general anesthesia are hypnosis (loss of appropriate response to verbal command), amnesia (lack of recall of intraoperative events), analgesia or pain relief along with blunting of the adrenergic response to noxious stimuli, and suppression of movement in response to noxious stimuli. These effects are produced by distinct pharmacologic actions even when they are produced by one drug.1 In their 1992 editorial, Shafer and Stanski provided the pharmacokinetic profile of a fictitious IV-administered anesthetic, Duzitol (a combination amnestic, hypnotic, analgesic, and muscle relaxant).2 Unfortunately, such an IV anesthetic has yet to be introduced into clinical practice. The IV-administered anesthetic agents that are available are drugs that have an affinity for specific receptors and, unless given in very high doses, produce very specific effects. Therefore, to produce a clinically adequate state of general anesthesia with the drugs in the contemporary anesthetic armamentarium, drugs from at least 2 different classes must be used in combination. When drugs are used in combination, their effect can be infra-additive (i.e., antagonistic), additive, or supra-additive (i.e., synergistic). Antagonistic interactions generally involve deliberate reversal of the effects on one drug by another (e.g., flumazenil reversal of the effects of a benzodiazepine).3 Additive interactions are typically observed when drugs exert their effect through interaction with the same receptors or receptor subtypes (e.g., minimum alveolar concentration [MAC] additivity of inhalation anesthetics), whereas synergistic interactions are observed when drugs produce their effects by different or slightly different mechanisms.3,4 One method to graphically present drug interactions is by using an isobologram.5 The 2 axes of the isobologram ideally represent the effect-site concentrations of the 2 drugs of interest (Fig. 1). The line on the graph represents the drug concentration pairs that elicit the same response. Infra-additive interactions are represented by a line that curves away from the graph origin (zero–zero concentration point); adding a second drug at a low concentration requires a higher concentration of the first drug to elicit the same response. If the drug interaction is additive, the x- and y-axis intercepts are connected by a negative-sloping straight line. Finally, with a synergistic relationship, the interaction line is curved toward the graph origin, which is equivalent to a left shift of the first drug's concentration–response curve. Synergy, then, is the addition of a low concentration of a second drug to a greatly reduced concentration of the first drug to attain the same response. In their analysis of the literature on anesthetic drug interactions, Hendrickx et al. concluded that opioids interact synergistically with not only volatile anesthetics but also IV-administered hypnotics.4 Unfortunately, drug interactions can be a double-edged sword; synergy is often observed for both the desirable aspects of anesthesia or sedation and undesirable side effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular depression; little is known or has been studied about these latter interactions.3,4Figure 1: This graph is an isobolographic cartoon of the various categories of drug interactions. Drug interactions can be antagonistic (infra-additive), additive, or synergistic (supra-additive).4 , 5 Antagonistic and synergistic interactions can have various amounts of bowing away from or toward the line of additivity, respectively. The curves can also be symmetric (as shown for the antagonistic interaction) or can be skewed toward one or the other axes (as shown for the synergistic interaction). The concentrations depicted on the graph axes are arbitrary values and not representative of any particular drugs.Volatile anesthetics can produce a clinically adequate state of general anesthesia with a single drug. When the volatile anesthetic is classified as an immobilizer, the MAC of that drug can be determined as the minimum brain-equilibrated alveolar concentration that prevents half of those tested from moving in response to a noxious stimulus (i.e., the median concentration). Although opioids can significantly reduce the MAC of a volatile anesthetic, there is no dose of an opiate alone that will prevent movement; there is always a low concentration of the volatile anesthetic required to achieve MAC (synergy by definition).4 In the same way, high concentrations of a sedative/hypnotic can be used to provide anesthesia as long as ventilation of the subject is assured. However, the recovery from such an anesthetic can be quite prolonged. High concentrations of any drug may also increase the incidence of unwanted side effects. In an effort to minimize side effects and hasten anesthetic recovery, a balanced anesthetic is preferred. A balanced anesthetic takes advantage of the primary effect of each drug by matching each component of the anesthetic to the effect of a single drug. To this end, the sedative/hypnotic assures lack of recall, muscle relaxants prevent movement, and the opioids blunt the adrenergic response and reflex movement to noxious stimuli while providing pain relief on emergence. Moderate to deep sedation as a part of monitored anesthesia care (the other MAC) has different goals and almost never includes a volatile anesthetic. The patient is expected to maintain adequate spontaneous ventilation and oxygenation; assisted ventilation or the insertion of an airway device becomes a general anesthetic by definition. It is particularly important for the patient to maintain spontaneous ventilation or respond to prompts to breathe when the patient is undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and the anesthesia caregiver must “share” the airway. Typically during sedation, the nociceptive input is at least partially blocked by local infiltration or topical application of a local anesthetic. When the noxious stimuli are not completely blocked, an analgesic or higher doses of sedative/hypnotics are required. By making use of the interaction of sedatives and analgesics, the dose of each can be lowered; hence, a more rapid recovery can be realized. If the 2 drugs being used have a synergistic effect, large dose reductions of each can be accomplished. However, synergy of adverse effects, including respiratory depression, can also occur. In this issue of Anesthesia & Analgesia, LaPierre et al. have looked at the combined effect of a sedative/hypnotic and an opioid in blunting the responses to esophageal instrumentation, which is likened to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.6 The aim of their study was to “explore selected effects of combinations of remifentanil–propofol effect-site concentrations that lead to a loss of response to esophageal instrumentation (blunt-end bougie insertion; positive outcome), along with a loss of responsiveness, and/or the onset of intolerable ventilatory depression (negative outcomes).” A secondary aim was to create response surface models (3-dimensional [D] isobolographic interactions) for each of the 3 observed effects. The authors hypothesized that they could determine selected effect-site concentrations of the combination of remifentanil and propofol that would permit esophageal instrumentation in a high percentage of these volunteers while avoiding loss of responsiveness or intolerable ventilatory depression. They also hypothesized that the interaction of propofol and remifentanil would be synergistic. When administering an anesthetic, we strive to attain our goal in more than half or, preferably, >99% of our patients. Indeed, in the article by LaPierre et al. the authors include isobolograms for the 5% and 95% responses in addition to that for 50% (their Fig. 2, A and C, and Fig. 3).6 But what if you are interested in other response percentages? The Utah anesthesia research group frequently and effectively uses response surfaces to illustrate their interactive data. A response surface is a 3-D rendition of the more common (2-D) isobologram, which illustrates the response of a group of subjects to various concentration combinations of 2 drugs.7 A response surface is a 3-axis plot of the isobolographic response with the third (vertical) axis representing the percentage of responders (or nonresponders) as a continuous function (LaPierre et al.'s Fig. 2, B and D). The surface is particularly useful in illustrating the transition zone separating responders from nonresponders. Individual isobolograms can be illustrated on the surface as a subset of the continuous relationship.Figure 2: This is a graph of the effect-site concentration history of propofol resulting from a rapid infusion of 0.8 mg · kg−1 given over 1 minute immediately followed by a constant rate infusion of 83 μg · kg−1 · min−1 until 120 minutes. The effect-site concentration is within 10% of the 2.0 μg · mL−1 target for the first 60 minutes, at which time a new lower-rate infusion should be initiated.Figure 3: This is a graph of the effect-site concentration history of remifentanil resulting from a rapid infusion of 0.15 mg · kg−1 given over 1 minute immediately followed by a constant rate infusion of 0.03 μg · kg−1 · min−1 until 120 minutes. The effect-site concentration rises to a value of 0.9 ng · mL−1 at 75 minutes. A larger initial infusion would, obviously, produce this concentration sooner with the risk of higher initial concentrations.Comparing the results of LaPierre et al.6 to those of Lallo et al.8 reveals a very interesting similarity. In the Lallo et al. study the authors compared the predicted effect-site concentrations of propofol to those of remifentanil when each drug was administered alone, as the only “sedative” for nasotracheal intubation. They found that the propofol group lacked recall and would breathe spontaneously, but were more likely to display an uncooperative response to noxious stimulation. The remifentanil group could typically recall events, were cooperative, and would appropriately respond to reminders to breathe. Similar results can be gleaned from Figure 1A in the study by LaPierre et al.6 If the preferential endpoint is loss of response to esophageal instrumentation and no intolerable ventilatory depression, there are 2 groups of concentration pairs that could be acceptable. One group, along the propofol axis, is the combination of effect-site concentrations of propofol of 1.5 to 2.7 μg · mL−1 and remifentanil up to 0.8 ng · mL−1. The other group, along the remifentanil axis, has effect-site concentrations of remifentanil of 3 to 4 ng · mL−1 and propofol up to 0.6 μg · mL−1. The authors state that there appears to be a region of low remifentanil (0 to 1.5 ng · mL−1) and high propofol (4 to 6 μg · mL−1) concentrations in which there is a high probability (>80% to 95%) of loss of response to esophageal instrumentation and a moderate probability (40% to 70%) of intolerable ventilatory depression. There is no “sweet spot” (LaPierre et al.'s Fig. 3) for which there is greater than a 95% probability of loss of response to esophageal instrumentation and less than a 5% probability of intolerable ventilatory depression.6 However, the authors did find that 2 to 3 μg · mL−1 of propofol and 0.8 ng · mL−1 of remifentanil blocked the response to esophageal instrumentation and avoided intolerable ventilatory depression in a majority of volunteers. Clinical application of the predicted effective concentrations derived in these studies is particularly problematic for anesthesia practitioners in the United States who do not, as yet, have access to target-controlled infusions other than in a research setting. We are more accustomed to thinking in terms of infusion rates than in terms of plasma or effect-site concentrations. Therefore, to provide a more familiar reference, we have used the Schnider (propofol)9,10 and Minto (remifentanil)11 models to simulate a bolus-infusion regimen that will attain effect-site concentrations near the optimum concentration pairs as determined by LaPierre et al.6 For propofol, 0.8 mg · kg−1 (56 mg/70 kg) infused over 1 minute followed by a 83 μg · kg−1 · min−1 infusion will attain and maintain an effect-site concentration within 10% of 2 μg · mL−1 for the first 60 minutes of the infusion (Fig. 2). For remifentanil, 0.15 μg · kg−1 infused over 1 minute (10 μg/70 kg) followed by a 0.03 μg · kg−1 · min−1 infusion will attain and maintain an effect-site concentration of about 0.9 ng · mL−1 (Fig. 3). A larger-bolus dose would obviously obtain this concentration sooner with the risk of higher initial concentrations. These simulations were performed using SAAM II software and the aforementioned model parameters (SAAM Institute, Seattle, WA). We can conclude that the adverse synergy of adding remifentanil to propofol, resulting in the negative endpoints of loss of responsiveness, intolerable respiratory depression, or both, outweighed the positive synergy gained by adding remifentanil. It would seem that the use of either propofol alone (the patient will breath spontaneously despite loss of response to verbal stimuli) or remifentanil alone (the patient is able to respond to prompts to breathe), as demonstrated by Lallo et al.,8 may be the preferred method of sedation. The message must be heard loud and clear by all proceduralists. If they are performing a procedure on a mild to moderately sedated patient, or even with deep sedation (with the patient maintaining a patent airway and spontaneous ventilation), a significant percentage of those patients will respond, in an uncooperative manner, to a noxious stimulus. If opiate is added to alleviate this unwelcome response, the patient will possibly stop breathing and require ventilatory support, precluding continuation of an upper endoscopy or airway intervention.

      "title": "Ketamine for chronic pain: risks and benefits",
      "abstract": "The anaesthetic ketamine is used to treat various chronic pain syndromes, especially those that have a neuropathic component. Low dose ketamine produces strong analgesia in neuropathic pain states, presumably by inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor although other mechanisms are possibly involved, including enhancement of descending inhibition and anti-inflammatory effects at central sites. Current data on short term infusions indicate that ketamine produces potent analgesia during administration only, while three studies on the effect of prolonged infusion (4-14 days) show long-term analgesic effects up to 3 months following infusion. The side effects of ketamine noted in clinical studies include psychedelic symptoms (hallucinations, memory defects, panic attacks), nausea/vomiting, somnolence, cardiovascular stimulation and, in a minority of patients, hepatoxicity. The recreational use of ketamine is increasing and comes with a variety of additional risks ranging from bladder and renal complications to persistent psychotypical behaviour and memory defects. Blind extrapolation of these risks to clinical patients is difficult because of the variable, high and recurrent exposure to the drug in ketamine abusers and the high frequency of abuse of other illicit substances in this population. In clinical settings, ketamine is well tolerated, especially when benzodiazepines are used to tame the psychotropic side effects. Irrespective, close monitoring of patients receiving ketamine is mandatory, particularly aimed at CNS, haemodynamic, renal and hepatic symptoms as well as abuse. Further research is required to assess whether the benefits outweigh the risks and costs. Until definite proof is obtained ketamine administration should be restricted to patients with therapy-resistant severe neuropathic pain.",

The risk of potential harm to the psychiatric patient seems most obvious in the use of neuroleptic drugs: short-term risks (orthostasis, poikilothermia, hyperprolactinemia, constipation, hesitancy, akathisia, early dystonia, arrhythmia, Parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome) and long-term risks [tardive dyskinesia (TD), retinopathy, cognitive impairment, hepatopathy, light sensitivity/skin dyscoloration, parkinsonism] were soon noticed after the serendipitous discovery of the benefit of chlorpromazine in psychotic disorders (1). With the advent of other antipsychotic drugs, polypharmacy ensued based on clinicians wish to maximize benefits. Despite the fact that combining antipsychotic drugs was officially seen as increasing the risk of side effects, polypharmacy turned out to become more the rule than the exception (2).",

      "title": "Ketamine for Non-Neuropathic Pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain is one of the leading causes of years lost to disability, as most of the time it is refractory to conventional treatment. Recent advances in understanding the pain mechanisms have favored the use of ketamine as a rescue agent in refractory chronic pain conditions, as it has potential modulating effect on both sensory-discriminative and affective motivational components of pain. Preclinical studies also suggested the antinociceptive effect of sub anesthetic dose of ketamine against central and peripheral neuropathic pain conditions and non-neuropathic pain conditions such as inflammatory and nociceptive pain states. Subanesthetic infusion of ketamine along with adjuvants such as midazolam and clonidine is found to reduce the psychomimetic and cardiovascular side effects of ketamine. Even though the consensus guidelines for intravenous use of ketamine for chronic pain advocate the use of ketamine only for complex regional pain syndrome, various other clinical studies suggested its role in other refractory painful conditions. Hence the present topic focuses specifically on the effect of ketamine on non-neuropathic pain conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, ischemic limb pain, etc. Many studies had shown that ketamine not only reduces the pain scores but also the analgesic medications, which further improves the well-being and quality of life.",

Clinical trial data starting from the early 2000s and continuing today indicates that psychedelics are a clinically efficacious treatment for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, all clinical trials examining these substances have excluded any individual with a past or current history of seizures, leaving a large cohort of epilepsy and non-epilepsy chronic seizure disorder patients without anywhere to turn for psychedelic-assisted therapy. These exclusions were made despite any significant evidence that clinically supervised psychedelic use causes or exacerbates seizures in this population. To date, no clinical trial or preclinical seizure model has demonstrated that psychedelics induce seizures. This review highlights several cases of individuals experiencing seizures or seizure remission following psychedelic use, with the overall trend being that psychedelics are safe for use in a controlled, supervised clinical setting. We also suggest future research directions for this field.",

Fatigue frequently presents early in PD, and its prevalence increases with disease progression, affecting up to 60% of patients. Fatigue has a negative impact on quality of life. Fatigue is often associated with other nonmotor symptoms, including sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, and depression. Only a few reports have been published on the treatment of fatigue in PD (methylphenidate, levodopa, and pramipexole). Further well-designed studies, including physiotherapy, are necessary to develop more effective treatments for PD-associated fatigue. A number of patients with PD lose weight because of loss of fat. However, the evolution and determinants of weight loss are not well established. Possible determinants of weight loss in PD include loss of appetite, impaired hand-mouth coordination, difficulty in chewing and dysphagia, nausea, intestinal hypomotility, and increased energy requirements because of muscular rigidity and involuntary movements. Noticeable weight gain has repeatedly been reported after subthalamic or pallidal deep brain stimulation. Because low body weight is associated with negative health effects and a poor prognosis, monitoring weight and nutritional status should be part of PD management.",

It acts as a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, inducing a dissociative state that manifests as catalepsy, unconsciousness and amnesia. Recreational use of ketamine and the number of illicit seizures of ketamine have increased in recent years, prompting a review of current evidence on its toxicity. Recreational ketamine use is associated with a number of toxic effects, both acute and chronic. Predominant among the acute effects are psychotic symptoms, hallucinations and aggression, which can lead to serious injuries. Chronic ketamine use leads to intractable urological problems and neuropsychiatric problems, Long-term effects also include gastrointestinal problems such as abdominal pain and liver function abnormalities. This review summarizes current evidences on the acute and chronic ketamine toxicity associated with its recreational use.",

These include the antipsychotic drugs or neuroleptics, the tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium. Of the three groups, neuroleptics are easily the most widely prescribed agents worldwide. They are being used – and sometimes overused and misused – to treat not only schizophrenia and other psychoses but also a host of additional behavioral disorders. Although neuroleptics continue to be indispensable in the management of a majority of schizophrenic patients, as well as some other psychotic individuals, they have not proved to be an unmixed blessing. In terms of frequency, persistence, and overall impact on the quality of wellbeing for patients and caregivers, movement disorders are the most serious adverse side effects of neuroleptics.",

      "abstract": "Background: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a neuropsychiatric condition which results from thiamine deficiency, most commonly due to alcohol abuse. The prognosis of WKS is poor and its outcome depends mainly on prompt treatment. Case Report: A 52-year-old male with a ten-year history of heavy alcohol abuse was admitted in hospital and treated for WKS. Ataxic and oculomotor symptoms promptly reversed following standard treatment but no change was observed in higher mental functioning. Although the protracted WK symptoms made the patient's improvement unlikely, aggressive treatment with thiamine (600 mg/day orally and 300 mg/day intramuscularly) fully reversed the condition within two months. Conclusion: Even though prolongation of undertreatment of WKS typically precludes significant improvement of symptoms due to irreversible damage of the brain, at least in some cases, higher thiamine doses (over 500 mg/day) for a longer period (at least three months) than usually recommended should be tried. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a relatively common and potentially lethal neuropsychiatric condition which results from thiamine deficiency, usually due to alcohol abuse. Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is the acute phase associated with high mortality and usually presenting with a typical clinical pattern, i.e. oculomotor abnormalities, ataxic symptoms, and mental status changes. Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) is the subsequent chronic form of the disorder, which involves a severe impairment in memory and relatively minor deficits in other cognitive functions. The prognosis of WKS is poor and its outcome depends mainly on prompt treatment (1-3). The present case study describes the second published report (4) of complete recovery from an undertreated WKS following delayed aggressive thiamine treatment.

      "abstract": "Dystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce involuntary twisting and repetitive movements and abnormal postures of the trunk, neck, face, and extremities. Somewhat confusingly, the term \"dystonia\" has been used to designate a specific type of abnormal movement or posture, a syndrome that occurs secondary to a number of underlying neurologic disorders, and a primary disorder known as \"idiopathic torsion dystonia.\" Dystonic movements can be either slow or rapid and are usually more stereotyped and patterned than movements in chorea (random and unpredictable), myoclonus (brief and shocklike), and tremor (rhythmical and not associated with alterations in posture). Dystonia is characterized by failure of normal reciprocal inhibition, which causes co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles accompanied by excessive contraction of other regional muscles. This chapter is limited to conditions characterized by continuous rather than intermittent dystonia and therefore does not include discussion of the paroxysmal dystonias. Psychogenic dystonia is discussed in Chapter 35 together with other functional movement disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Inappropriate use of benzodiazepines is an important public health problem. In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "The potential of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) to lessen persisting benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms was demonstrated in 11 patients who had been drug free for between 1 month and 5 years. Doses ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 mg divided into three intravenous injections over a few hours relieved long-standing symptoms to varying extents. These included clouded thinking, tiredness, muscular symptoms such as neck tension, cramps and shaking and the characteristic perceptual symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, namely, pins and needles, burning skin, pain and subjective sensations of bodily distortion. Mood disorder, when present, also improved but the reduction in anxiety and depression may have reflected relief of physical symptoms. The onset of maximum response was sometimes delayed by as much as a day but was usually prompt. Side effects were reported to be either absent or typically described as lightheadedness or dizziness, lasted only a few minutes and were usually well tolerated. The benefits last between a few hours and several days despite flumazenil's otherwise short duration of action. However, symptoms did return to varying degrees in most cases, suggesting the need for repeated doses.",

      "title": "Efficacy and Safety of Duloxetine in the Treatment of Fibromyalgia: A Systematic Review",
      "abstract": "Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a pain syndrome with manifestations of chronic musculoskeletal pain of non-articular were spread widely without being discovered abnormalities in the musculoskeletal system. In addition to widespread pain, patients with FM often experience other troublesome symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disorders, and cognitive disorders; other specific pain conditions such as chronic headache. Frequently used therapies for treating FM are duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin. Duloxetine is an antidepressant drug that belongs to the SNRI (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) class of drugs. The analgesic effect of duloxetine is believed to be the result of increased serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) activity in the central nervous system (CNS), by increasing the inhibition of pain pathways in the CNS and spinal cord. Methods: We conducted a system-based, computer-based literature search on 8 January 2020. We looked for literature relating to the effectiveness of duloxetine on pain management on FM, using keywords, fibromyalgia, pain, painful, management, therapy, treatment, duloxetine and SNRI. Results: Of the 5 papers that can be used in this review article, the sample population was 732 with FM and was treated with duloxetine. All studies show duloxetine can reduce pain scores and have a side effect that is mostly nausea and headache. Conclusion: Duloxetine can be used to reduce the pain suffered by FM patients and should also be prepared for other treatments to deal with the effects of arising. Keywords: Pain, Fibromyalgia, Duloxetine, effects.",

This conclusion is based on the fact that most clinical trials of these medications in CIPN have failed to demonstrate a significant treatment effect.4,8,11 One hypothesis to explain these results is that painful CIPN may have different pathophysiological mechanisms than other types of neuropathic pain.13,18 However, we identified only 7 published randomized clinical trials that tested the efficacy of treatments for sub-acute or chronic CIPN, and only 4 of those tested treatments with demonstrated efficacy in other neuropathic pain conditions.8 Furthermore, as we describe in this review, the trials that have evaluated the efficacy of neuropathic pain treatments (eg, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants) for CIPN have typically not evaluated pain, but have used variable combinations of \"general\" peripheral neuropathy symptoms, including pain, dysesthesias, and paresthesias (Table 1).",

      "abstract": "Acute seizures frequently occur following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and have been associated with poor patient prognosis. Silent or nonconvulsive seizures (NCS) manifest in the absence of motor convulsion, can only be detected via continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and are often unidentified and untreated. Identification of effective anti-epileptic drugs (AED) against post-traumatic NCS remains crucial to improve neurological outcome. Here, we assessed the anti-seizure profile of ethosuximide (ETX, 12.5–187.5 mg/kg) and phenytoin (PHT, 5–30 mg/kg) in a spontaneously occurring NCS model associated with penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). Rats were divided between two drug cohorts, PHT or ETX, and randomly assigned to one of four doses or vehicle within each cohort. Following PBBI, NCS were detected by continuous EEG monitoring for 72 h post-injury. Drug efficacy was evaluated on NCS parameters of incidence, frequency, episode duration, total duration, and onset latency. Both PHT and ETX attenuated NCS in a dose-dependent manner. In vehicle-treated animals, 69–73% experienced NCS (averaging 9–10 episodes/rat) with average onset of NCS occurring at 30 h post-injury. Compared with control treatment, the two highest PHT and ETX doses significantly reduced NCS incidence to 13–40%, reduced NCS frequency (1.8–6.2 episodes/rat), and delayed seizure onset: <20% of treated animals exhibited NCS within the first 48 h. NCS durations were also dose-dependently mitigated. For the first time, we demonstrate that ETX and PHT are effective against spontaneously occurring NCS following PBBI, and suggest that these AEDs may be effective at treating post-traumatic NCS.",

      "title": "ADVERSE REACTIONS TO PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE",
      "abstract": "The use of naturally occurring and synthetically derived compounds for their \"psychedelic\" effects has been a part of human culture for thousands of years. The basic pharmacology of the major synthetic psychedelic compounds (primarily lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]-25) is described and reference is made to their potentially beneficial psychological effects. Adverse reactions, defined as dysphoric and/or maladaptive/dysfunctional responses to the use of these drugs, sometimes require careful clinical judgment in order to diagnose. These reactions can be effectively classified along a temporal continuum. Acute, short-lived reactions are often fairly benign, whereas chronic, unremitting courses carry a poor prognosis. Delayed, intermittent phenomena (\"flashbacks\") and LSD-precipitated functional disorders that usually respond to treatment appropriate for the non-psychedelic-precipitated illnesses they resemble, round out this temporal means of classification. The question of organic brain damage as well as permanent changes in personality, attitudes, and creativity in patients and normals who have repeatedly ingested psychedelic drugs is controversial, but tends to point to subtle or nonsignificant changes. Future areas for study of the psychedelics' pharmacological, psychological, and therapeutic effects are suggested.",

Each therapy has an influence on the biochemical and pathophysiological alterations caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion can be used with reason in these disorders. The mechanism of action of vinpocetine is interfering on many aspects with the biochemical and pathophysiological processes attributable to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, independently of the original alteration responsible for hypoperfusion.

W pracy przedstawiono i omówiono doniesienia o niewłaściwym używaniu kwetiapiny, nadużywaniu, a nawet uzależnieniu psychicznym, a także o objawach zbliżonych do tak zwanego zespołu dyskontynuacji, często mylonego z zespołem abstynencyjnym występującym w przebiegu uzależnienia.

Z tego względu należy pamiętać o ostrożności w przepisywaniu kwetiapiny tym osobom. W artykule dyskutowane są potencjalne mechanizmy, które mogą prowadzić do niewłaściwego używania kwetiapiny. Jest to prawdopodobnie związane z działaniem sedatywnym i przeciwlękowym co powoduje jej częste stosowanie z substancjami pobudzającymi.

      "abstract": "The present therapeutic approach is aimed at controlling central sensitisation that is supposed to be the core of fibromyalgia's physiopathological mechanisms. The tricyclic antidepressants have some effects on sleep and the improvement of physical activities. Encouraging results have been observed with the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as venlafaxine, milnacipran or duloxetine. New Dopamine D3 receptor agonists as well as the new anticonvulsivants such as gabapentine and pregabalin are equally promising. However the prescription of any medication should take place within a multidisciplinary approach.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

It is concluded that: (i) Differences in the clinical status of the schizophrenic subjects and whether they were receiving medication, but not the method used to measure aftereffects, may underlie the interstudy disagreements. (ii) The effect of schizophrenia is to increase MAE duration, and this is not due to some peripheral artefact.

This review is focused on four pharmacological countermeasures–the “new” drugs modafinil and pemoline, the traditional caffeine, and, as a reference, amphetamine. It is concluded that there is still too little data available to decide whether systematic use of alertness-enhancing drugs is feasible in occupational settings. D-Amphetamine is ruled out because of its abuse potential and mood effects. Modafinil and pemoline have not been tested in field situations, whereas caffeine certainly is used to improve alertness during work, but the use is spontaneous/ad hoc, and there is still a lack of data on its systematic application. Particularly, the optimal amount and pattern of administration need elucidation. (Chronobiology International, 14(2), 145–158, 1997)",

      "abstract": "Neurological disturbances were recorded in 46 out of 58 patients with phenylketonuria. An abnormal electroencephalogram was the most frequent finding. Motor signs were encountered in 31 cases. Only 2 patients showed true hyperkinesias and no other \"extrapyramidal\" signs were observed. Severe neurological dysfunction was most frequent in the most retarded patients. Severe motor signs only occurred in patients in their second and third decade. Twelve of the 58 patients were followed for 6 to 9 years. Five of these evolved supra-nuclear motor signs during the observation period. Two patients further showed definite progression of motor signs already present. The emergence or progression of motor disturbances always occurred in patients in their second or third decade. Thus, motor signs appear to be late phenomena while mental deficiency and epilepsy are early manifestations of phenylketonuria. This may indicate different pathogenetic mechanisms. It is suggested that motor signs are due to demyelination, previously demonstrated. The cause of demyelination may be a toxic effect of excess phenylalanine or its metabolites. Therefore, it should be reconsidered whether or not dietary treatment should be continued beyond the first decade.",

These outbursts may terminate in an epileptic fit. There is an excess in the reaction, with inadequate adaptation to the situation so remote from a well-considered purposeful act that it approaches a pure psychic reflex act in the shape of an almost or entirely unmodified explosion not unlike a convulsion. The explosive diathesis is not characteristic of head injuries, but is also found in hereditary degeneration, in alcoholic degeneration, etc.”",

Various lines of evidence, both from clinical and experimental investigations, suggest that neuronal injury in status epilepticus can arise from the prolonged abnormal electrical activity itself, i.e., even in the absence of overt convulsions. It is essential to realize that the treatment of status epilepticus with neuromuscular blockade is not sufficient. Diazepam is often considered the initial drug of choice for the treatment of status epileptics, at least in settings where potential side effects, such as hypoventilation, can be adequately managed. Lorazepam has become increasingly popular as a useful alternative to diazepam in the initial therapy of status epilepticus. Because of its effectiveness and long duration of action, phenytoin has been suggested as initial therapy for status epilepticus.",

The authors describe a 56-year-old woman who developed somnolence and mutism for 11 days postoperatively, after total intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl, propofol, and vecuronium for a femur fracture fixation. The authors concluded that this neurologic complication may be attributed to an unknown effect of propofol. We think another possible explanation for the symptoms described in the case may have been a presentation of central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS). The signs and symptoms of CAS are similar to those described with atropine overdose and consist of somnolence, confusion, amnesia, agitation, hallucinations, ataxia, delirium, stupor, or coma in addition to tachycardia, dry mouth, dry skin, visual disturbances, and dysarthria (2). CAS occurs when drugs occupy central cholinergic sites leading to insufficient release of acetylcholine (2). CAS has been linked to many drugs including atropine sulfate, hyoscine, promethazine, benzodiazepines, opioids, halothane, and ketamine (3). CAS has also been described after propofol anesthesia (4) and even after nitrous oxide withdrawal (5). In animal studies, it has been shown that fentanyl has strong affinity for muscarinic receptors, whereas morphine and alfentanil do not exhibit any affinity for muscarinic receptors (6). Since the patient in the presented case received propofol, fentanyl, and atropine during anesthesia, we feel that CAS is a distinct possibility. CAS symptoms may last from hours to days (7). The diagnosis of CAS is made by exclusion, after ruling out other causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia and by a positive therapeutic response to physostigmine, a centrally active anticholinesterase agent. The incidence of CAS during the postoperative period has been reported to be up to 9.4% after general anesthesia and 3.3% after regional anesthesia with sedation (2). In a prospective study of 962 patients by Link et al. (8), 18 patients developed the syndrome, all of whom responded promptly to physostigmine administration. Katsanoulas et al. (9), reported two cases in which a delay in diagnosis of CAS resulted in unanticipated intensive care admission and acute lung injury. We suggest that the diagnosis of CAS should be considered in all patients, including the one in the case report by Kati et al. (1), who demonstrate abnormal postanesthetic awakening. Additionally, physostigmine should be readily available (10) and administered perioperatively in situations where the possibility of this diagnosis is considered.

      "title": "Quinine Cardiotoxicity: A Mechanism for Sudden Death in Narcotic Addicts",
      "abstract": "Abstract Narcotic abuse has reached alarming proportions in many areas of the United States, carrying with it a pernicious morbidity and a tragic mortality. The latter is estimated to be approximately 0.7 percent of the addict population per annum. There were over 1000 such deaths annually in 1969 and 1970 in New York City alone. Eighty percent of these fatalities in New York are attributed to “immediate acute reactions” following administration (usually intravenous) of narcotics. In Dade County (Metropolitan Miami), Florida, 86 of 87 narcotic-related fatalities, excluding 13 violent deaths in the reported series, “collapsed and died following the injection of a narcotic”. The mechanisms of sudden death in this circumstance are complex and have not been elucidated completely. Several possible explanations include narcotic overdosage with respiratory depression, narcotic induced postural hypotension, hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction, idiosyncratic reaction to unspecified material(s), adverse response to intravenous injection of colloid or particulate material (“colloidoclastic crisis”), or adverse reactions to adulterants in narcotic packets which are purchased “on the street”.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "title": "Syncope And Related Paroxysmal Spells",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal spells are non-epileptic, paroxysmal events that may mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons typical of seizures. They clinically manifest as a transient loss of consciousness, often occurring suddenly, with or without a prodrome. Paroxysmal spells can be caused by psychological disorders such as substance abuse and psychiatric disease or physiological events such as hypoglycemia, traumatic brain injury, and syncope. Psychological Conditions Data suggest that men with psychiatric disease have an increased incidence of syncope or paroxysmal events of unknown etiology. This data should lead clinicians to consider screening for psychiatric disorders in patients with transient loss of consciousness they cannot identify with a clear etiology.Among patients with a history of substance use disorder, 45% have been found to have unexplained syncope. This suggests that prior and current substance use is also associated with increased incidence of transient loss of consciousness of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the emergency department or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from toxicology screening and possible detoxification referral. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood sugar with associated symptoms. In patients without diabetes mellitus, this is usually manifested at glucose levels below 50 mg/dl. To diagnose hypoglycemia, symptoms and blood sugar must improve with exogenous glucose. Hypoglycemia can affect the central nervous system, leading to lightheadedness, nausea, flashes of light, focal neurological deficits, transient loss of consciousness, and seizure. It is, therefore, paramount that patients with any paroxysmal spell or syncope receive a fingerstick glucose. Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injury is an intracranial impairment, often due to external forces. These forces may include blunt or penetrating trauma to the head, causing acceleration/deceleration injury to the cerebral cortex. Intracerebral bleeding, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injuries may result. Injuries, such as an epidural hematoma, may cause a brief state of loss of consciousness, with rapid return of, usually, altered consciousness. Other injuries, such as large subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury may cause worsening mentation and coma over hours to days. This is a result of increased intracranial pressure, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, and finally, neuronal ischemia. Diagnosis is by clinical history and CT imaging, although MRI may be more specific for secondary trauma. Management is to reduce intracranial pressure and edema. Syncope As most paroxysmal events are syncopal, the remainder of this discussion will focus primarily on syncope. Physiologically, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. As such, syncope varies from other etiologies of loss of consciousness in that it does not include head trauma or a post-ictal state. Syncope instead results in complete and rapid resolution of mental status. It may have myoclonic jerking, but no generalized tonic-clonic movement. Rather than a disease, syncope is a symptom of an underlying pathology ranging from benign to life-threatening. Patients are often divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of these patients vary greatly. In the United States, hospitalization costs for syncope are estimated to be $5300 per admission and more than $2 billion annually. These costs are higher than those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma combined. As extensive workups can be costly, time-consuming, and often unnecessary, a growing cadre of management tools has been devised to evaluate patients with syncope. These tools are tailored to determining the etiology of the syncopal event and treating dangerous, high-risk, syncope patients.",

Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Thus, depending only on its temporal characteristics, foot-shock stress appears to activate opioid or nonopioid analgesia mechanisms. Certain forms of stress may act as natural inputs to an endogenous opiate analgesia system.",

      "title": "Neuroleptic-induced movement disorders: historical perspective",
      "abstract": "Soon after the discovery of neuroleptics, neurological side effects of the extrapyramidal type were reported. The first description of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism dates back to the \"Swiss Symposium on Chloropromazine\" held in 1953. Steck in 1954 vividly described the symptoms in a convincing manner. In 1955, Delay and Denicker, observing the therapeutic efficacy and extrapyramidal activity of two seemingly different compounds as chloropromazine and reserpine, used the term \"neuroleptic\" to characterize this common property. Two years later they proposed a definition of neuroleptics taking into account therapeutic efficacy as well as side effects. Such a definition was not accepted by American authors who preferred term like \"major tranquilizers\" and finally \"antipsychotics\". The meaning of neuroleptic parkinsonism (whether it was a side effect or part of the therapeutic action) had been discussed for a long time. The analogy with the clinical manifestations of Von Economo's encephalitis lethargica was also mentioned. Tardive dyskinesia appeared in the literature in the late 1950's. The first report was made by Schoenecker in 1957 who described bucco-oral movements persisting after the neuroleptics were diminished or discontinued. He concluded that these manifestations were different from the acute extrapyramidal side effects. Two years later Sigwald et al. reported involuntary movements of the tongue, lips and facial muscles which appeared after several years of phenothiazine treatment. In 1960 Uhrbrand and Faurbye described bucco-linguo-masticatory movements sometimes associated with trunk and foot movements. Half of these cases persisted (and a few aggravated) after neuroleptic withdrawal. In others the condition was unmasked by the neuroleptic discontinuation. In 1964 Faurbye et al. proposed the term \"tardive dyskinesia\" for this extrapyramidal side effect. After an initial description by Druckman et al. in 1962, the term of \"tardive dystonia\" was first used in 1973 by Keegan and Rajput. The patients described in the early literature were mainly of an advanced age with organic involvement. The first serious epidemiological studies were undertaken in the late 1960's, showing prevalences varying between 0.5 to 65%! Most of the predisposing factors suspected in early studies (cerebral lesions, lobotomy, ECT) were not confirmed in more recent studies that emphasized the role of an older age and a female gender. The interest in tardive dyskinesia varies from one country to another. Perhaps, dyskinesia was more severe and problematic in the USA because of more liberal indications for neuroleptic use, higher doses and smaller choice of neuroleptic medications. Medicolegal aspects have also increased the apprehension of american physicians. Tardive dyskinesia remains an enigmatic phenomenon and a therapeutic challenge. In the future, the possible discovery of antipsychotic molecules devoid of extrapyramidal side effects may discourage the research on these unresolved issues.",

DISORDERS OF MOTILITY It is well known that all extrapyramidal diseases have this factor in common—they all present characteristic disturbances of motility associated with changes in muscle tonus . These disorders of motility can be definitely differentiated from the pyramidal tract, and three forms can be distinguished, all of which are manifested in the course of voluntary, automatic and reflex movements. These three forms are: (1) hypokinesia; (2) diminished or increased muscletone states, manifesting themselves in either hypotonia or hypertonic rigidity: (3) hyperkinesia. 1.

Nicotine is highly lipid‐soluble and rapidly enters the brain after inhalation. Nicotine receptors are found on dopaminergic cell bodies and stimulation of these receptors leads to dopamine release. Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal can be misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and mania. Withdrawal can also exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.",

The most common side effects are of a neurological nature, namely, extrapyramidal effects. An incidence of almost 40% of such drug-induced reactions was reported in a series of several thousand patients being treated with phenothiazines for emotional disturbances. Some of the factors which may play a role relative to this sensitivity are gradually being outlined. Numerous clinical investigations have demonstrated that the drug-induced extrapyramidal-like syndromes are only different from those clinically seen following naturally occurring diseases, such as paralysis agitans ( parkinsonism ) and postencephalitic varieties of basal ganglia disturbances, in that the drug-induced reactions are generally considerd reversible and respond readily to treatment with antiparkinsonian drugs.

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

According to the underlying physiological mechanism, myoclonic spasms can be classified as cortical, subcortical, spinal or peripheral. Myoclonic spasms appear in a wide range of neurological diseases. So-called symptomatic myoclonus is the type that occurs secondary to an identifiable disorder; it is usually accompanied by other neurological signs and is the most frequent kind. Epileptic myoclonus is that which forms part of an epileptic syndrome with a genetic or idiopathic cause, or that is due to static encephalopathy. Essential myoclonus is the least frequent type and includes palatal myoclonus and dystonia-myoclonus syndrome. The main therapeutic objective consists in treating the underlying cause of the myoclonus if possible and in using symptomatic treatment when this is not the case. Antiepileptic drugs that enhance the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid are still the most effective medication. Among the non-antiepileptic drugs, piracetam and 5-hydroxytryptophan stand out above the rest. Botulinum toxin has proved to be effective in palatal myoclonus. In dystonia-myoclonus syndrome, research has been conducted on the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation on the internal globus pallidus. In the most severe forms of myoclonus, monotherapy is not usually effective.Progress has been made in furthering our knowledge of the neurophysiology of myoclonus, although no very effective forms of treatment have been reported for this motor disorder, which can be extremely disabling.",

The development of hearing loss with the concomitant use of a loop diuretic, ethacrynic acid or furosemide, and an aminoglycoside antibiotic is unique because it is the only situation where a single dose of an aminoglycoside antibiotic may be associated with deafness. The ranking of the ototoxic potential of the aminoglycoside antibiotics in humans is difficult because patient groups from study to study vary in the frequency of risk factors. Animal studies confirm the clinical findings that the ototoxic effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics is enhanced when given together with a loop diuretic, ethacrynic acid or furosemide.",

      "abstract": "Gabapentin was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1993 as an adjunct treatment of epilepsy. In 2004, an additional indication of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia was added. Misuse of gabapentinoids dates back to 2010 while surging recently to the tenth most commonly prescribed medication in 2016. Abuse can be as high as 65% for even those who legally obtained the medication through a prescription. It is used off-label up to 95% of the time despite limited evidence of its efficacy particularly with multiple pain types. The surge in misuse can be attributed not only to off-label use but also an assumption of no abuse potential coupled with clinicians seeking alternative treatment options to the opioids. More common side-effects include sedation, dizziness, and cognitive difficulties. However, even normal dosing can produce side-effects similar to other addictive substances including: euphoria, talkativeness, and increased energy (opioids); sedation (opioids, benzodiazepines); and dissociation (hallucinogens). In fact, a few states including Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia will or have already added gabapentin to the controlled substance rosters even though no federal designation is in place. Identified risks for gabapentin misuse in the literature are limited with the exception of a history of or current substance abuse, particularly opioids. Unfortunately, gabapentin is often co-prescribed with opioids lending to a heightened risk of opioid-related mortality. Clinicians must understand that gabapentin is not effective for a variety of pain conditions nor is a routine substitute for opioids. In addition, close monitoring practices often associated with opioids and benzodiazepines (i.e., regular monitoring for aberrant drug taking behaviors, limits on supply, guarded dose titration) should be applied to that of gabapentin.",

      "abstract": "The selective serotonin-1A receptor partial agonist anxiolytics represent a new class of pharmacologic agents that have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). These compounds offer a completely different pharmacologic approach to this disorder from previous medications. The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) anxiolytics buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone, and SM-3997 have several important new and unique features that will be reviewed in this paper. These features include no cross-tolerance with alcohol or benzodiazepines, no evidence of abuse or misuse potential, and no withdrawal symptoms or rebound anxiety on cessation of therapy. The 5-HT1A anxiolytics have no muscle relaxant, sedative, or anticonvulsant properties and do not impair psychomotor functioning. They do have a slower onset of effect than standard benzodiazepines – clinical response is usually noted in 1–3 weeks. The side effect profile is quite different from that of the benzodiazepines. It includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and restlessness. Some patients with GAD who have received chronic ( > 1 month) benzodiazepine therapy may not respond as well to these compounds initially as will patients with no prior benzodiazepine treatment, especially if the benzodiazepine has been discontinued only recently. These compounds, buspirone in particular, have been shown to have excellent maintenance and prophylactic properties and to be well tolerated with long-term therapy ( > 3 months). Because of their unique mechanism of action and side effect profile, and no evidence of misuse or abuse potential or interference with mental acuity, these compounds represent a definite advance in the pharmacologic management of GAD.",

It is an episode in the course of an intracranial process and is not a disease entity. It is characterized, as a rule, by the sudden onset of severe headache, usually generalized, but most intense in the suboccipital or frontal region; vomiting; collapse, and coma in many instances. Stiffness of the neck then develops, and the patient may have other symptoms and signs due to pressure on adjacent structures. The commonest of these are pain on one side in the temporal or frontal region, double vision and drooping of one eyelid. These findings, of course, are the result of pressure on the fifth and third cranial nerves. There may be mental changes or abnormalities in strength, coordination, reflexes, sensation or functions of other cranial nerves. On the other hand, there may be no focal neurological signs or",

      "title": "The psychedelic renaissance: psilocybin, a breakthrough for treatment resistant depression?",
      "abstract": "Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The lack of response of the condition to conventional medications and augmentation strategies has spawned the search for novel treatment approaches. Psychedelic medications used in conjunction with intensive psychotherapy, so-called psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP), have been evaluated in a limited number of studies as an alternative tactic. This psychedelic renaissance has seen psilocybin, a naturally occurring, potentially hallucinogenic substance occurring in some species of mushrooms, used as one exemplar. The definition of “treatment resistance” varies between different authorities, but there is general agreement that a minimum standard is failure to respond to at least two pharmacological agents from different classes used at a therapeutic dose for an adequate length of time. In the studies to date, more stringent definitions have mostly been applied. Each of the clinical evaluations finds that the addition of a single dose of psilocybin to the psychotherapeutic regimen produces a rapid and clinically significant decline in depressive symptomatology, which is mostly retained in follow-up evaluations out to 12 weeks or longer. Psilocybin was well tolerated with mostly mild to moderate side effects of elevated blood pressure, fatigue, lack of concentration, headache, lethargy, vertigo, feeling of physical or emotional weakness, decreased appetite, nausea, feeling dull, and being easily exhausted, which were transient. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) has occasionally been reported, while there were few reports of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Psilocybin appears to offer the promise of rapid alleviation of resistant depressive symptoms, but further controlled evaluations are necessary before the drug can be given routinely.",

The true incidence of this discontinuation syndrome is unknown because it may be underreported as a consequence of underrecognition or misattribution. This article examines the possible etiology, nosology, mechanisms, and other aspects of the syndrome. Data Sources and Study Selection: A PubMed search was conducted in May 2003 and repeated in January 2004 using the search terms antidepressant and mania. Relevant articles containing adequate descriptions for presentation were retrieved, and their reference lists were hand-searched for further pertinent material. Hand-searches of the indexes of leading psychiatry journals were also performed for the years 1998-2003. Twenty-three articles were identified for review. Conclusions: Antidepressant-withdrawal hypomania or mania may occur rarely with almost any antidepressant drug after sudden withdrawal, tapered discontinuation, or even merely a decrease in dose. The syndrome may be self-limiting, may abate with the reinstitution of the antidepressant drug, or may require specific antimanic treatments; mood stabilizers do not necessarily protect against the syndrome. The true incidence of the syndrome is unknown. Narrow and broad diagnostic criteria are proposed for the syndrome, and a synthesis of literature is provided.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

Spasm of the flexor muscles is associated at times with painful disorders of the lumbar portion of the spine even when objective evidence of involvement of the nervous system is lacking. Spastic paraplegia in flexion resulting from a release of reflex mechanisms in the lumbosacral part of the cord, on the other hand, is of more than passing interest. To any one interested in the physiologic implications of lesions of the spinal cord and the general problem of spastic paralysis few subjects can be more fascinating.

      "abstract": "A drug that subdues exhilaration and produces a calming effect in the subject without necessarily inducing sleep is referred to as sedative. The main system for action of these drugs is the Central Nervous System (CNS). Sedatives are slow working drugs with a levelled dose response curve. They act by modifying nerve responses in CNS to the brain which slows down brain activity thus relaxing the body. Gamma-amino-Butyric acid (GABA) is neurotransmitter which is responsible for retarding the brain functioning and sedatives increase the activity of GABA to produce more effect on the brain activity. Mostly sedatives are used to treat sleep disorders, pain or as anaesthetics. Opioids are sedatives used to treat pain, but long-term usage of these drugs leads to dependency and addiction which may be a challenge to treat. People experience withdrawal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, anxiety, insomnia and/or irritability along with seizures and loss of consciousness in some extreme cases. BXCL501 is a formulation of Dexmedetomidine used to treat agitation and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The drug is designed in such a manner that it reduces agitation but does not produce excessive sedation. The RELEASE clinical trial of “bioxcel therapeutics” lead to the use of this drug to treat or retard opioid withdrawal symptoms and agitations. This article is aimed at reviewing and summarising existing data concerning the synthesis, chemical taxonomy, properties, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile, side effects, interactions, toxicology of dexmedetomidine.",

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure.

A wide range of drugs, including fluoroquinolones, can cause mental status changes in the postoperative period. Thus, a thorough knowledge of various drug actions and interactions as well as various risk factors can help an anesthesiologist counter the possible deleterious effects of delirium during the perioperative period. The side effects of fluoroquinolones on the central nervous system are well documented, although they are rarely suspected as the offending agents for delirium.

      "title": "Mood Stabilizers in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

      "abstract": "TOXICOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CHEMICAL SUBMISSION. According to the French law (article 222-15 modifié par la loi n° 2007-297 du 5 mars 2007), a drug-facilitated crime is defined as voluntary administration to a subject of a noxious substance with a mental or a physical effect. Victims can be highly variable, from very young children to very old people irrespective of their social status. As several practitioners (general physicians, emergency doctors, gynecologists, forensic pathologists, police forces) can be involved during the initial claims, it is often complicated to get a suitable reception after an assault. Indeed, drug-facilitated crimes not only involve sexual assaults, but also robberies with trick, workplace or sport competitions or any situation where the sedation of somebody is required (childcare, old people care homes). The most frequent active substances found in these cases include sedative pharmaceuticals (hypnotics, benzodiazepines, anti-histaminic compounds, neuroleptics) and entactogens (ecstasy, synthetic cathinones). Often, the victim's claims are too late to collect blood or urine, and therefore hair tests constitute the best approach to document drug exposure, which is mandatory during trials at criminal courts.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a clinical paroxysmal disorder of recurring seizures, excluding alcohol or drug withdrawal seizures or such recurring exogenous events as repeated insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Epilepsy has a profound impact on each individual diagnosed with this disease. Seizures have been and are thought to arise as a result of abnormalities in (a) neural circuits, (b) excitation/inhibition balance, (c) potassium, and (d) genetic abnormalities. Therapy for epilepsy is either medical, entailing the use of a variety of antiepileptic drugs, or surgical. An urgent approach to seizure control is indicated when status epilepticus occurs. When all standard therapy fails, general anesthesia can be used to control status epilepticus. Surgery is an option in the treatment of epilepsy and requires extensive preoperative evaluation. The primary concerns for the neuroanesthesiologist anesthetizing the patient with epilepsy are the capacity of anesthetics to modulate or potentiate seizure activity and the interaction of anesthetic drugs with antiepileptic drugs. Proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties have been reported for nearly every anesthetic. If seizure spikes are to be evoked during seizure surgery, then light anesthesia with a proconvulsant anesthetic is used. Conscious analgesia can be used for awake seizure surgery. However, if electrocorticography is not planned, then a general anticonvulsant anesthetic maintenance regimen is used. The latter technique also may be useful in patients whose anesthetic management is complicated by an incidental history of epilepsy.",

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and risk factors for new-onset cervicogenic headache following elective craniotomy",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: New-onset headache within a week after craniotomy is commonly recognized as acute post-craniotomy headache (PCH). This headache pain mainly occurs within the first few post-operative days and is remarkably associated with a younger age, the female sex, and the retrosigmoid approach.[1] The mechanisms of PCH mainly involve mechanical and chemical irritation and aseptic inflammation of the scalp muscles, periosteum of the skull, dura mater, and trigeminal nerves.[2] The frequent onset of PCH leads to impaired daily activities, decreased quality of life, prolonged post-operative recouperation, and worsened social functioning. The differential diagnosis of acute PCH may also lead to the patient receiving many unnecessary tests, including invasive tests such as a lumbar puncture. Cervicogenic headache (CEH) is defined as a headache attributed to disorders of the cervical spine and its component bony, disc, and/or soft tissue elements, with or without accompanying neck pain.[3] An earlier review documented that 3 of 95 patients who had undergone acoustic neuroma surgery developed CEH-like PCH.[4] The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-3 criteria classify such disorders as a CEH caused by inappropriate positioning during the operation and should be precisely differentiated from PCH. The elimination of cervical pain sources remains a crucial component of the treatment of CEH, which is not included in the usual management of PCH. Undifferentiated CEH results in neglected management of cervical pain sources and risks of extensive analgesic consumption. However, exhaustive characteristics of CEH following acoustic neuroma resection and other craniotomies have yet to be disclosed. In this prospective study, we investigated the incidence, clinical manifestations, and risk factors of CEH following craniotomy. This monocentric, prospective, observational study was designed based on an ongoing institutional PAINFREE program (2020–2023), which was proposed to improve post-craniotomy analgesia. The program protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board (Approval No. KY2020-008-02-1) of Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Consecutive patients admitted for elective craniotomy were screened. Those who signed the inform consent and agreed to the study process were enrolled in the PAINFREE program. Participants who entered the program were asked about their overall post-operative pain symptoms by the program assistants until discharge. Subjects with positive compliance were therefore screened and interviewed by pain management specialists through consultations. Through the program, participants' demographic, sociodemographic, admissive, peri-operative, and consultative data and information were collected and recorded by the program assistants and pain management specialists. Between Januaury 2020 and May 2022, consecutive adult patients enrolled in the PAINLESS program were included in the current study. Participants who developed life-threatening peri-operative complications, were admitted to the intensive care unit, or were uncooperative with the consultation inquiries or management plans were excluded. Eligible participants were allocated to two groups based on whether new-onset CEH was diagnosed after craniotomy. Patients with suspected clinical manifestations were evaluated for CEH using the revised Cervicogenic Headache International Study Group and ICHD-3 criteria.[3,5] Manual therapy was denied for peri-operative safety considerations. Diagnosed patients were administered oral analgesics. Diagnostic nerve blockade (DNB) was applied if the headache pain was extremely severe or drug-resistant for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The DNB was accomplished using individually formulated mixtures of 2% lidocaine or 1% ropivacaine and normal saline. Those who obtained a positive DNB were therefore confirmed to have a CEH. Other clinically suspected patients who showed little responsiveness to the DNB were diagnosed with headache following craniotomy attributed to extensive origination. Data acquisition was completed by two of our program assistants. Patients' demographic information (age, sex, and body mass index [BMI]), sociodemographic information (history of smoking and intemperance), pre-existing comorbidities (history of cervicospinal disorder, chronic headache, psychiatric disorder, and systemic diseases), and peri-operative data (craniotomy etiology, surgical approach, incision length, operation duration, operating positioning, and anesthesia technique) were extracted from the PAINLESS case report forms. Information and data obtained during the consultation (primary consultative diagnosis and its approaches, responsiveness to management approaches determined during the consultation, headache pain onset time, laterality, property, intensity [documented as 0 to 10 points on a numerical rating scale, in which 0 represents for no pain and ten denotes the greatest pain imaginable, and pain scores of 0 to 3 points denoted mild pain, 4 to 7 points denoted moderate pain, and 8 to 10 points denoted severe pain], provocation, and accompanying symptoms) using the PAINLESS case report form and the institutional case record system. Subjects were deidentified after the data acquisition and interpretation were completed according to the PAINLESS program protocol. The statistical analysis was performed using R Studio software (RStudio v. 2021.09.0 + 351 \"Ghost Orchid\"; R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and associated packages. Descriptive data are presented as the means ± standard deviations or median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous variables and n (percentages) for categorical variables. Univariate comparisons between two arms were performed using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using Student's t test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with CEH as a binary outcome variable to assess the associations with demographic, clinical, and peri-operative variables. The magnitude of the association with the clinical outcome was reported as the odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]). All tests were two-sided. A P value <0.05 was set to be statistically significant. During the study period, 1629 consecutive patients cumulatively underwent elective craniotomy in the study setting [Supplementary Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/B420]. Two hundred patients were excluded based on the exclusion criteria (20 due to severe peri-operative complications, 157 due to intensive care unit admission, and 23 due to a lack of cooperation with the consultation or DNB), resulting in a total of 1429 patients enrolled in this prospective study. The mean age was 48.98 ± 13.40 years, and 53.4% (763/1429) were women. Headache following craniotomy was reported in 761/1429 (53.3%) subjects, among whom 83 were clinically diagnosed with CEH through consultations. Conservative treatments were initially applied, and positive pain relief was obtained in 61.4% (51/83) patients. DNB was used as needed in the other 38.6% (32/83) individuals, among whom 96.9% (31/32) acquired immediate headache pain relief and were confirmed to have a CEH. One patient presented with a CEH that failed the anesthetic blockade. Further mental examinations indicated that this patient was under significant stress, and the diagnosis of CEH was denied. In summary, 82 patients were finally diagnosed with CEH based on clinical manifestations and interventional techniques. The incidence was 82/1429 (5.8%). The incidence of pre-existing chronic headache (medical history, not a new-onset or acute exacerbation) was 9.8% (8/82) in the CEH population and 12.2% (165/1347) among participants without CEH. The between-group difference was 0.603 according to the chi-squared test. Patients with CEH more frequently had a history of cervicospinal disorders (59/82 [72.0%] vs. 263/1347 [19.5%], P < 0.001), and the difference between groups was statistically significant. No differences were detected in age, sex, BMI, smoking, intemperance, and other pre-existing medical history. Among the peri-operative data and information, patients with CEH had longer operation time (6.45 [IQR: 5.43–7.38] hours vs. 5.10 [IQR: 4.60–5.70] hours, P < 0.001). Other data involving the craniotomy etiology, surgical approach, incision length, operation positioning, and anesthesia technique did not differ between patients with or without CEH following craniotomy [Supplementary Table 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/B420]. Generally, CEH was present 6.0 [IQR: 5.0–8.0] days post-operatively. Headache pain was primarily described as unilateral (71/82, 86.6%), moderate to severe (65/82, 79.3%), dull (54/82, 65.9%), or drilling (21/82, 25.6%) headache pain. Headache was mostly provoked by neck movement or pressing (68/82, 82.9%). Reduced neck motion was reported in 93.9% (77/82) of patients. Nausea with or without vomiting was reported by 31.7% (26/82) of patients. In addition, concurrent neck pain, photophobia, and phonophobia were reported in 29.3% (24/82), 13.4% (11/82), and 6.1% (5/82) of patients, respectively [Supplementary Table 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/B420]. All collected demographic, sociomedical, and peri-operative data and information were entered into the univariate logistic analyses. Continuous variables such as age, BMI, incision lengths, and operation duration were categorically transformed during the process. A history of cervicospinal disorders (OR:10.57 [95% CI: 7.01–16.29], P < 0.001) and an operative duration >5 h (OR:4.95 [95% CI: 2.91–9.07], P < 0.001) were suggestive of CEH following craniotomy. In multivariate analyses, the association remained statistically significant; a history of cervicospinal disorders (OR:10.84 [95% CI: 7.15–16.80], P < 0.001) and an operation duration >5 h (OR:5.18, [95% CI: 3.01–9.60], P < 0.001) were positively associated with the development of CEH following craniotomy [Supplementary Table 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/B420]. In the study, we identified a set of characteristics and several variables associated with CEH following craniotomy. Pre-existing cervicospinal disorders and prolonged operation durations >5 h were associated with an increased risk of developing CEH following craniotomy. Previous studies demonstrated the incidence of CEH was 4.1% (75/1838) of the general population.[6] In our study, 5.74% (82/1429) of the included patients developed CEH after craniotomy, which was similar to and slightly higher than those of a previous investigation, in which the occurrence of CEH similar to PCH was 3.2%.[4] Regarding the onset time, CEH developed on the 6th (IQR:5–8th) post-operative day, which is the late onset and did not match empirical recognition. We speculate that the late onset is due to the early post-operative administration of systemic corticosteroids the following neurosurgery. CEH is characterized by moderate to severe headaches in the occipitofrontal region that may be precipitated by head movement. The pain presents as uni/bilateral, not throbbing or lancinating in nature, with fluctuating severity in non-clustering episodes and variable duration, and is sometimes accompanied by ipsilateral neck, shoulder, or arm pain. Our results were consistent with the aforementioned findings. More than one-quarter of the CEH population failed to determine the characteristics of their headache. The authors proposed that concurrent post-craniotomy pain may interfere with CEH pain and lead to an ambiguous headache pain configuration. Provocative factors were found in 86.6% (71/82) of participants in the study. The most typical trigger was neck movement or pressing, which generated headaches in >80% (68/82) of participants. Other accompanying mechanical or autonomic symptoms reported in the current study were also consistent with previous investigations.[6,7] Our study had limitations. Due to the observational nature, we failed to collect extensive imaging data. For the same reason, comparisons among CEH following craniotomy, acute PCH, post-craniotomy pain, and headache following craniotomy attributed to other causes were beyond our estimation. Additionally, data from the excluded participants were not included in our estimation in this analysis. These results warrant further studies. In summary, CEH is an uncommon post-operative complication of elective craniotomy. Operations longer than 5 hours and pre-existing cervicospinal disorders were significantly associated with the development of CEH following craniotomy. We proposed that the findings would enable pain physicians and neurosurgeons to recognize CEH following craniotomy. As CEH and PCH may overlap within the first week post-operatively, the ICHD-3 criteria might be subjective. Our results should be carefully considered. Funding None. Conflicts of interest None.",

      "abstract": "A bstract : The behavior of neurons in the basal ganglia is severely disrupted in Parkinson's disease (PD). In nonhuman parkinsonian primate models, the disturbance in neurons in basal ganglia output structures include increased firing, bursting, an augmented synchrony, correlated activity, and a tendency towards loss of specificity in their receptive fields. This abnormal neuronal behavior, transmitted to the thalamus, cortex and brainstem, is thought to disrupt the functioning of the motor system and underlie the major motor manifestations of PD—tremor, rigidity, akinesia, gait, and postural disturbances. The mainstay of treatment has been to replace the missing dopamine with medication. With time and disease progression, however, dopamine replacement becomes less efficacious and new adverse effects, including the development of motor fluctuations and drug‐induced involuntary movements or dyskinesias, emerge. When the patients reach this stage, surgical therapy becomes an option. Most surgical interventions are performed at the level of the thalamus, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus, aiming at the disruption of the pathological activity that accompanies the Parkinson's deficiency state. With this abnormal neuronal activity neutralized, normal movements can in many cases be restored.",

      "abstract": "(1) Narcolepsy is a rare disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and typically associated with cataplexy. It is extremely incapacitating, and frequently results in impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced work performance. Currently there is no cure for narcolepsy, so treatment focuses on control of symptoms. (2) Although the sympathomimetic stimulants, such as amphetamines or methylphenidate, are effective in improving excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy, they have the potential for dependence, have sometimes disabling sympathomimetic side-effects and are associated with tolerance. (3) To date, there is clear evidence of the efficacy of modafinil, armodafinil and sodium oxybate in patients with narcolepsy. Modafinil and armodafinil improve excessive daytime sleepiness symptoms and have little abuse potential, but have no effect on cataplexy, so other drugs, such as antidepressants, are required to control cataplexy attacks. (4) Sodium oxybate improves both excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. However, there is potential for abuse and possibly dependence.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a widely diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder giving rise to symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness that can impair daily functioning. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are the mainstay of treatment for ADHD. However, nonstimulant drugs such as viloxazine, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine are becoming more popular due to minimal adverse effects when compared to stimulants.Viloxazine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) originally used to treat depression in adults with activity in both the noradrenergic as well as serotonergic pathways. Studies have demonstrated its efficacy for its use in the treatment of ADHD. Unlike stimulants, viloxazine has a decreased chance of substance abuse, drug dependance, and withdrawal symptoms upon the cessation of therapy. Additionally, dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens after treatment with viloxazine are elevated considerably less in comparison with traditional stimulant ADHD treatments. Viloxazine provides an alternative, nonstimulant approach to treating ADHD.Viloxazine is a recently approved, non-stimulant medication functions by inhibiting the uptake of norepinephrine which has been seen to be decreased in patients with ADHD. When patients do not respond to first-line stimulants, cannot tolerate the side effects, or have contraindications to stimulants, viloxazine may be a nonstimulant option offering patients an increasing arsenal of medications to treat ADHD.",

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "title": "Understanding The Weak Opioids",
      "abstract": "Abstract When pain is moderate and can’t be controlled by the non-opioid (nonnarcotic) drugs, the next step is to use a weak opioid, of which codeine is the most well known. Like the strong opioids, these drugs typically cause constipation, which can be prevented with laxatives (such as senna [Senokot-S], Metamucil, Milk of Magnesia, Dulcolax, or suppositories), stool softeners (such as Colace), or enemas as needed (see Chapter 10). Nausea and vomiting are also sometimes a side effect, although these side effects usually last only a few days with consistent use of these medications. Although physical dependence (which means withdrawal symptoms would occur if the drug were stopped suddenly) and tolerance (which means that, as the body adapts to the dose, more is needed to achieve the same painrelieving effect) sometimes occur, they are usually not important problems when the weak opioids are used for pain. These drugs are not really ‘‘weak’‘; they are just considered weaker than the ‘‘strong’‘opioids (such as morphine) because their dosage is limited by the other compounds with which they are formulated, such as Tylenol or aspirin. Because the dosing guidelines and side effects are so different for the so-called ‘‘strong’‘opioids, a fuller discussion of their use will be explored in the next chapter.",

The toxicology and pharmacology of the drug in abuse are reviewed, and the historical literature of adverse psychiatric outcomes is assessed. Five new cases of dextromethorphan intoxication that resulted in assault, suicide, and homicide are reported, together with the corresponding toxicology results. Blood concentrations ranged from 300 to 19,000 μg/L. These results are compared with typical concentrations reported in therapeutic use and impaired driving cases.

      "abstract": "Regarding the treatment of insomnia, it is said that a considerable degree of advancement has been made to date in terms of controlling toxicity, preventing the development of tolerance and avoiding addiction, which were often observed when administering barbiturates. Nevertheless, the majority of hypnotics used today, which are benzodiazepines, still retain certain side effects such as hangover effects, development of dependence, rebound insomnia as a withdrawal symptom, muscular atonia resulting in falling down and causing bone fracture, inhibition of respiratory system, negative interaction with alcohol, etc. The current trend of selecting hypnotics is to use short-half-life agents. However, there are yet other problems such as cognitive disorders including amnesia, rebound insomnia and increased anxiety during the daytime. In order to cope with these problems, three new hypnotics have recently been developed. They are non-benzodiazepine derivatives and considered to be safer than the others, because they are supposed to cause less side effects than conventional hypnotics. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these new hypnotics can be summarized as follows: 1) these hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega-1 subtype although the agent itself does not belong to the benzodiazepine derivative family; 2) the half-life-time in the serum is extremely short, namely 1-2 hours; 3) they increase the level of slow waves (delta-wave) during sleep; 4) they have a lesser effect toward atonic muscle and amnestic thought and behavioral disturbance as compared to conventional hypnotics; and 5) the risks of developing drug tolerance and reciprocal negative effects with alcohol are smaller. Consequently, we can expect that these new hypnotics will bring a certain advantage, especially regarding the avoidance of hypnotics-induced side effects in the course of clinical treatment of insomnia in the future.",

Perampanel administration was temporarily withheld, and subsequently on restarting, noted to be coincident with neuropsychiatric symptomatology, including motor weakness in emotional contexts. The mechanisms underlying cataplexy are complex and, in our patient, most likely induced by an interaction between Perampanel and the wakeful inhibition of the sublaterodorsal nucleus projections.",

The discovery of an etiology gives a specific dimension to the treatment: either anti-cerebral oedema drugs with above all tetracosactide, a diagnostic test of cerebral tumours, or antidepressor or tranquillizer drugs, depending on the variety of disturbance to be corrected. An attack of migraine always benefits from ergotamine used occasionally and in limited dosage (not more than 6 mg daily or 10 mg per week). For the basic treatment the drugs act mainly peripherally and fairly regularly in the following order: methysergide, beta-blockaders, pizotifene, cyproheptadine, oxetorone.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha adrenergic agonist with high alpha2 receptor affinity that is used for sedation, analgesia, and as an anxiolytic. While the Food and Drug Association approved the use of Dexmedetomidine in the adult intubated population for less than 24 hours or for adult patients undergoing surgery or a procedure, it is being more widely used for longer periods of time in pediatric intensive care units. The common side effects noted with dexmedetomidine are bradycardia, hypotension, and hypertension which are all dose related. While rare, the most common withdrawal symptoms include agitation, irritability, headache, and rebound hypertension which occur occasionally following abrupt cessation of the medication. Posterior reversible encephalopathy (PRES), also known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome or hypertensive encephalopathy is a clinical condition presenting secondary to acute hypertension that results in neurologic symptoms including headaches, seizures, altered sensorium, and loss of vision. It is diagnosed via these clinical findings coupled with characteristic MRI changes that are typically reversible. We report the first case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after a hypertensive crisis likely precipitated by dexmedetomidine withdrawal. An 11 year old female with sickle cell disease was admitted in extremis with hypoxemia, shock and acute chest. She was emergency resuscitated and intubated, and then received both red cell transfusion and exchange transfusion. After 8 days of intubation, and 7 days of dexmedetomidine (dose range 0.8 to 1.5 mcg/kg/hour) infusion and 8 days of fentanyl (dose range from 1 mcg/kg/hour to 2.2 mcg/kg/hour) infusion, she was successfully extubated and her infusions were discontinued without a tapering dose. She was started on intermittent fentanyl and midazolam for potential withdrawal. 12 hours after extubation, she was hypertensive to 160s/90s. She became agitated and combative, and progressed to altered mental status. To treat her hypertension, she was given fentanyl, midazolam, and clonidine and eventually started on a nicardipine infusion. Fentanyl and dexmedetomidine infusions were reinstituted after reintubation, which was 24 hours after initial extubation. Following reintubation, she developed 2 general tonic-clonic seizures, which responded to levetiracetam and midazolam infusions. A head CT was negative, but her head MRI was consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. She had aggressive blood pressure control and seizure management, and slowly improved. After an additional 5 days of intubation and blood pressure control, she was eventually extubated. After extubation for the second time, she was slowly weaned off all infusions and transitional to oral medications over the next 4 days. On day 20 of admission, she was transferred to the general wards and continued her oral blood pressure medications. She was on weaning doses of clonidine and amlodipine at discharge on day 31 of hospital stay. She was functioning at her baseline status with mild developmental delay working with Physical therapy and Occupational therapy at the time of discharge from the hospital. There are other reports of dexmedetomidine withdrawal, but mainly related to agitation and self-limited rebound hypertension. We believe this to be the first case of posterior reversible encephalopathy from dexmedetomidine withdrawal, and want others to be aware of this potential complication.",

Although most reports have usually described a switch from isocarboxazid or phenelzine to tranylcypromine, we report a case of acute central nervous system toxicity possibly associated with a switch from phenelzine to isocarboxazid. SYMPTOMATOLOGY: Predominant symptoms included stuporous sensorium, hypertension, tachycardia, tremor, and urinary retention. Onset of symptoms began within 48 hours after the abrupt MAOI switch. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must allow a sufficient washout period before adding any agent that has a known potential to interact adversely with MAOIs. In addition, patients who are unusually sensitive to one type of MAOI may also be at increased risk for developing problems with a different MAOI secondary to unforeseen pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects, even at doses that are usually considered subtherapeutic.",

More recently a quite different syndrome, tardive dyskinesia has been found to be associated with antipsychotic drug use. Many aspects of the characteristics, etiology, prevention, and treatment of this variegated set of symptom complexes are very unclear at this time. However, patients who clearly show this syndrome are not uncommon and the condition sometimes persists with little improvement for periods of one to two years or indefinitely. The condition does not respond to antiparkinsonian medication.

      "abstract": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms represent common complications in patients with different types of dementia. Predominantly, they comprise psychosis, agitation and mood disorders, disinhibited behavior, impairment of the sleep and wakefulness rhythm, wandering, perseveration, pathological collecting, or shouting. Their appearance is related to more rapid progression of the disease, earlier institutionalization, use of physical restraints, and higher risk of mortality. Consequently, appearance of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia leads to higher costs of care provided and greater distress for caregivers. Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. Pharmacological therapy should be initiated only if the symptoms were not the result of somatic causes, did not respond to nonpharmacological interventions, or were not caused by the prior medication. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines are used. This review summarizes the current findings about the efficacy and safety of the treatment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementias with psychopharmaceuticals. Recommendations for treatment with antipsychotics for this indication are described in detail as this drug group is prescribed most often and, at the same time, is related to the highest risk of adverse effects and increased mortality.

As we know in clinical practice, ketamine is used for anaesthesia, analgesia, sedation, and chronic pain management. Rapid-onset antidepressants resulted from increased levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Extracellular glutamate agents are not new for the treatment of depression. According to the neurobiology view, depression is a monoaminergic phenomenon, so this is the impetus for discovering a new generation of antidepressants. Ketamine can be given intravenously in subanesthetic doses. Still, monitoring must be carrying in therapy administration because of the possible side effects such as hypersalivation, tachycardia, increased systemic arterial pressure, and intracranial pressure.",

The pathophysiology of fatigue is unknown. The role of various mechanisms has been suggested, including the effect of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) on glutaminergic transmission, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, disturbances of astroglia metabolism and decreased levels of the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and serotonin. The diagnosis of fatigue syndrome is based on exclusion of depression and additional organic conditions (anaemia, cardiovascular disorders, kidney diseases or hypothyroidism). The treatment of fatigue syndrome is complex. Physical activity, rehabilitation, psychotherapy and avoidance of factors which may increase fatigue, such as fever, anxiety, depression, pain, sleep disturbances, as well as some drugs like opioids and benzodiazepines, are important. Pharmacological treatment leads to slight improvement. Amantadine, modafinil and pemoline are administered to such patients.",

Dystonic tic, paroxysmal dystonia and hypnotic dystonia show a dystonic posture, although they are also accompanied by various other involuntary movements such as athetosis or chorea. Torticollis, writer's cramp or blepharospasm is assigned to the focal dystonia and Meige syndrome to the segmental dystonia. Symptomatic dystonia is observed in various neurological disorders, including cerebrovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease and Wilson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Pyridoxine deficiency is a prevalent condition in the United States that primarily affects patients with alcohol use disorder. The presentation of this condition is very nonspecific and commonly presents with a constellation of symptoms including peripheral neuropathy, stomatitis, dermatitis, confusion, depression, encephalopathy, and seizures. Over half of these patients have associated alcohol use disorder, which causes pyridoxine deficiency due to the breakdown of pyridoxal phosphate during ethanol metabolism in the liver. As an important cofactor in the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), deficient levels of pyridoxine may lower the seizure threshold due to reduced GABA-mediated inhibition. This case details a 57-year-old male with chronic alcoholism and a history of seizures who developed episodes of myoclonic jerks, tremors, anxiety, and neuropathy whose symptoms persisted even while on anti-epileptic medication. He was found to have pyridoxine deficiency and had full resolution of symptoms shortly after the administration of vitamin B6 supplementation. Pyridoxine deficiency may lead to severe neurologic disorders such as encephalopathy and seizures. Hence, it is important to consider pyridoxine deficiency in the workup of neurologic complaints, especially in high-risk patients.",

Movement disorders in psychiatric patients are usually related to neuroleptic medicines. Extrapyramidal syndromes related to starting these drugs include dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonism, whereas tardive dyskinesia occurs late in the course of the treatment.

The present case report describes an acute dystonic reaction following the abrupt discontinuation of methylphenidate from a drug regimen with risperidone. The patient experienced acute dystonic reactions on three separate occasions when he forgot to take his methylphenidate medication. The present report informs clinicians about the possible side effects, such as dystonia, when psychostimulant and antipsychotic drug combinations are altered and suggests that the abrupt cessation of stimulants may lead to the development of movement disorders. Therefore, appropriate care is necessary when changing the dose of a drug or abruptly discontinuing a drug from a combination of psychostimulants and antipsychotics.",

This is more especially so in the case of those with an aromatic ring, but also in those that lack such a structure.We describe a case of DHS related to the administration of oxcarbazepine (OXC), a ketoanalogue of carbamazepine (CBZ) that has recently appeared on the market in our country, which coursed with interstitial nephritis as the most important clinical manifestation. Our patient developed fever, vomiting, itchy exanthema, kidney failure and biochemical anomalies in the liver after two weeks treatment with this drug. After stopping administration of this anticonvulsant and giving the patient corticoids, the clinical manifestations disappeared and the analytical anomalies began to improve.OXC can give rise to DHS in the same way as other AED with an aromatic ring structure (phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, CBZ and probably also lamotrigine) or without an aromatic ring structure (valproic). Interstitial nephritis may be the most significant and serious clinical manifestation of DHS produced by OXC. According to the review of the literature we carried out, to date no descriptions of this association of nephritis caused by OXC in the context of DHS have been reported.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a potassium channelopathy characterized by constant myokymia and dramatic episodes of spastic contractions of the skeletal muscles of the head, arms, and legs with loss of both motor coordination and balance. During attacks individuals may experience a number of variable symptoms including vertigo, blurred vision, diplopia, nausea, headache, diaphoresis, clumsiness, stiffening of the body, dysarthric speech, and difficulty in breathing, among others. EA1 may be associated with epilepsy. Other possible associations include delayed motor development, cognitive disability, choreoathetosis, and carpal spasm. Usually, onset is in childhood or early adolescence. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, an electrophysiologic test of axonal superexcitability and threshold electrotonus, and/or the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KCNA1 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Acetazolamide, a carbonic-anhydrase inhibitor, may reduce the frequency and severity of attacks in some but not all affected individuals. Antiepileptic drugs may significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in some individuals. Supportive therapies, such as physical therapy, may reduce the risk of later-onset orthopedic complications. Routine treatment of seizure disorders, scoliosis, and developmental disabilities. Prevention of primary manifestations: In addition to pharmacologic treatments, behavioral measures including avoidance of stress, abrupt movements, loud noises, and caffeine may be used to reduce disease manifestations in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Prevention of secondary complications: Joint contractures can be prevented by appropriate physiotherapy. Surveillance: Annual neurologic examination. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Triggers of attacks, including physical exertion, emotional stress, and changes in environmental temperature; marked generalized myokymia has been reported during induction of anesthesia. Pregnancy management: Affected women should be made aware that pregnancy may trigger attacks; possible loss of balance and falls could endanger the fetus. Several stressors that trigger attacks may cause breathing difficulties; thus, delivery by C-section should be considered. Genetic counseling EA1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with EA1 have an affected parent; however, de novo pathogenic variants have been reported. Each child of an individual with EA1 has a 50% chance of inheriting the KCNA1 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member.",

We also succinctly review the possible symptoms of clozapine withdrawal. In addition, we analyze the main features of the very few published cases of clozapine withdrawal-induced catatonia and the relationship between neuroleptic malignant syndrome and the malignant subtype of catatonia. Furthermore, we present the case of a 29-year-old male patient with schizophrenia in whom a malignant catatonic episode/neuroleptic malignant syndrome (with negativism, stupor, mutism, autonomic signs [eg, fever, hyperhidrosis], and elevated creatine kinase levels) began 5 days after the patient decided arbitrarily to cease his clozapine treatment. His catatonic symptoms quickly (ie, within a few days) resolved after the reinstitution of clozapine. Finally, we attempt to provide a theoretical explanation for the surprising finding in the literature that the withdrawal of clozapine, unlike the withdrawal of any other antipsychotics, may be associated with catatonia (frequently its malignant subtype). The take-home message of our case is that clinicians should bear in mind the risk of catatonia (especially the malignant subtype of it) after the prompt withdrawal of clozapine therapy.",

In the present study, we encountered three patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) at advanced stages; all three patients had severe psychosis and severe wearing-off phenomenon and one had severe orthostatic hypotension. Their psychotic symptoms were successfully treated by administration of quetiapine, resulting in the favorable control of motor fluctuations and elevation of therapeutic levels unless any aggravation of parkinsonism occurs. Although the measure against drug-induced psychosis is principally a reduction of the doses or withdrawal of causative drugs, the effective use of antipsychotic drugs, such as quetiapine, is helpful to suppress psychosis and allow the patient to adjust to antiparkinsonian drugs for the control of symptoms other than psychosis.",

Manic and depressive symptoms can be related to hydrocephalus occlusus even in the absence of neurological symptoms.These symptoms disappear after neurosurgery or pharmacological treatment. A 26 year old-male,from Cabo Verde,is interviewed in the Emergency Department in June 2011 presenting disturbance of general behaviour.He is being aggressive and presents flight of ideas.The diagnosis: \"Hypomanic state\" treated with lorazepam 6 mg/day and Olanzapine 5 mg/day. August 2011, the patient is reevaluated because of his behaviour:soliloquies,laughs,expansive mood, abnormal irritability, easily excited to enthusiasm and irritable humor. He also presents psychomotor agitation associated to delusion of persecution.He has not been taking his medication. No other neurological symptoms are detected. In Hospital he receives Risperidone 6 mg/day, Clorazepate Dipotassium45mg/day and Lormetazepam 2 mg /day disappearing most of the symptoms. A MRI was done, presenting triventricular hydrocephalus with absence of intraparenchymal damage.After monitoring the intracranial pressure, Neurosurgery decides not to perform surgery. In the case of not responding to Risperidone, studies have been published that Aripiprazole (atypical antipsychotic with a unique partial agonistic effect at D2receptors)is effective and safe in the treatment of manic episode. Some publications about the reduction of D2receptors demonstrated that the binding of striatal was reduced in NPH.

      "title": "[Clinically relevant drug interactions in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "About 15% of hospital admissions of elderly patients in the Netherlands are caused by adverse effects of drugs. With polypharmacy there is an increased chance of adverse effects occurring. It is not always possible to reduce polypharmacy in the elderly. Polypharmacy is often associated with drug interactions which result in an increased or decreased effect, or the occurrence of adverse effects. Due to changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in the elderly, the effect of interactions is more clinically relevant. Pharmacokinetic interactions influence absorption, liver metabolism or excretion by the kidneys. In particular, interactions with drugs that have a narrow pharmacotherapeutic spectrum can result in serious adverse effects: anticonvulsives, anti-Parkinson drugs, antipsychotics, coumarin derivates, digitalis preparations, lithium salts, opiates, sulphonylurea derivates, tricyclic antidepressants and verapamil. The most important pharmacodynamic changes in the elderly concern an increased sensitivity of the target organ. This is particularly the case for substances which have an effect on the central nervous system, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, but also applies to benzodiazepines, coumarin derivatives and digoxin. When an unexpected adverse effect occurs in a patient or a previously effective therapy suddenly fails, it is wise to consider drug interaction as a possible cause.",

One ought to make this diagnosis with its serious consequences only under the following conditions: --when it is a case of a mostly partial trauma of a nerve with considerable intermingling of sympathetic fibres; --when the pains have a burning and primarily superficial character; --when the pain appear soon (hours, mostly days or weeks, more rarely months afterward) after the trauma; --when the pains are accompanied by considerable vasovegetative symptoms (cold sweats, cyanosis, hyperhidrosis and others). Secondary algodystrophic changes (muscle, joints, bones, and skin) are to be considered. In quantitatively judging the effects, an over-evaluation, as well as an underevaluation, is to be avoided by all means. Therapeutic effects and spontaneous remission after six to twelve months are to be considered. An exemplary case, in which a deterioriation of the capacity to work from 20 to 100% (!) was assumed, showed the need for taking the personality structure of patient into consideration.",

      "title": "Imaging Features of Therapeutic Drug–induced Musculoskeletal Abnormalities",
      "abstract": "Increasing use of a wide variety of therapeutic drugs with known musculoskeletal side-effect profiles necessitates a rigorous understanding and approach when evaluating imaging features suggestive of drug-induced musculoskeletal abnormalities. The etiology of such abnormalities is diverse, and the clinical and imaging manifestations may be nonspecific. The recognition of adverse effects depends, first, on the physician's vigilant review of clinical information for relevant drug history and indicative signs, and second, on the radiologist's ability to detect musculoskeletal changes consistent with known potential effects of specific drugs. Musculoskeletal abnormalities induced by therapeutic drugs may be broadly categorized as embryopathic, juvenile, or postmaturation. Embryopathic skeletal abnormalities result from the teratogenic effects of drugs administered to pregnant women (eg, thalidomide, anticonvulsants). Other therapeutic agents characteristically lead to abnormalities during postnatal skeletal maturation (eg, high-dose vitamins or prostaglandin) either because they are used exclusively in children or because they have idiosyncratic effects on immature musculoskeletal structures. Many drugs (eg, statins) may have musculoskeletal side effects that, although independent of the stage of skeletal maturation, are most often seen in adults or elderly people because they are commonly prescribed for people in these age groups. Drug-induced musculoskeletal abnormalities may be further characterized according to the predominant skeletal manifestations as osteomalacic, proliferative, or osteoporotic and according to the involvement of soft tissues as musculotendinous or chondral.",

There is no accepted definition of CRF, because it is a multifaceted symptom that involves multiple biopsychosocial aspects. Several scales for assessing CRF have been used, unidimensional or multidimensional, but there is no agreement regarding the best instrument to measure CRF. Concerning the CRF treatment, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions have been used. Pharmacologic therapies have been evaluated in few randomized clinical trials: corticosteroids demonstrated a superior efficacy to the placebo in terminal cancer patients; psychostimulants (methylfenidate, dexamphetamine, modafinil), antidepressant (paroxetine), acetilcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil), l-carnitine and coenzyme Q(10) generally have reported negative results. Non-pharmacologic interventions (physical exercise, psychosocial interventions and other integrative interventions, such as yoga, ginseng, acupuncture) have been evaluated in several randomized and non-randomized studies, but with many methodological limitations. Therefore, the most effective non-pharmacological intervention remains unclear and the effect sizes are small.

Some have psychostimulant properties as well. They include psilocybin, mescaline, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ayahuasca, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and NBOMes and tryptamines. Dissociative drugs include ketamine, phencyclidine (PCP), and nitrous oxide. The term empathogens covers MDMA and similar drugs. The prevalence and mode of use of these drugs are described together with their pharmacological effects. Clinical syndromes include acute intoxication and chronic use, flashbacks (characteristic of psychedelic use in particular), psychosis, acute anxiety state, and acute and chronic brain syndromes. The principles of diagnosis and management are then outlined. Dependence is uncommon with hallucinogens, although with regular consumption of microdoses of LSD, it is increasingly recognized. It is well recognized for ketamine and derivatives.",

Other treatments are proposed according to pathophysiological mechanisms, especially central sensitization and abnormal pain modulation. Globally, pharmacological approaches are weakly effective but market authorization differs between Europe and United States. Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for fibromyalgia treatment include serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, such as duloxetine, and pregabalin (an anticonvulsant), which target neurotransmitter modulation and central sensitization. Effect of analgesics, especially tramadol, on pain is weak, mainly on short term. Low-dose naltrexone and ketamine are gaining attention due their action on neuroinflammation and depression modulation, but treatment protocols have not been validated. Moreover, some treatments should be avoided due to the high risk of abuse and severe side effects, especially opioids, steroids, and hormonal replacement.",

Researchers have identified the crucial role of microglial activation in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Furthermore, emerging evidence has shown that the expression and/or activities of different histone deacetylases (HDACs) can modulate microglial function and neuropathic pain. In this review, we will summarize and discuss the functions and mechanisms of HDACs in microglial activation and neuropathic pain development.

Some reasons for looking towards the cannabinoids as potentially useful clinical analgesics are that they present a nonopioid, nonnitrogen-containing, chemical structure and, therefore, a different mechanism, they have no physical-dependence-inducing liability and they have a low toxicity and induce little to no respiratory depression. The chemical stimulus is an injection of an irritant — a specified quantity of phenylquinone, acetic acid and the assessment of the animal's response which is a writhing-stretch of the body.",

      "abstract": "Several cases of sudden, irreversible blindness have been reported in the world literature following injections of various drug combinations in the head and neck. The common feature these drugs have is their capacity to either produce direct neurotoxic effects or embolic phenomena. Two new cases which resulted from injection of the combination of a depo or long‐acting corticosteroid (methylprednisolone acetate, 40 mg) and a local anesthetic and epinephrine or penicillin were added to the growing world literature. The ocular and systemic pathologic findings are described and important questions are raised as to the pathophysiology. The need for an animal model experiment to answer as many of these questions as possible is emphasized.",

      "abstract": "Stimulant drugs are the most commonly used illicit drug group in the world after cannabinoids. While their shared neurobiology is responsible for inducing the sought-after effects of euphoria and energy, subtle differences in their precise action, potency, and route of use mean their main functions and the risks associated with their use are diverse. Acute intoxication, often in combination with other substances, remains the most common risk that users face. High-risk behaviours associated with intoxication and the development of dependence are seen among a minority and require specialist assessment and treatment. Clinically, psychiatrists are most likely to see those who have developed problems with cocaine and methamphetamine, though some of the new psychostimulants that have appeared in recent years may increasingly provide patients for treatment. MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), on the other hand, may, in the lifetime of this edition, move from being seen solely as a recreational drug to one that may have significant therapeutic benefits, for those with post-traumatic stress disorder, for example.",

Treatment options are thus limited to symptomatic presentations and strive to relieve patients and caregivers of some of the behavioral and psychiatric sequelae that can severely impact the quality of life. In fact, neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia affect virtually all patients with dementia at some time during the disease course and are associated with earlier institutionalization, increased caregiving costs (both financial and otherwise), and worsened disease progression. Unfortunately, pharmacological measures acting on neurocircuitry that may be damaged in the brains of patients with dementia as well as attempts to utilize non-pharmacological, cognition-acting strategies in cognitively impaired patients with dementia may not be as effective as they are for younger, non-demented patients. It is also important to note that improvements in behavioral symptoms (e.g., depression) may be due not solely to a prescribed psychotropic agent but may also be a result of the extra social contact with the treatment team that medication warrants.",

Emergency signs in headaches are: violent headache (hemorrhage meninges), convulsions in epilepsy, fever, neck pain (meningitis), neurological disorders (vertigo, paresis, diplopia). Migraine begins with aura (20%), with reversible phenomena within 60 min, with small scotoma that expands, associated with homonymous, lateral hemianopsia (or blindness), scotoma bordered by zigzag bright spots (sensory aura may present progressively transient hemiplegia, auditory hallucinations). All signs regress without sequelae. Treatment in primary headache requires elimination of risk factors: stress, fatigue, food chocolate, coffee, wine, cheese, aspartane, prophylactic treatment as needed with propanolol methysergyl, calcium channel blockers, amitriptyline. Treatment of the acute migraine episode with acetaminophen; in aura, ergotamine tartrate, sumatriptan, topiramate, metoclopramide are indicated. Secondary headache recognizes multiple causes: ocular, cerebral, postneoplazic, posttraumatic, postinfectios, in which the treatment is that of the causal condition.",

nocturnal awakenings, and/ or early morning awakenings.It is recommended that HALCION not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Patients with known hypersensitivity to this drug or other benzodiazepines.HALCION is contraindicated in pregnant women due to&otential fetal damage.Patients likely to become pregnant while receiving HALCI N should be warned of the potential risk to the fetus.WARNINGS: Overdosage may occur at four times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose.Patients should be cautioned not to exceed prescribed dosage.Because of its depressant CNS effects, patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and also about the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs.Anterograde amnesia and paradoxical reactions have been reported with HALCION and some other benzodiazepines.PRECAUTIONS: General: In elderly and/ or debilitated patients, treatment should be initiated at 0.125 mg to decrease the possibility of development of oversedation, dizziness, or impaired coordination.Caution should be exercised in patients with signs or symptoms of depression which could be intensified by hypnotic drugs.Suicidal tendencies and intentional overdosage is more common in these patients.The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function and chronic pulmonary insufficiency.Information for Patients: Alert patients about: (a) consumption of alcohol and drugs, (b) possible fetal abnormalities, (c) operating machinery or driving, (d) not increasing prescribed dosage, (e) possible worsening of sleep after discontinuing HALCION.Laboratory Tests: Not ordmarily required in otherwise healthy patients.Drug Interactions: Additive CNS depressant effects with other psychotropics, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, ethanol, and other CNS depressants.Pharmacokinetic interactions of benzodiazepines with other drugs have been reported.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice during a 24-month study with HALCION in doses up to 4000 times the human dose.Pregnancy: Benzodiazepines may cause fetal damage if administered during pregnancy.The child born of a mother who is on benzodiazepines may be at some risk for withdrawal symptoms and neonatal flaccidity during the postnatal period.Nursing Mothers: Administration to nursing mothers is not recommended.Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy in children below the age of 18 have not been established.ADVERSE REACTIONS: During placebo-controlled clinical studies in which 1003 patients received HALCION Tablets, the most troublesome side effects were extensions of the pharmacologic activity of HALCION, e.g.drowsiness, dizziness, or lightheadedness.HALCION Placebo Number of Patients 1003 997 % of Patients Reporting: Central Nervous System Drowsiness 14.0 6.4 Headache 9. 7 8.4 Dizziness 7.8 3.1 Nervousness 5.2 4.5 Lightheadedness 4.9 0.9 Coordination Disorder/ Ataxia 4.6 0.8 Gastrointestinal NauseaMmiting 4.6 3.7In addition, the following adverse events have been reported less frequently (i.e., 0.9-0.5%):euphoria, tachycardia, tiredness, confusional states/ memory impairment, cramps/ pain, depression, visual disturbances.Rare (i.e., less than 0.5%) adverse reactions included constipation, taste alterations, diarrhea, dry mouth, dermatitis/allergy, dreaming/ nightmares, insomnia, paresthesia, tinnitus, dysesthesia, weakness, congestion, death from hepatic failure in a patient also receiving diuretic drugs.The following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines: dystonia, irritability, anorexia, fatigue, sedation, slurred speech, jaundice, pruritus, dysarthria, changes in libido, menstrual irregularities, incontinence and urinary retention.As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, agitation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects may occur rarely and in a random fashion.Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.No laboratory changes were considered to be of physiological significance.When treatment is protracted, periodic blood counts, urinalysis and blood chemistry analyses are advisable.Minor changes in EEG&anerns, usually low-voltage fast activity have been observed in patients during HALCI N therapy and are of no known significance.DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Controlled Substance: HALCION Tablets are a Controlled Substance in Schedule IV.Abuse and Dependence: Withdrawal symptoms have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines.Patients with a history of seizures are at particular risk.Addiction-prone patients should be closely monitored.Repeat prescriptions should be limited to those under medical supervision.OVERDOSAGE: Because of the potency of triazolam, overdosage may occur at 2 mg, four times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose (0.5 mg).Manifestations of overdosage include somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, slurred speech, and ultimately, coma.Respiration, pulse, and blood pressure should be monitored and supported by general measures when necessary.Immediate gastric lavage should be performed.Multiple agents may have been in~ested.Store at controlled room temperature 15°-30 C (59°•86°F).Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.",

No major changes in the neurological status of these children were observed. However, the three children with ADHD showed an exacerbation of symptoms on fluoxetine. Discontinuation (n = 5) or halving the dosage (n = 7) resulted in complete resolution of these unwanted symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks. In all 7 children whose doses were reduced, improvement of the depressive or obsessive compulsive symptoms was maintained on the lower dosage. Clinicians treating children with fluoxetine are cautioned to be aware of behavioral side effects which may be alleviated by dosage reduction or possibly by starting with lower doses. These side effects may be difficult to differentiate from common psychopathological symptoms such as hyperactivity, restlessness, and impulsivity.",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

There is however an increasing awareness that other drug classes (in particular other psychotropic drugs and calcium channel blockers) are also implicated in the genesis of parkinsonism and other abnormal involuntary movements. Second-generation antipsychotics have a reduced propensity to lead to these side effects but may still cause problems in high-risk groups like people with dementia. Treatments for the various movement problems (parkinsonism, dyskinesia and dystonias) vary dependent upon the symptoms that predominate, given the differential balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic dysfunction between these three side effect clusters. Though stopping or switching the offending drug is always the first option, newer drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease whose effects are upon cholinergic transmission are showing some promise as an adjunct to treatments for motor side effects.",

      "title": "Clinical approaches for poststroke seizure: a review",
      "abstract": "Poststroke seizure is a potential complication of stroke, which is the most frequent acute symptomatic seizure in adults. Patients with stroke may present with an abnormal or aggressive behavior accompanied by altered mental status and symptoms, such as hemiparesis, dysarthria, and sensory deficits. Although stroke manifestations that mimic seizures are rare, diagnosing poststroke seizures can be challenging when accompanied with negative postictal symptoms. Differential diagnoses of poststroke seizures include movement disorders, syncope, and functional (nonepileptic) seizures, which may present with symptoms similar to seizures. Furthermore, it is important to determine whether poststroke seizures occur early or late. Seizures occurring within and after 7 d of stroke onset were classified as early and late seizures, respectively. Early seizures have the same clinical course as acute symptomatic seizures; they rarely recur or require long-term antiseizure medication. Conversely, late seizures are associated with a risk of recurrence similar to that of unprovoked seizures in a patient with a focal lesion, thereby requiring long-term administration of antiseizure medication. After diagnosis, concerns regarding treatment strategies, treatment duration, and administration of primary and secondary prophylaxis often arise. Antiseizure medication decisions for the initiation of short-term primary and long-term secondary seizure prophylaxis should be considered for patients with stroke. Antiseizure drugs such as lamotrigine, carbamazepine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, phenytoin, and valproate may be administered. Poststroke seizures should be diagnosed systematically through history with differential diagnosis; in addition, classifying them as early or late seizures can help to determine treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "The symptom of anxiety, perhaps the most common in all clinical medicine, presents in a variety of forms--psychologic, somatic, behavioral--and often masquerades or is misdiagnosed. Anxiety is a manifestation encountered in a heterogeneous group of syndromes or disorders embracing all of psychiatry. It is necessary to develop the best treatment or combination of treatments appropriate for each case or group of cases. In the treatment of anxiety controlled comparative studies indicate that patients receiving psychotherapy do better than controlled groups. According to present knowledge no one method of psychotherapy is superior to others. The effectiveness of pharmacotherapy alone in the treatment of anxiety is unequivocally established. However, combined therapy of pharmacologic agents and psychotherapy would appear to be superior to either therapy alone. Critical research using existing modalities and combinations of modalities is of vital importance in the treatment of anxiety. Rapid developments in the past twenty-five years in the discovery and differential use of pharmacotherapeutic agents have stimulated renewed interest in the anxiety states and related disorders, as has the emerging body of knowledge regarding possible specific receptor sites in the brain related to anxiety. These developments have heightened interest in research on anxiety with resulting innovations in treatment.",

      "abstract": "Aged people are frequently the victims of iatrogenic diseases, especially adverse effects of drugs since they are affected by many age-related diseases and are given many drugs. Geriatric medicine in Japan has a bitter history of having produced many victims by adverse effects of cerebral vasodilators and cerebral stimulants; they included parkinsonism and depression induced by flunarizine and cinnarizine, and Reye-like encephalopathy induced by calcium hopantenate. Parkinsonism induced by sulpiride, tiapride, metoclopramide or atypical anti-psychotics, dyskinesia induced by anti-parkinsonian drugs or anti-psychotics, and psychotic symptoms induced by anti-parkinsonian drugs, anti-cholinergic drugs, anti-depressants or histamine H2 antagonists are still very common. Wernicke encephalopathy caused by intravenous glucose infusion without thiamine, central pontine myelinolysis by too rapid correction of hyponatremia are important though infrequent. Iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by dura grafts is a warning against the easy use of medical materials produced with human organs or blood. Iatrogenic diseases are preventable, and geriatricians have to pay attention to the information on adverse effects of drugs and medical materials and carefully observe the early signs of iatrogenic diseases.",

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

Its use is highly valuable, but like other immunosupressants, it has adverse effects. One of them is optic neuropathy. Case report. A 47-year-old white male patients who had received tacrolimus therapy for nine years, after kidney transplantation, developed a subacute, painless vision loss on both eyes. He was thoroughly examined on different possible optic neuropathies and other causes of vision loss. After exclusion of other possible causes, the diagnosis of toxic optic neuropathy was established. His therapy was converted to cyclosporine, by his nephrologist, but his vision had improved only slightly. Conclusion. Toxic optic neuropathies are presented in everyday ophthalmological practice, but they are underestimated. Diagnosis can be demanding, especially when it comes to drugs and substances whose possible toxic effect on the optic nerve is not widely known. Unlike other adverse effects of tacrolimus therapy on nervous system, optic neuropathy can causes great and permanent functional impairment.",

Serotoninový systém hraje významnou úlohu při regulaci nálady, agresivity, sexuální aktivity, spánku a citlivosti na bolest. Výzkumy na zvířatech ukazují, že MDMA má neurotoxický účinek; zda to platí také pro člověka, je v současné době intenzivně studováno. MDMA může být nebezpečná a vzácně může způsobit i smrt. Ve vysokých dávkách narušuje MDMA schopnost těla regulovat teplotu. To může vést k rychlému zvýšení tělesné teploty (hypertermie) a způsobit selhání jater, ledvin a kardiovaskulárního systému. Konzumenti MDMA tak čelí stejnému nebezpečí jako konzumenti jiných stimulancií jako je kokain nebo amfetaminy. Tyto zvyšují srdeční frekvenci a krevní tlak, což může být nebezpečné zejména pro osoby s oběhovými problémy a nemocemi srdce, a vyvolávají i další symptomy jako svalové napětí, nechtěné svírání zubů, nucení ke zvracení, rozmazané vidění, mdloby, třesavku a pocení.",

      "title": "KCNQ2-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics KCNQ2-related disorders represent a continuum of overlapping neonatal epileptic phenotypes caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KCNQ2. The clinical features of KCNQ2-related disorders range from KCNQ2-related benign familial neonatal epilepsy (KCNQ2-BFNE) at the mild end to KCNQ2-related neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2-NEE) at the severe end. KCNQ2-BFNE is characterized by a wide spectrum of seizure types (tonic or apneic episodes, focal clonic activity, or autonomic changes) that start in otherwise healthy infants between the second and eighth day of life and spontaneously disappear between the first and the sixth to 12th month of life. Motor activity may be confined to one body part, migrate to other body regions, or generalize. Seizures are generally brief, lasting one to two minutes. Rarely, KCNQ2-BFNE may evolve into status epilepticus. About 10%-15% of individuals with BFNE develop epileptic seizures later in life. KCNQ2-NEE is characterized by multiple daily seizures beginning in the first week of life that are mostly tonic, with associated focal motor and autonomic features. Seizures generally cease between ages nine months and four years. At onset, EEG shows a burst-suppression pattern or multifocal epileptiform activity; early brain MRI can show basal ganglia and thalamic hyperintensities that later resolve. Moderate to severe developmental impairment is present. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis relies on the presence of characteristic clinical findings and heterozygous pathogenic variants in KCNQ2 (also known as Kv7.2), which codes for voltage-gated potassium channel subunits. Management Treatment of manifestations: KCNQ2-BFNE. The majority of children can be kept seizure-free by using phenobarbital (20 mg/kg as loading dose and 5 mg/kg/day as maintenance dose). In some affected individuals, seizures require other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). KCNQ2-NEE. Children have multiple daily seizures resistant at onset to phenobarbital and other common old- and new-generation AEDs, alone or in combination. Sodium channel blockers like phenytoin (PHT) or carbamazepine (CBZ) were shown to control seizures in several patients and should be considered first-line treatment. Surveillance: KCNQ2-BFNE. EEG at age three, 12, and 24 months is appropriate. At 24 months EEG should be normal. KCNQ2-NEE. EEG monitoring is highly recommended, although specific guidelines are not available. Genetic counseling KCNQ2-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with KCNQ2-BFNE have an affected parent; however, a proband may have KCNQ2-BFNE as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Almost all individuals with KCNQ2-NEE have a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with a KCNQ2-related disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",

The patient experiences painful tiredness; in hypotonic tendomyosis the contraction of the muscles becomes painful local on pressure and the patient experiences muscular fatigue or weakness. Contraction becomes painful.3. Reflectory painfulness of the joint capsule and ligaments. The signs stated above are reproducible:1. voluntary externally by voluntary execution of a movement or by assuming a certain posture that is slowed down or inhibited via arthrotendomyotic phenomena, and complete relief from this pain is achieved by elimination of the disturbing factor, for example the crooked posture.2. involuntarily »internally«: In case of disturbing factors such as muscular contractures the arthrotendomyotic reactions disappear as soon as the muscular contractures are reversed.",

      "abstract": "A common and serious drawback of the conventional antipsyehotics is their association with a range of motor disturbances: acute extrapyramidal symptoms, including parkinsonism, acute akathisia and acute dystonia; and chronic motor problems such as tardive dyskinesia, chronic akathisia and tardive dystonia. In addition to physical disability directly related to abnormal movements, the acute movement disorders can cause considerable subjective discomfort and distress, and are frequently cited as a reason for poor compliance with medication, at least during acute treatment. They can also confound clinical assessment of mental-state phenomena because of symptom overlap with the psychotic illness being treated. The results of clinical trials of the newer antipsy-chotic drugs such as dozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride, quetiapine and sertindole suggest a lower liability for acute extrapyramidal symptoms than conventional antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine. The relative liability of each of the newer drugs to cause acute extrapyramidal side effects is not known, as they have been available for a relatively short time and there is a paucity of direct comparative studies. Evidence is accumulating that those patients exhibiting acute extrapyrami-dal side effects are at greater risk of developing tardive dyskinesia, which raises the hope that the newer antipsychotic drugs may also be associated with less tardive dyskinesia in the longer term. Encouraging data are already available for clozapine, which appears to have a low incidence of tardive dyskinesia, and therapeutic value in a proportion of established cases of tardive dyskinesia and tardive dystonia. Here we review the available data on atypical antipsychotics and adverse motor effects.",

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase that plays a fundamental role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Recent emerging evidence demonstrates increased expression and activity of CaMKII in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia of various chronic pain models. Moreover, our previous studies also find that inhibiting CaMKII could attenuate inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. In this review, we provide evidence for the involvement of CaMKII in the initiation and development of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, bone cancer pain, and inflammatory pain.

      "title": "Commentary on Schotte et al. “Development of temporal lobe epilepsy during maintenance electroconvulsive therapy: A case of human kindling?”",
      "abstract": "Kindling is a phenomenon whereby repeated subthreshold stimulations for inducing a particular initial behavior eventually produce that behavior, and with further stimulations additional behaviors are observed.1 It is a model of learning, memory, and epileptogenesis/epilepsy; the latter is because the measured behavior is most often a seizure that becomes progressively more severe. For example, in kindling of the limbic structures in adult rodents, the Racine scale is used.2 These seizures are initially focal and then become bilateral clonic3-5 and eventually tonic (Table 1).2 In experimental studies, kindling can be induced by a variety of electrical or chemical stimuli.3, 4, 6-16 Another form of kindling is the progressive intensification of bilateral (probably generalized) seizures triggered by repeated administration of chemoconvulsants such as flurothyl with associated decrease in the latencies of the onset of the convulsions.17 In almost all the studies, the data suggest that focal seizures eventually become bilateral or the bilateral seizures become more severe. There is only one observation that with repeated audiogenic stimulation in one strain of rats (genetically epilepsy prone rats [GEPR-3]), after a series of bilateral seizures (which are presumed to be of brainstem origin), focal electroencephalography (EEG) discharges appeared in the amygdala with seizure types reminiscent of the Racine stages 1-3.18, 19 The notion that kindling may occur in human epilepsies has been proposed and debated since the first description of the phenomenon by Graham Goddard in 1967.1 There are several excellent reviews on the topic describing the pros and cons of the available studies5, 20 and the evidence is at best scant. This may be due, in part, to the greater number of stimulations needed to elicit kindling, the higher the animal is on the phylogenetic scale.5 Schotte et al21 presented a 67-year-old right-handed woman with no family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures, who had been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions for medically refractory bipolar disease. She received weekly bilateral temporal ECT for 9 years before being switched to right temporal ECT (weekly initially; then reduced to every other week), due to concerns of cognitive deterioration. In parallel, she had been receiving valproate, among other medications, for management of her bipolar disorder. After 17 years and 800 sessions of bilateral or unilateral ECT, and after reducing the sessions from weekly to every other week, she started manifesting epileptic seizures consisting of hyperventilation, tachycardia, impaired awareness, oral and left hand automatisms, and postictal aphasia. Her video-EEG monitoring captured left more than right temporal epileptic discharges and ictal seizure patterns with bilateral onset, although lateralizing electroclinical signs were suggested (reported as starting at or rapidly propagating to the left temporal, although electrographic onset remains unclear). Subtraction ictal SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) coregistered with MRI (SISCOM) showed left hyperperfusion, and interictal fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with anatomy-corrected asymmetry index analysis showed bilateral but greater on the left hemisphere hypometabolism. No obvious association between the timing of ECT sessions and her seizures was observed. The authors propose that this presentation may be a form of ECT kindling of the development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in humans. In this case, this will resemble the studies in the GEPR-3 audiogenic-prone rats and one would have to assume that the ECT seizures are of brainstem origin. Prior reports of epilepsy diagnosed after many episodes of ECT included focal or bilateral onset seizures, while epileptic activity after bitemporal ECT or ipsilateral temporal onset seizures have been reported after unilateral ECT22, 23 and often subside after ECT discontinuation. However, as was the case in the patient described by Schotte et al, ECT discontinuation may not always be possible due to the severity of depression. However, there is an alternative hypothesis that should be considered. The 800 ECT seizures recorded prior to clinical seizure onset could have produced hippocampal injury, and the observed seizures may be a reflection of this injury. The observed cognitive deterioration, reported before the onset of clinical seizures, is supportive evidence. It is also possible that this injury may have been exacerbated by the focal delivery of ECT via a right temporal lobe electrode. This hypothesis could be considered in the interpretation of the data. Of interest, although bilateral temporal pathologies were observed, the interictal pathology (FDG-PET) as well as the lateralizing signs on the ictal SISCOM and electroclinical manifestations showed a preponderance of left temporal pathology, that is, contralateral to the right temporal ECT sessions. If ECT is indeed implicated in the development of TLE in this patient, whether directly by kindling or indirectly as a result of the ensuing temporal lobe pathology, what are the mechanisms responsible for the greater pathology and epileptogenesis at a contralateral focus? Paradoxical lateralizing signs (eg, postictal expressive and receptive aphasia with or without right gaze deviation and right-sided motor signs) have been reported very rarely after right unilateral ECTs of right-handed patients, either immediately after the ECT or postrecovery (“tardive seizures”).24, 25 These have been postulated to reflect “stunning” of eloquent regions after ECT seizure generalization, although it is also likely that underlying predisposing conditions or coadministered drugs may render some patients more vulnerable to manifesting persisting or reactivated seizure foci, contralateral to the ECT. Certainly, the frequency of these paradoxical associations is too low to confirm causality. Furthermore, pre-ECT data on neuroimaging or video-EEG monitoring to determine preexisting pathologies at the contralateral site are missing. The chronic concomitant use of valproate or benzodiazepines for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in some of these patients,21, 25 may have masked or delayed the onset of the clinical manifestations of prior epilepsy. On the contrary, could the unilateral ECT have protected the ipsilateral temporal lobe from injury or propensity to manifest or sustain ictal activity?21, 24, 25 Electroconvulsive seizures result in a period of postictal refractoriness to seizures or epileptic activity26, 27 that may contribute to apparent antiseizure effects. Bilateral ECT has been used to stop superrefractory status epilepticus,28-30 although most studies have been retrospective or case reports, thus warranting further confirmation with prospective studies before recommending its use. Unknowns and possible confounders include the ECT effects on blood-brain barrier permeability and its potential effects on seizure activity or the brain penetration of coadministered drugs (including antiseizure drugs), vascular and cerebral blood flow changes after ECT, direct effects of (unilateral or bilateral) ECT on seizure propensity, comorbidities, and the reciprocal influences of the concomitant brain pathologies due to psychiatric and other comorbidities. Additional factors potentially controlling outcomes are the impact of ECT electrode placement and stimulation protocol on the function of and connectivity patterns within a network that has already been altered by the comorbid conditions and individual factors that may modify the effects of all these interactions. We commend the authors for reviving these interesting and clinically important questions through their “concept and hypothesis” manuscript prompted by their case report. Despite certain, and often unavoidable, practical limitations, inherent to everyday clinical practice, that prevent definitive conclusions, the implications for future systematic research in this area are important. To date the evidence that kindling occurs in humans is still at best questioned. Time will tell.

      "abstract": "Other than for clozapine, there are no pharmacological interventions with robust evidence of a positive benefit–risk balance for the treatment-resistant schizophrenia. For patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, there is usually little to be gained, in comparison to switching the antipsychotic to clozapine, from alternatives such as a further switch to a non-clozapine antipsychotic medication, the prescription of high-dose or combined antipsychotic medications, or the augmentation of continuing antipsychotic medication with other medications, such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or benzodiazepines. However, where these are tried, each initiation of high-dose or combined antipsychotic medication or an augmentation strategy should be treated as an individual trial and appropriately monitored and reviewed, with discontinuation in case of inefficacy or benefit that is outweighed by safety or tolerability concerns.",

Psychiatric disturbances usually take the form of euphoria or elation in mood. Depression is less likely, and irritability or aggressiveness may occur. In about 5 per cent of cases the alteration in mood may be accompanied by clouding of consciousness, delusions, hallucinations and disorientation. This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959). Disturbances may appear within six to seven hours of initial therapy (Goolker and Schein, 1953), after prolonged administration, or even after complete withdrawal of the hormone therapy.",

Literature reviews reporting evidence or indications for sleep bruxism and/or awake bruxism as an adverse effect of several (classes of) medications as well as some addictive substances and literature reviews on medications potentially attenuating sleep bruxism and/or awake bruxism were used as starting point and guidelines to describe the topics mentioned. Additionally, two literature searches were established on PubMed. Three types of bruxism were distinguished: sleep bruxism, awake bruxism and non-specified bruxism.

      "abstract": "Abstract Medical treatment of the addictions remains controversial, with addiction itself viewed as a lifestyle problem, a hijacking of brain systems by drugs, or as a medical illness. Many of these controversies may be avoided by taking a goal-oriented approach to treatment, in which clinical objectives are defined, and both medications and psychological interventions are used to facilitate progress towards these. The effectiveness of medications is maximized when they are used as one component of a comprehensive treatment plan. There are no ‘magic bullets’ in addiction treatment—the same pharmacological principles apply to these drug treatments as to any other. Drugs need to be given in effective doses, at appropriate intervals, allowed time to reach steady state, and also to dissipate when terminated on the basis of their half-life. Some drugs also have an abuse potential of their own (e.g. opiates, sedative-hypnotics) especially those with a rapid onset of action, and such drugs need to be particularly closely monitored and controlled, to minimize their diversion and misuse.",

      "abstract": "A broader palette of safe and better-tolerated agents is available for treating people suffering from chronic schizophrenia, depressive disorders, anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorders. However, current medical treatments are still only partially effective, and highly-prevalent psychiatric disorders continue to represent a huge personal and socio-economic burden. Most pharmacological agents sometimes induce a variety of severe movement disorders, including dystonia or dyskinesia, with an acute, subacute or more chronic time course. More extensive cerebral condition, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome or the serotonin syndrome may be induced by antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Medications commonly involve dopamine receptor blockers, antidepressants and anti-epileptics, among many others. Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia [1]. The traditional and atypical neuroleptics sometimes induce dystonic reactions, akathisia, parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, tremor, hyperkinesia and movement disorders [1]. A better understanding of the impact of these drug-induced adverse effects may provide new strategies to develop novel neuroleptics with less adverse metabolic effects and to develop complementary medical therapies to patients treated with antipsychotic medication [2]. The lack of success in discovering more effective pharmacotherapy has contributed, together with many other factors, to a relative few useful findings on new drug targets for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Geriatric patients with major depression present clinical challenges not encountered in younger individuals, including a greater incidence of medical comorbidity, higher rates of multiple medication use, changes in drug metabolism due to age or physical illness, and increased sensitivity to antidepressant side effects. Nevertheless, successful treatment of depressive disorders in the elderly improves mental and physical functioning, decreases morbidity and perhaps mortality, and enhances quality of life. Recent research indicates that newer antidepressants are effective for late life depression and safer for older individuals. Among newer antidepressants, venlafaxine has a pharmacological profile that makes it an attractive choice for geriatric patients. It has limited potential to interact with other medications because it only weakly inhibits the cytochrome P450 system and binds to plasma proteins at a low level. Dosing may have to be adjusted for patients with renal failure, but typically not for those with liver disease or other medical conditions. Data from three double-blind and four open clinical trials support the safety and efficacy of venlafaxine for geriatric depression. Patients may experience transient, generally tolerable side effects such as insomnia, nausea, agitation, or dry mouth early in treatment, but more serious problems such as falls or cardiac rhythm disturbances seem to be rare. Treatment emergent hypertension occurs in a small percentage of older patients, generally at doses above 150 mg/day. Finally, emerging data suggest that venlafaxine may be effective for conditions such as stroke, anxiety, and neuropathic pain that frequently accompany depressive disorders in the elderly.",

      "title": "Case of risperidone‐induced tardive parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "Parkinsonism is a clinical disorder that can occur after initiation of antipsychotic treatment, and is characterized by tremor, akinesia, bradykinesia, and muscle rigidity. The development of parkinsonism symptoms is dose dependent and occurs in approximately 20–40% of patients. Tardive parkinsonism (TP) is a controversial condition where parkinsonism persists long after cessation of dopamine receptor-blocking agents.1 TP is rarely seen as a clinical manifestation, and only a few cases have been documented in the literature.2-4 Some researchers describe it as a prolonged extrapyramidal syndrome instead of using TP terminology.5 Our patient's first clinical presentation was at age 19 years, with auditory hallucinations and disorganized behaviors. He was followed up and treated with schizophrenia diagnosis that met the DSM-5 criteria. The information obtained from the patient regarding previous treatment history and medication compliance is not clear. When he was 27 years old, depot risperidone (50 mg) was started to increase the medication compliance and treatment efficiency. The patient benefited from that treatment (improvement in visual hallucination and disorganized behaviors), but at the age of 37 years he started to complain about slowness in his motions, which had occurred within the previous 6 months. For this reason, his medication was switched to clozapine and biperiden, which, however, did not significantly improve these symptoms. There were no neurological or parkinsonism findings present in his previous medical history. During his first visit to us, at the age of 37 years, the patient presented with a flat mood, limited sociability, slowness of speech, decreased voice, monotone mimics and jests, poor thought content, flattened affect, and psychomotor retardation. In his motor examination, resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and loss of movement association were reported. He was diagnosed with medication-induced parkinsonism according to a neurological consultation. His United Parkinsonism Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score was 75 and his biochemistry was within the normal range. In terms of brain positron emission tomography, the basal ganglions were evaluated with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and found to be within normal bio-distributions. Due to no family history related to any movement disorder and the late-onset characteristic under the antipsychotic treatment, we speculated that the patient had suffered from TP. Thus, we decided to stop the antipsychotic medications and initiated electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and 3 × 0.125-mg pramipexole treatment. Ten sessions of ECT, and 2 mg/day of pramipexole were applied, which resulted in a significant decrease in the UPDRS score to 23. Amantadine was added to his treatment as an adjunctive therapy but resulted in no significant improvement. Finally, we decided to add five sessions of ECT in combination with a levodopa–benserazide hydrochloride mix (125 mg 3 × 1/2) to his treatment. Although this treatment has been applied to the patient since 2016, parkinsonism findings are still present, which deteriorate the clinical manifestation of the patient. Medication-induced parkinsonism may develop within a few weeks after initiating an antipsychotic or a dose increase of the antipsychotic. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced parkinsonism are classically described as bilateral and symmetric parkinsonism without tremor at rest. Symptoms are dose dependent. Development of medication-induced tolerance or gradual symptoms resolution may be seen in terms of its continuation.6 TP may start after initiating anti-dopaminergic medication and it may take months to years. TP may still be present after medications are given up.1 The most common type of TP is the late tremor type triggering with motion.1 There are no available data regarding dose dependency in TP. In contrast to acute parkinsonism, TP shows less response to the cessation of antipsychotics, anticholinergics, and dopamine agonists, which may be associated with neurostructural changes in TP. In addition to that, dopamine receptor dysfunctions may also be involved with the pathophysiology of TP. We did find three previous case presentations of antipsychotic-induced TP in the literature.2-4 In two out of three cases, female sex, advanced age, and antipsychotic use were described as risk factors for both tardive dystonia and TP. In the present case, the patient only had the risk factor of antipsychotic use as he was both a young adult and of the male sex. Unfortunately, we are limited by the fact that not much is currently understood regarding TP. The most important feature of this case is that the patient showed progressive deterioration without response to treatment. This case was similar to a previously presented case published by Melamed et al. in terms of clinical findings and age,3 where although there was discontinuation of antipsychotics and administration of a dopamine agonist, TP symptoms were still present. Further well-designed clinical studies or case series should be conducted to better understand the pathophysiology of TP. The patient gave informed consent, and his anonymity has been preserved. The authors report no conflicts of interest.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The hallmark physical signs are tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and nigrostriatal pathway of the midbrain. Secondary parkinsonism may be caused by certain drugs (e.g., metoclopramide and haloperidol) or by cerebrovascular disease (e.g., multiple lacunar strokes). The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the history and physical findings. Dopamine replacement is still considered the most efficacious treatment for Parkinson's disease, but dopamine agonists, formerly prescribed only as adjunctive therapy, are emerging as useful initial therapy. Other pharmacologic treatments include drugs that inhibit dopamine-metabolizing enzymes (monoamine oxidase-B and catechol O-methyltransferase). Injections of botulinum toxin can be helpful in patients with associated dystonia or blepharospasm. Surgery may be indicated for certain patients or when symptoms do not respond to medical therapy. Additional adjunctive therapies include physical therapy, nutritional counseling and techniques to help patients manage emotional and cognitive changes related to the disease.",

In an effort to clarify the extent to which the psychostimulant methylphenidate has abuse potential, the existing published evidence has been reviewed and is summarized here, with an emphasis on delineating a number of related but independent issues that are often confused. Methylphenidate produces behavioral effects associated with abuse potential as assessed by traditional assays, but the relevance of this literature to the clinical use of the drug in the treatment of ADHD is ambiguous at best. Existing neuropharmacologic data suggest that methylphenidate has pharmacokinetic properties that reduce its abuse potential as compared with other stimulant drugs of abuse, such as cocaine.",

      "title": "Continuing Clozapine Therapy Despite Morning Pseudoneutropenia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent with demonstrated effectiveness for patients with psychoses that are refractory to treatment with other antipsychotic drugs.1,2 Clozapine is not recommended as first-line therapy for schizophrenia because of its side effects, which include agranulocytosis (0.5% to 2.0% of patients receiving the drug), seizures, weight gain, glucose and lipid disturbances, sedation, sialorrhea, hypotension, and tachycardia.2,3 A trial of clozapine is recommended if there is suboptimal response to adequate trials of antipsychotics from 2 different classes and for patients who cannot tolerate the side effects of other antipsychotic agents.1,2 Clozapine may induce 2 distinct types of neutropenia. The milder form occurs more frequently (in 1.5% to 2% of patients receiving the drug).3,4 The exact mechanism of this form of neutropenia is unknown, but it is thought to be due to the premature destruction of neutrophils in the blood or spleen.3,4 Recovery from this type occurs rapidly, within 3 to 7 days after drug discontinuation, since myeloid maturation in the bone marrow is unaffected. The second type is more severe, manifesting as agranulocytosis, but occurs less frequently (0.8% cumulative incidence at 3 years of treatment). With this form, there is selective depletion of the granulocyte precursors in the bone marrow, and recovery may take from 14 to 22 days.4,5 These patients are at risk of neutropenic sepsis. The risks of morbidity and mortality associated with agranulocytosis necessitate a strict hematologic monitoring program for patients receiving clozapine. Each of the 3 Canadian manufacturers of this drug coordinates a national registry and monitoring program for patients. The risk of agranulocytosis is greatest during the first 6 months of treatment; therefore, weekly assessment of leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count is essential to ensure that the values remain above 3.5 x 109/L and 2.0 x 109/L, respectively. After 6 months of therapy, the frequency of monitoring is reduced to every 2 weeks.2 The 3 clozapine monitoring programs generate alerts that are identified by colour: green, yellow, and red. A patient is deemed to be in the green zone, and blood tests are obtained weekly, if the leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts are above the stated minimum values (3.5 x 109/L and 2.0 x 109/L, respectively). A patient is deemed to be in the yellow zone if the leukocyte count is between 2.0 x 109/L and 3.5 x 109/L or the absolute neutrophil count is between 1.5 x 109/L and 2.0 x 109/L, or if a significant decline in either count (i.e., a single decrease or sum of decreases in leukocyte count of at least 3.0 x 109/L or in absolute neutrophil count of at least 1.5 x 109/L) occurs over a 4-week period; for these patients, leukocyte and absolute neutrophil counts must be determined twice weekly until the counts return to green zone values. If neutropenia occurs (defined as leukocyte count below 2.0 x 109/L or absolute neutrophil count below 1.5 x 109/L), the patient is deemed to be in the red zone, and clozapine is discontinued with no opportunity for reinitiation. “Morning pseudoneutropenia”, or diurnal variation in absolute neutrophil count that necessitates afternoon monitoring of both leukocyte and neutrophil counts, has been reported during clozapine therapy.1,6-10 We describe 2 patients for whom multiple antipsychotic trials had failed and clozapine therapy was initiated. In both patients, hematologic monitoring revealed a pattern of diurnal variation in the absolute neutrophil count. Without close monitoring to detect these trends, the patients might have been classified as being in the yellow zone or perhaps the red zone, which would have led to frequent blood sampling or even discontinuation of therapy. By identifying the diurnal variation, we were able to continue therapy for these treatment-refractory patients.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating disease which can persist despite aggressive treatment. We report the case of an induced ketamine and dexmedetomidine coma for refractory CRPS. BACKGROUND: CRPS is defined as pain with allodynia and autonomic dysregulation. The etiology is likely related to multiple factors including central pain sensitization through NMDA receptor up-regulation. Ketamine at sub-anesthetic doses has demonstrated improvement in pain, however anesthetic dose ketamine may have better long term efficacy. The alpha2-adrenergic effects of dexmedetomidine should synergistically enhance the analgesic effect of ketamine, while reducing the cardiovascular side effects. DESIGN/METHODS: 45 year-old Caucasian male presented with a 2-year history of left hand allodynia, edema, and hyperhidrosis, 6 months after peripheral IV insertion. The pain spread from the left hand to his entire left side, scrotum, rectum and scalp. Prior failed therapy included steroids, neuropathic medications, and sympathetic ganglion blockade. He maintained pain control with 120mg of morphine ER twice daily. Due to the rapid spread of his pain and minimal response to standard treatments, we initiated treatment with a medically induced coma with Ketamine 7mg/kg/hr, Dexmedetomidine 1.5 mcg/kg/hr and Midazolam 17mg/hr. Fentanyl was given for the first day, then weaned. Level of sedation was maintained at a Ramsay score of -4 to -5 with 24 hour EEG monitoring to verify deep coma. RESULTS: After a five day coma, our patient reported 100% resolution of pain without analgesic or opioid usage. He developed severe hallucinations and anxiety as an expected side effect of ketamine, which were treated with a chlordiazepoxide taper. To date, our patient remains pain free (45 days post treatment). CONCLUSIONS: We report the novel combination of anesthetic doses of ketamine and dexmedetomidine to treat refractory CRPS. Continued investigation into this therapy is warranted as a potential treatment regimen for CRPS. Disclosure: Dr. Rasmussen has nothing to disclose. Dr. Malave has nothing to disclose.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of rhabdomyolysis related to correction of hyponatremia secondary to psychogenic polydipsia, possibly complicated by the use of ziprasidone. CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old white man treated for 3 weeks with ziprasidone 40 mg twice daily for chronic paranoid schizophrenia was admitted to the intensive care unit after a witnessed generalized seizure. Marked hypotonic hyponatremia was present secondary to psychogenic polydipsia. After correction of hyponatremia with intravenous NaCl 0.9%, he developed a substantial elevation in the creatine kinase level without any evidence of muscle trauma, stiffness, or swelling or any signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Renal failure or compartment syndrome did not complicate the clinical picture. DISCUSSION: It is well known that severe hyponatremia can cause neurologic complications such as stupor, seizures, and even coma. Hyponatremia from water intoxication (n = 28) and its correction with intravenous fluids (n = 2) may cause non-neurologic complications such as rhabdomyolysis. An explanation may lie within the calcium–sodium exchange mechanism across the skeletal myocyte or the failure of cell volume regulation secondary to extracellular hypo-osmolality. Neuroleptic medications have been linked to the development of rhabdomyolysis, with antipsychotics being the primary offenders. As of August 2005, there has been only one reported case of rhabdomyolysis related to correction of hyponatremia complicated by an atypical antipsychotic (clozapine). It is possible that ziprasidone, like clozapine, may enhance muscle cell permeability leading to rhabdomyolysis under similar conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric patients treated with atypical antipsychotic medications should be closely monitored for rhabdomyolysis during correction of hyponatremia, thus permitting prompt therapy to limit its complications.",

Sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and neuroleptic drugs tend to be the most commonly used psychotropic medications among elderly people who are not developmentally disabled. These drugs are probably commonly employed among elderly mentally retarded people as well; although the rank order of use probably differs. A number of physiological changes which accompany greater age are described and the impact on pharmacokinetic variables outlined. Other factors associated with aging, which influence drug actions, are also outlined. The net effect appears to be that most drugs are more potent, more toxic, or longer lasting among the elderly. Data are also presented on tardive dyskinesia insofar as aging is concerned. This is followed by overall conclusions and some suggested guidelines for the use of these drugs in older mentally retarded persons.",

      "abstract": "Central visual syndromes are disturbances of the higher visual functions characterized by interference with the perceptions of objects whose form color outline and relationship to other objects have already been registered at the primary visual level. 4 types of central visual syndromes resulting from medications or therapies prescribed by physicians have been described. Visual hallucinations constitute the majority of these iatrogenic effects. A wide range of etiologic agents have been identified including penicillin and other anti-infectious agents antiparkinsonians major analgesics psychotropics beta-blockers cardiovascular drugs and nonsteroid anti-inflammatories among others. Bromocriptine used as an antiparkinsonian has been implicated in the etiology of visual hallucinations; the typical doses are about 10 times greater than those used in endocrinology. 3 cases of visual hallucinations have been reported after treatment with clomiphene (Clomid) an ovulation inductor. Visual hallucinations require a search for etiology and termination of use or at least reduction of dose of any implicated medication before serious and irreversible lesions occur. Another type of central visual syndrome chromotopsy is characterized by a sensation of color superimposed on observed objects. The third type transient cortical blindness is a rare condition combining bilateral blindness with a characteristic symptomatology. Its frequency is increasing with the use of new cancer medications. A complete study was published by Walsh and others on the risk of transient cortical blindness in OC users. In 1965 Walsh called attention to the possible role of OCs in the etiology of ophthalmic migraines the 4th type of central visual syndrome. The relationship is accepted by most authors although some controversy remains. Ophthalmic migraines represent only a small proportion of migraine headaches. There is a personal or family history of migraine in 75% of cases suggesting that OCs play a potentiating role. In 25 of 30 cases in 1 study the migraine crises occurred on the days of interrupted OC use or the first days of the new cycle. The strongest migraines occurred during use of OCs with the highest progestin doses. 1 author suggests that 50% of ophthalmic migraines are followed by cerebrovascular accidents. OC use should therefore immediately be terminated if ophthalmic migraines develop.",

The five main forms are chorea, tics, myoclonus, dystonia, and tremor, which can sometimes occur in combination. Some movement disorders are defined by their paroxysmal occurrence (paroxysmal movement disorders) or by their presence only during sleep, and there are other conditions that lie outside the conventional list but are part of the spectrum of movement disorders, for example, stiff person syndrome. It is important to remember that drugs can cause a variety of movement disorders, including some very distinct presentations, and also that all organic movement disorders can be mimicked by so-called psychogenic or functional movement disorders.",

Penetra en el cerebro altamente, produce una elevada propensión al abuso y algunos de sus efectos adversos son: taquicardia, hipertensión, alucinaciones, delirios, agitación, agresividad, autolesiones e ideas suicidas. Existen pocos casos documentados de cuadros psicóticos inducidos por la flakka. 2. Material y métodos Presentamos a un paciente VIH positivo, consumidor de flakka en slamsex que presenta un cuadro psicótico agudo con extrema agresividad e ideación autolitica. 3. Resultados y conclusiones Varón de 30 años que ingresa por un cuadro de irritabilidad, inquietud psicomotriz, desorganización conductual, ideación delirante autorreferencial y de perjuicio, pseudoalucinaciones auditivas e ideación autolítica. La sintomatología aparece en el contexto de consumo de tóxicos de nueva síntesis, flakka fundamentalmente, por vía intravenosa en ‘sesiones’ de encuentros sexuales entre hombres (slamsex). Ha protagonizado varios episodios heteroagresivos graves contra objetos y personas en el contexto del consumo con repercusiones legales. Debido a la similitud estructural de la flakka y los derivados de la anfetamina aunque se desconoce su mecanismo concreto de acción, se puede predecir que altera los sistemas monoaminérgicos centrales y periféricos del sistema nervioso. Por otro lado, el slamsex se asocia a efectos secundarios no deseados en el 40,6% de los participantes con alta repercusión en el funcionamiento psicosocial. En la actualidad nos enfrentamos a un mercado de las drogas muy dinámico y variado, con drogas que provocan una amplia afectación sobre el cerebro y riesgo de producir trastornos mentales, algunos graves y persistentes.

      "title": "Psychedelics and mental health: reimagining care through science, insight, and compassion",
      "abstract": "Introduction In recent years, psychiatry has witnessed a renaissance in the investigation of psychedelic compounds, a broad class of psychoactive substances that induce altered states of consciousness, often characterized by changes in perception, mood, and cognition, which were largely shelved following regulatory crackdowns in the 1970s. The renewed interest is driven by a mounting crisis in mental health treatment efficacy, particularly for conditions labelled as treatment-resistant. As research continues to underscore the limitations of conventional monoaminergic antidepressants, there is a growing openness to alternative paradigms that were previously considered fringe (Wang and Wang 2025). These substances can be categorized into Classic psychedelics (Serotonergic hallucinogens, such as LSD -Lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and mescaline), Entactogens, such as MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), and Dissociative psychedelics such as ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP).Psychedelics are being revisited not merely as pharmacological agents but as facilitators of profound psychological and existential experiences with therapeutic implications. This opinion article explores the current state of evidence, discusses the mechanisms by which psychedelics may exert their effects, and advocates for a balanced, evidence-based integration of these compounds into modern psychiatric care. Therapeutic Potential and Current Evidence Among the most compelling findings is the rapid and enduring antidepressant effect of psychedelics, often after just one or two sessions, especially when combined with psychotherapy, but it is also unclear how much of the effect has to do with the therapy. Increasingly, studies are being conducted with minimal or no therapy (Li and Wang 2025). Psilocybin has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Carhart-Harris et al. (2021) reported that in this 6-week randomized study comparing psilocybin and escitalopram for individuals with persistent mild-to-severe depression, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the primary outcome — the change in QIDS-SR-16 depression scores at week 6. Although secondary outcomes tended to favour psilocybin, the results should be interpreted with caution, as the confidence intervals were not corrected for multiple comparisons, making firm conclusions unreliable. Both groups showed lower depression scores at week 6 compared to baseline, but the lack of a placebo group makes it difficult to determine how much of the improvement was due to the treatment itself. Here, and as in the case of MDMA trials below, we acknowledge the need for an 'active placebo' use with low-dose psychedelics, in order to avoid unsuccessful blinding (Butler at al., 2022, Wen et al., 2024).Similarly, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has shown impressive results in the treatment of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Unlike classic psychedelics such as psilocybin or LSD, which act primarily as 5-HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) receptor agonists, MDMA operates through a different mechanism. It increases synaptic levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and promotes the release of oxytocin, which may underpin its empathogenic and prosocial effects. The Phase 3 trial by Mitchell et al. (2021) demonstrated that MDMA significantly reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment compared to placebo, with a large effect size and favourable safety profile and yet, this was declined by the FDA in the summer of 2024. The juxtaposition between the FDA's \"Breakthrough Therapy\" designation and its subsequent rejection of MDMA-assisted therapy by Lykos Therapeutics in 2024 may seem contradictory. However, \"Breakthrough\" status only reflects preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and the potential for expedited review—it does not guarantee approval. In the case of Lykos, reviewers raised concerns about study methodology, functional unblinding, and safety monitoring. These critiques suggest that psychedelic therapy must meet not only efficacy thresholds but also stringent expectations for rigor, transparency, and real-world feasibility. This tension highlights the evolving regulatory landscape and the need for further multisite trials that balance scientific enthusiasm with methodological conservatism. Mechanisms of Action: Beyond Monoamines Psychedelics primarily exert their effects through agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, leading to a cascade of neurobiological changes. These include increased synaptogenesis, neuroplasticity, and altered connectivity between key brain networks such as the default mode network (DMN), salience network, and executive control network (Vollenweider & Preller, 2020). The transient disintegration of the DMN, often associated with the ego-dissolution experience, appears to facilitate a cognitive reset, allowing patients to revisit entrenched thought patterns with a renewed perspective. This mirrors findings in ketamine research, where rapid antidepressant effects are also linked to neuroplasticity and the reconsolidation of emotional memory (Mikellides et al., 2022). Moreover, psychedelics enable emotional catharsis, insight, and existential re-evaluation, phenomena that are often absent in pharmacotherapy based on chemical symptom suppression. Mikellides et al. (2024) describe the experience as a form of psychological catharsis—a profound emotional release. While some practitioners draw parallels between catharsis and non-ordinary states of consciousness, it is important to distinguish this from a true spiritual emergency. As defined by Grof & Grof, spiritual emergency is more akin to a transient psychotic-like experience marked by identity disruption and disorientation, not merely emotional release (Grof & Grof, 1989; Lukoff et al., 1998). Conflating the two may inadvertently suggest that destabilization is necessary for healing, a notion that carries clinical and ethical risks. Clinical Integration and Challenges Preliminary evidence suggests that the therapeutic context—including set, setting, and therapist support— may influence outcomes with psychedelics. The 'set' refers to the patient's mindset, expectations, intentions, and mental state going into the session; the 'setting' involves the physical and social environment in which the psychedelic is administered. (Gorman et al., 2021, Ko and Lewis 2022). However, the specific contribution of these factors remains unclear in the absence of controlled studies directly comparing drug administration with and without such support. These substances are not stand-alone medications; rather, they function as adjuncts to intensive psychotherapeutic processes. Training therapists and establishing ethical, evidence-based protocols is essential. Additionally, psychedelic treatments remain inaccessible for many due to cost, regulatory hurdles, and stigma and a big portion of the cost is likely to be the labor required to do the therapy (Marseille et al. 2022). These authors demonstrated that MDMA-assisted therapy is not only clinically beneficial but also cost-effective for PTSD treatment. Despite high up-front costs, the intervention yielded substantial long-term savings and health improvements, especially when delivered with a third session.In their 2022 study, Marseille et al. evaluated the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for treating severe or extreme chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States. Utilizing data from a Phase 3 clinical trial, the researchers employed a Markov model to compare MDMA-AT with standard care over a 30-year horizon. The analysis revealed that MDMA-AT, costing $11,537 per patient, could lead to discounted net healthcare savings of $132.9 million per 1,000 patients, accrue 4,856 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and avert 61.4 premature deaths. The therapy was projected to break even on costs within 3.8 years, delivering 887 QALYs by that time. Notably, the inclusion of a third MDMA In review session enhanced both medical savings and health benefits compared to a two-session regimen. Even under conservative assumptions—such as no healthcare cost savings—MDMA-AT maintained an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $2,384 per QALY gained, well below commonly accepted thresholds. These findings suggest that MDMA-AT offers substantial clinical benefits and is cost-saving from a payer's perspective for patients with severe PTSD. However, the authors acknowledge that further research is needed to confirm these results and address potential limitations. Current clinical trials are often conducted in highly controlled academic environments, which may limit generalizability. However, naturalistic studies, such as those involving ketamine (Mikellides et al., 2022), provide encouraging evidence of real-world effectiveness in community settings. Comparison with Ketamine and Other Non-Conventional Treatments Ketamine's entry into psychiatric practice has paved the way for psychedelics. As a dissociative anaesthetic with glutamatergic activity, ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects in patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). It has established a precedent for rethinking what constitutes an effective intervention and challenged the dominance of the monoamine hypothesis (Mikellides et al., 2023). The comparison of ketamine with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in TRD, as explored by Mikellides et al. (2022), highlight that non-traditional therapies can be both effective and safe. Psychedelics are the next logical step in this evolution, offering the potential for deep psychological transformation. who highlight that non-traditional therapies, such as ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, demonstrate both safety and efficacy in treatment-resistant populations. Ketamine induces altered states of consciousness that have shown transformative psychological effects in some patients. Building on this, the field is now exploring classic psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD, which may offer even deeper transpersonal experiences and long-lasting therapeutic benefits.Combination Therapy: Psychedelics and rTMS Emerging anecdotal and clinical evidence (Dębowska et al., 2023) suggests that combining psychedelics with neuromodulatory interventions like rTMS may yield synergistic effects. rTMS, a non-invasive brain stimulation method targeting specific cortical regions, is known to modulate neural circuitry and improve symptoms of depression, OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), and PTSD. In clinical settings in Cyprus rTMS Centres has been used for over 6 years, with growing interest in integrating it with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. The hypothesis is that rTMS may enhance neuroplasticity. This integrative model represents a frontier in personalized psychiatry and warrants formal study. The combined use of ketamine and rTMS (with the Mikellides Protocol) has promising clinical potential, as demonstrated by us (Saabneh et al. 2025, in Press).Psychedelics and Existential Distress in End-of-Life Care Beyond depression and PTSD, psychedelics have shown promise in alleviating existential distress in terminally ill patients. Grob et al. (2011) and Griffiths et al. (2016) found that psilocybin significantly reduced anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer diagnoses. Participants described enhanced meaning, acceptance of mortality, and spiritual well-being following psychedelic-assisted therapy. Comparative Safety and Misconceptions Public and professional scepticism about psychedelics often centres on safety concerns. However, accumulating evidence suggests that, within controlled environments, psychedelics in review are physiologically safe and non-addictive (Zhang et al., 2025, Kumar et al., 2025).Gasser et al. (2022) found that classic psychedelics have an exceptionally low toxicity profile and negligible risk of dependence. Adverse events are rare and usually relate to unsupervised use or underlying psychotic vulnerability. Proper screening, preparation, and integration mitigate these risks. In fact, some experts argue that the relative safety of psychedelics compares favourably with commonly prescribed psychiatric medications..Neuroethical Reflections and the Question of Identity One of the most intellectually provocative aspects of psychedelic therapy is its impact on identity, belief systems, and metaphysical assumptions. Reports of ego dissolution, mystical experiences, and spiritual insight raise questions about neuroethics and informed consent (Letheby 2021). While many patients find these experiences beneficial, some may find them disorienting or even distressing (Yaden and Griffiths 2021). Historical and even recent abuses such as the CIA's MK-ULTRA program, underscore the potential for misuse of psychedelics. Recent public concerns involving high-profile figures highlight ongoing risks of worldview manipulation. The Role of Psychotherapy in Psychedelic-Assisted Treatment The integration of psychotherapy with psychedelic administration has been central to most clinical trials to date. Although many protocols include structured therapeutic support before, during, and after psychedelic sessions, there is a lack of rigorous randomized trials directly comparing drug-alone versus drug-plus-therapy conditions. This limitation makes it difficult to determine whether psychotherapy is essential or simply supportive. A recent commentary underscores this uncertainty. Zamaria et al. (2025) argue that while therapy is widely used alongside psychedelics, its specific therapeutic contribution has not been empirically delineated. Goodwin et al. (2023) similarly question whether the benefits observed in psilocybin trials are due to the drug itself or to the psychotherapeutic framework in which it is delivered. Naturalistic studies of ketamine treatment provide useful insights. For example, Dore et al. (2019) reported significant clinical improvements in patients receiving ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, yet noted that similar outcomes have been observed in patients receiving ketamine infusions without formal therapy. Additionally, Joneborg et al. (2022) highlighted transient neural changes associated with ketamine treatments, suggesting that pharmacological effects alone may drive significant portions of the therapeutic response. Toward a New Therapeutic Paradigm The resurgence of psychedelic psychiatry suggests a turning point in the field. These substances urge us to reconsider the role of consciousness, meaning, and personal narrative in healing. In contrast to the reductionist view of mental illness as mere chemical imbalance, psychedelics promote a reintegrative model where subjective experience, relationship, and insight are central. Such a shift aligns with broader calls in the psychiatric community to rehumanize care. It echoes the principles of compassionate, trauma-informed, and relational psychiatry, where healing arises not solely from neurochemical modulation but through connection, presence, and personal transformation (Mikellides et al., 2023). The Path Forward: Recommendations To responsibly harness the benefits of psychedelics, we recommend the following: 1. Expand Research: Larger, multisite, placebo-controlled trials are needed to refine protocols and determine long-term efficacy and safety. However, it needs to be clarified that in psychedelic research it may be best to use low-dose psychedelics as an active placebo.2. Therapist Training: Establish more widely accessible accredited training pathways for psychedelic-assisted therapists such as MAPS (The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) emphasizing ethics, trauma sensitivity, and integration skills. 3. Policy Reform: Advocate for policies that support compassionate access while upholding rigorous medical standards. 4. Public Education: Combat stigma through evidence-based dialogue that frames psychedelics as tools of healing, not recreation. 5. International Collaboration: Learn from global traditions and practices, especially indigenous cultures that have long employed these compounds for healing. Conclusion Psychedelics are re-entering psychiatry not as recreational relics of the 1960s but as scientifically credible, clinically relevant treatments for some of the most challenging conditions in mental health. Their potential to accelerate healing, enhance insight, and restore meaning makes them uniquely suited to address the deep suffering that characterizes treatment-resistant disorders. As with any powerful intervention, psychedelics demand caution, respect, and a framework of ethical use. But if integrated wisely, they may help usher in a new era of psychiatry—one that prioritizes not only symptom remission but personal transformation, relational depth, and spiritual well-being. The path forward is not merely about approving new molecules. It is about redefining what it means to heal.",

      "abstract": "Reserpine is one of the active alkaloids extracted from the root of the plant Rauwolfia Serpentina. The physiological changes resulting from the use of the drug in animals—such as hypotension, bradycardia, sedation, increased peristalsis, meiosis, etc.—are probably the result of a central action. The precise sites are not known although it seems likely that one of them is the midbrain reticular formation. There is no evidence of any peripheral action, nor of any direct effect on the cortex. The reason for the long latent period, before the drug begins to show an action is still obscure (Lancet Leader, 1955; Mover, 1955; Plummer et al. , 1954). The recent work on the pharmacological relationships between Reserpine, Serotonin and the hallucinogens suggests interesting possibilities (Pletscher et al. , 1955; Shore et al. , 1955). There is already a considerable literature on the toxic effects of Reserpine, the most serious of which are Parkinsonism, of a post-encephalitic type, and severe depression (Achor et al. , 1955; Barsa and Kline, in press; Locket, 1955; Schroeder and Perry, 1955; Stead and Wing, 1955).",

      "abstract": "Hiccups result from a wide variety of conditions that act on the supraspinal hiccup center or that stimulate or disinhibit the limbs of its reflex arc. While scores of hiccup remedies have been reported over the centuries, no single \"cure\" stands out as being the most effective. Measures that stimulate the uvula or pharynx or disrupt diaphragmatic (respiratory) rhythm are simple to use and often help to speed the end of a bout of otherwise benign, self-limited hiccups. Such manuenvers may also terminate persistent hiccups. Drug therapy usually becomes necessary for more intractable hiccups; chlorpromazine and metoclopramide being two of the most widely employed agents for this purpose. Physical disruption of the phrenic nerve, hypnosis, and acupuncture are other modes of therapy that have been used in severe cases. Because so many reports of hiccup \"cures\" are based on anecdotal experience rather than controlled clinical studies, I review the available treatments to provide a rational approach for the management of hiccups.",

Involuntary movements can be classified into several categories according to their phenomenological characteristics and then according to the etiology and/or pathophysiology for each kind of involuntary movement. Involuntary movements include tremor, chorea, ballism, athetosis, dystonia, myoclonus, dyskinesia, tics, asterixis, and motor stereotypy. Many of the involuntary movements can occur as side effects of pharmaceutical drugs. Functional or psychogenic involuntary movements are not infrequently encountered.",

      "abstract": "Lethal catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome are both rare and life-threatening problems. The clinical presentations are very similar, with striking features of altered mental status, fevers, and muscle rigidity. Lethal catatonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder that was first described in the early 1800s, 100 yrs before the use of neuroleptics and other antipsychotic agents. Presently, it appears that this disorder may be an extension and terminal event of excited catatonia. Modern psychopharmacologic practice has almost eliminated this lethal progression. This syndrome is most commonly associated with underlying psychiatric pathology, but may rarely be associated with organic disease. Severe hyperthermia is one of the most striking changes that occurs with lethal catatonia along with a wide spectrum of abnormal behavior, including severe lability of mood, anorexia, bizarre behavior, hallucinations, mutism, catatonia, and muscle rigidity. Hyperthermia may culminate in death secondary to dehydration, end-organ failure, and cardiovascular collapse if it is unrecognized or refractory to therapy. Therapy consists of aggressive supportive therapy, antipsychotic agents, and, on occasion, electroconvulsive therapy (1). The neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an uncommon, but severe, adverse reaction to antipsychotic and neuroleptic medications. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, and an alteration in the level of consciousness. Patients frequently have increased WBC counts and serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is reported to have a mortality rate of approximately 20%. The syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from lethal catatonia, infectious etiologies, central nervous system pathology, malignant hyperthermia, toxic encephalopathy, hyperthyroidism, tetany, parkinsonism, and drug overdose or toxin ingestion (2–5). We present a patient who developed lethal catatonia, which was initially, successfully treated with an antipsychotic drug. However, the patient subsequently developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic challenges of this clinical situation are reviewed.",

The expected relaxing effect was best seen in patients with lesions in the spinal cord, especially multiple sclerosis. Of 18 patients in the spinal group, 14 showed undoubted reduction of spasticity. This was especially convincing in a paraplegic patient whose previously uncontrolled mass flexion spasms were markedly reduced. The effects on patients with diseases affecting the brain, especially paralysis agitans and hemiplegia, were less predictable. In some instances the drug made the symptoms worse. In one case of encephalomyelitis surgery had been contemplated to relieve intolerable spasms of the adductors of the thigh, but the operation became unnecessary when the drug gave relief. Further investigation of the effects of zoxazolamine will be necessary in order to explain its action and define its range of usefulness.",

Although commonly associated with children and adolescents, current literature and practice now demonstrate the impairment the disorder may impose on adults as well. Central nervous system (CNS) stimulant medications are the first-line therapy for ADHD. CNS stimulants include methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives. Longer-acting formulations used once daily are often preferred to avoid medication administration during school or work as well as to avoid side effects associated with rapid fluctuations in serum concentrations associated with multiple daily dosing. Lisdexamfetamine, a new, novel amphetamine product, has been shown to provide efficacy upwards of 12 hours in children and adults with a side effect profile similar to those of other longer-acting amphetamine products. Owing to its unique prodrug composition and the need for oral administration to activate the medication, lisdexamfetamine may offer advantages in clinical situations where stimulant abuse is a concern.",

      "abstract": "Side effects play a significant role in the selection of drugs to be used in panic disorder/agoraphobia whose polyphobic symptomatology often includes a suspiciousness about taking drugs and a fear of undesired side effects which may lead to the refusal of treatment. The safety, side effects and patients' acceptance of alprazolam and imipramine versus placebo were evaluated in 1168 subjects with panic disorder/agoraphobia who had been enrolled in the second phase of the Upjohn World Wide Panic Study. Side effects that worsened over baseline to a greater extent with alprazolam than with imipramine and placebo were sedation, fatigue/weakness, memory problems, ataxia and slurred speech. In the imipramine group blurred vision, tachycardia/palpitations, insomnia, sleep disturbance, excitement/nervousness, malaise, dizziness/faintness, headache, nausea/vomiting and decrease in appetite were worse than in the other groups. In the placebo group the anxious symptoms were most prominent. The highest level of compliance was shown in the alprazolam-treated group and the lowest in the placebo-treated group. Strong predictors of side effects were not observed. If a side effect profile is known, it will be easier for a clinician to choose the right drug and the appropriate management by taking into account compliance, safety and efficacy in each patient under treatment. Further information about side effects in long-term maintenance treatment would be of great clinical pertinence in ensuring safety and enhancing patients' quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract General anesthesia is a state of unconsciousness accompanied by reversible amnesia, analgesia, hypnosis, muscle relaxation, and suppression of autonomic responses, and the patient is unable to respond to voice or painful surgical stimulus. It can be achieved by injection or inhalation of anesthetic agents (induction phase). Once the state of general anesthesia is achieved, it can be maintained by an anesthetic given intravenously or by inhalation (maintenance phase). The most common intravenous hypnotics are propofol, etomidate, thiopental, and ketamine, while sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, and nitrous oxide are typical inhalation anesthetics. Painful stimuli are blocked by opioids (sufentanil, fentanyl, alfentanil, remifentanil), while immobility is achieved by neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA; rocuronium, vecuronium, atracurium, cisatracurium, succynilcholine). The choice of which agents will be used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia depends primary on the state and characteristics of the patient (age, hemodynamic stability, specific diseases, risk of aspiration, potentially difficult airway), but the type of surgical procedure (surgical site, length, level of pain) also plays a role. In addition, the anesthesiologist can choose from several different techniques of general anesthesia: total intravenous anesthesia, total inhalation anesthesia, or balanced anesthesia.",

      "title": "Pain relief is not optional – Choose wisely",
      "abstract": "Pain is a ubiquitous sign which is a result of various etiologies and which needs to be addressed by every means available to a physician. Pain is a manifestation of various physiological, pathological, and other insults which needs urgent relief. Agents used for pain relief can be associated with side effects related to the drug by itself, class effects (like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDS) or drug–drug interactions, respectively. Whatever be the different clinical settings of patient care, pain must be relieved, with due regard for concerns raised from use of pharmacological agents and also techniques feasible in many circumstances during anesthesia. The current issue of the Indian Journal of Anaesthesia (IJA) carries articles dealing with pain management in various settings. In their letter to the editor, opioids during coronary interventions – need reconsideration? Raut and Hanjoora highlight the renewed interest in the effects of opioids when co-administered with anti-platelet medications, impairing their intestinal absorption, in acute coronary syndromes, especially non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.[1] Patients receiving clopidogrel and morphine showed higher rates of ischemic events at Day 4 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.40; P = 0.026) and higher rates of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days. In a summary of the article, analysis being post hoc need for additional studies have been suggested. Have we already lost patients unnecessarily? It is time to pay heed. The long held mnemonic MONA; morphine, oxygen, nitrates, and aspirin has been redefined. This issue has been flagged earlier too, with impaired gastric motility due to opioid co-administration, being the main interaction. With the availability of parenteral anti platelet agents like cangrelor or tirofiban and low molecular weight heparins for rapid onset of action to prevent thrombotic events, the use of beta blockers and nitroglycerin for optimizing ischemia, the need for analgesia has become modified. Alternatives to opioids in myocardial infarction include intravenous paracetamol (1 gm) and aspirin (300 mg) which some patients may already be receiving along with H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors, magnesium as an opioid sparing drug with due caution, gabapentinoids, NSAIDs like naproxen with a better cardiovascular safety profile, lidocaine patches as an off-label use and N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists viz low dose ketamine infusion, and even the time tested route of inhaled nitrous oxide.[2] Sharma et al. have compared the analgesic efficacy of intravenous vs. intrathecally administered dexmedetomidine in below knee surgeries conducted under sub-arachnoid block (SAB) with hyperbaric bupivacaine and conclude that intrathecal route is more efficacious for dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant.[3] Adjuvants for SAB have seen many molecules being studied with opioids, alpha agonists, and others. Dexmedetomidine, though not FDA approved, is safely given by sub-arachnoid route and with other locoregional techniques, whereas concomitant to SAB, intravenous administration is a tradeoff between dose and duration; the dose determining side effects and duration, with a ceiling effect at 0.5 mcg/kg intravenously in prolonging post spinal analgesia being reiterated even in recent clinical studies.[4] The mechanisms explaining the effects are partly local perineural with hyperpolarization of sensory C fibers, to some degree motor A fibers and direct central effects on locus coeruleus.[5] Molecules whose safety is proven or have limited side effects should be the choice of clinicians. Bakshi et al. performed a prospective audit of pain management following emergency laparotomies in cancer patients in a tertiary care cancer hospital and observed that regional techniques are less preferred in such situations for pain management and hence opioids tend to be the mainstay.[6] Analysis of data revealed that most surgeries were performed after normal working hours and patients were predominantly American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), class I and II; two anesthesiologists were present for most cases, 25% patients had hemodynamic instability and there was no correlation between the experience in regional technique and surgical duration respectively. A total of 75% of cases were conducted by anesthesiologists confident/expert in thoracic epidural insertion as per the criteria used for categorising skills of anaesthesiologist involved. Airway concerns were listed along with hemodynamic instability and coagulopathy accounting to only 15% of patients determining choice of anesthesia but the data does not reveal any details of airway related issues nor any haemodynamic manipulations or advanced monitoring in these cases. In total less than 9% patients received the benefit of a contemplated epidural. Pain with movement was moderate to severe in more than 50% patients at 24 h with a median satisfaction level for pain relief of 5 [range 4-7] [on a scale of 1–10 while those who got the benefit of an epidural/regional had an obvious high median score of 8 [range 6.5–8.25]. In 58% of patients, a variety of non-opioid medications were offered in addition to oral morphine, including transdermal patches, tramadol, paracetamol, tapentadol, and diclofenac which probably emphasises the large choice available for anesthesiologists when pain relief is considered in such settings. Prejudice and/or mindset change need to be inculcated where pain, the fifth vital sign, should be managed appropriately irrespective of the time of anesthetic being administered. For laparotomies, the standard of care, unless American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, ASRA guidelines preclude the same, should include epidural analgesia used perioperatively, because Enhanced Recovery After Surgery, ERAS protocols have been successfully implemented in the emergent setting also.[7] Opioid-based anesthesia as evidenced in this audit is a surprise choice. Protocols and changes in management strategies to include regional techniques, albeit ultrasound-guided abdominal wall blocks should also be considered with a sizeable number of residents in training being the frontline in managing patients in the emergent settings. Opioid-free anesthesia combining many opioid sparing strategies is now an emerging process involving loco regional techniques and non-opioid multi modal analgesia. In a recent review article Thota et al. discuss the opioid crisis specifically in relation to oncoanesthesia in the context of immunosuppression following anesthesia and the lack of compelling evidence thereof, the need to reduce chronic opioid use with a change in prescription practices post discharge and a call by the ASA for reducing opioid exposure in the perioperative/surgical setting. They conclude that multimodal opioid sparing strategies should be initiated in each patient undergoing surgery.[8] It should be the endeavor of every physician to provide pain relief in any given clinical setting and all options available should be explored in the context of patient safety and comfort.",

      "title": "The treatment of tardive dyskinesia and tardive dystonia.",
      "abstract": "The enthusiasm produced by the introduction of antipsychotic medication in the 1950s gave way to a certain frustration in the 1970s and 1980s. Despite the development of a large number of new drugs, little progress was made in treatment because these new agents were, in essence, therapeutically equivalent. This lack of progress was perhaps also related to an emphasis on tardive dyskinesia in the 1970s, i.e., the preoccupation with a negative effect of treatment. The reverse is taking place today. Clozapine and the other atypical antipsychotics are associated in people's minds with fewer or absent extrapyramidal symptoms and less tardive dyskinesia than the older typical agents. As a result, a certain amount of complacency exists. Tardive dyskinesia not only may be painful and disfiguring, but it also predicts poor outcome in patients with schizophrenia. Although many treatments have been tried, none have proven completely efficacious. The best treatment for tardive dyskinesia and dystonia is prevention, which is a function of medication choice. Pharmacologic interventions for tardive dyskinesia include clozapine and the other atypical antipsychotics. If typical antipsychotics must be used, they should be started at the lowest possible levels. Studies of risperidone suggest that it, too, should be used at very low doses to minimize the risk of tardive dyskinesia. It is also possible that schizophrenic patients taking atypical antipsychotics may experience fewer spontaneous dyskinesias, although further study is warranted.",

      "abstract": "A 13-year-old boy presented with recurrent episodes of sudden brief posturing of the right upper and lower limbs accompanied by transient inability to speak and a tendency to smile which would sometimes break into laughter. Awareness was retained during the attack, and there was no associated emotional abnormality. The events were precipitated by walking and occurred several times in a day. The laughter was pathological in nature, and the abnormal posturing was akin to 'paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia' (PKD). 'Pathological laughter or crying' is defined as an involuntary, inappropriate, unmotivated laughter, crying or both, without any associated mood change. It can occur as a result of cerebral lesions like tumors, trauma, vascular insults, multiple sclerosis and/or degenerative disorders. It can also be a component of gelastic epilepsy which is characterized by stereotyped recurrences, presence of interictal and ictal epileptiform discharges and absence of external precipitants. In our patient, however, there was no ictal or interictal EEG correlate. Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is characterized by intermittent, involuntary movements triggered by kinesigenic stimuli and is usually familial but can also be secondary to metabolic and structural brain disorders. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in our case, revealed multiple T2 and FLAIR hyperintense, non-enhancing lesions in the periaqueductal gray matter, pontine and midbrain tegmentum, bilateral thalami and left lentiform nucleus suggesting a diagnosis of 'acute disseminated encephalomyelitis', in which this unique combination of pathological laughter and PKD has not been described so far. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) confirmed a demyelinating pathology, and the patient responded well to steroids.",

      "title": "Medication overuse headache - a complex neurologic disorder: genetic susceptibility deserves to be studied.",
      "abstract": "Patients with primary headaches, especially migraine, often need symptomatic medications. Prolonged and frequent use of abortive medication for acute headache can lead to deterioration of the primary headache. This clinical phenomenon is well known as “medication overuse headache”. Medication overuse headache is generally regarded as a consequence of the overuse of acute or symptomatic therapeutic agents in a susceptible patient. The pathogenesis remains unclear. Neurophysiological, functional imaging, genetic and neurochemical studies have provided information regarding the mechanism of headache chronification. Patients without primary headaches usually do not develop medication overuse headache even regularly use analgesics. Furthermore, migraineurs are most susceptible to develop medication overuse headache. Genetic variation has been considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of such susceptibility. Previous studies have attempted to evaluate if genetic polymorphism is involved in the pathogenesis of medication overuse headache. One study found brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism is related to the clinical features of medication overuse headache (1) . Another study found methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (rs1801133) and dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) C939T (rs6275) polymorphisms are factors that independently contribute to the onset of medication overuse headache in patients with migraine (2)",

Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states.

      "abstract": "Principles of benzodiazepine selection are outlined for various psychiatric indications and diverse populations (the elderly, and drug and alcohol abusers). Benzodiazepines are still among the most commonly used classes of medications, and they differ in their pharmacodynamic properties. They have varied uses as monotherapy or as adjunctive medication because of their efficacy in the treatment of conditions involving a dysfunction of the GABAergic system or where neuronal inhibition is required. In multiple therapy, benzodiazepines augment the efficacy of other drugs such as lithium in mania, antipsychotics in psychotic agitation and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder. Benzodiazepines can produce dependence and tolerance in most patients; predisposed individuals are at greater risk. Short- and intermediate-beta half-life compounds carry a greater risk of rebound and withdrawal reactions, and drug dependence than long acting agents. Adverse effects include sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment, memory loss, potentiation of other central nervous system depressants and treatment-emergent depression. Drug potency and beta elimination half-life are reviewed and compared as pharmacokinetic variables.",

      "title": "Review article: current and emerging therapies for functional dyspepsia",
      "abstract": "Summary Functional dyspepsia represents a heterogeneous group of gastrointestinal disorders marked by the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort. Although its precise definition has evolved over the last several decades, this disorder remains shrouded in controversy. The symptoms of functional dyspepsia may overlap with those of other functional bowel disorders including irritable bowel syndrome and non‐erosive reflux disease. There may be coexistent psychological distress or disease complicating its presentation and response to therapy. Given the prevalence and chronicity of functional dyspepsia, it remains a great burden to society. Suspected physiological mechanisms underlying functional dyspepsia include altered motility, altered visceral sensation, inflammation, nervous system dysregulation and psychological distress. Yet the exact pathophysiological mechanisms that cause symptoms in an individual patient remain difficult to delineate. Numerous treatment modalities have been employed including dietary modifications, pharmacological agents directed at various targets within the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, psychological therapies and more recently, complementary and alternative treatments. Unfortunately, to date, all of these therapies have yielded only marginal results. A variety of emerging therapies are being developed for functional dyspepsia. Most of these therapies are intended to normalize pain perception and gastrointestinal motor and reflex function in this group of patients.",

      "abstract": "It is not uncommon for patients who are receiving antipsychotic medication to be given anticholinergic agents, such as biperiden, despite the relative absence of neurological side-effects. Two cases of schizophrenia are reported in which insomnia developed after biperiden withdrawal or reduction. The insomnia continued until biperiden treatment was reinstated, despite the fact that the patients did not exhibit signs or report symptoms indicative of antipsychotic drug-induced neurological side-effects. The occurrence of insomnia following the withdrawal of biperiden or reduction in the dose has not been previously reported. One potential explanation for the insomnia is cholinergic rebound following the withdrawal of biperiden. Int Clin Psychopharmacol 15:357-359 © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins",

When administered intravenously in the context of a therapeutic interview, cocaine caused large, rapid increases in pulse and blood pressure concomitant with profound mobilization of affect and tearfulness. Infusions that caused lesser changes in vital signs were associated with milder degrees of affective change and less dysphoria. Thus, while cocaine was capable of eliciting positive affective change (such as calmness and elation) in depressed patients, affective flooding and dysphoric components were often admixed, indicating that cocaine's effect in this context could not be classified simply as antidepressant.",

All neuroleptics, including newer antipsychotics, have been linked to this condition. Due to similar symptoms, it is debatable if individuals with NMS can be susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH). This case report presents the anesthetic care of a 30-year-old male undergoing general anesthesia in the office-based dental environment. The rationale behind the selected total intravenous anesthesia technique without NMS or MH triggering agents is outlined as well as other agents that may still be questionable regarding their trigger effect for NMS.",

Trauma and shock may be complicated by systemic deposition of fibrin within the vascular tree (disseminated intra-vascular coagulation, DIC). The occurrence of DIC is often observed when the enhancement of coagulation is not balanced by a correspondent enhancement of fibrinolysis. Defective stimulation of fibrinolysis is observed in conditions accompanied by suppression of the fibrinolytic system, such as in pregnancy and after administration of fibrinolytic inhibitors. DIC after trauma and shock is presumably more common in subjects who usually respond poorly to fibrinolytic stimuli (the so-called poor responders) than in 'normal responders'. The same factors which favour the occurrence of DIC seem to have an unfavourable influence also on the final outcome of the complication.",

However, a few case reports have described neuropsychiatric symptoms following PPI use. In this report, we present a case of visual hallucinations secondary to PPI usage and propose possible mechanisms. In this case, a 65-year-old man with no psychiatric history developed acute visual hallucinations following initiation of omeprazole, in the absence of delusions, paranoia, and other psychotic symptoms. The visual hallucinations began after the patient started treatment with omeprazole and resolved almost immediately upon discontinuation of omeprazole. To treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, omeprazole was replaced with famotidine, and the visual hallucinations did not recur after the omeprazole had been discontinued. No other psychotic signs or symptoms were present in this patient throughout the duration of his hospitalization. Although the scientific literature provides limited information on psychosis related to PPI use, a growing number of case reports and studies in recent years have suggested that neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur after PPI use. It is our hope that this case report adds to the scientific and medical knowledge in this area.",

The effects depend on how the body deals with the drug (pharmacokinetics) and how the drug affects the body, including the brain (pharmacodynamics). An extensive range of effects on the brain and psychological functioning can ensue, including effects on intellectual functioning, dexterity, memory, learning and subjective effects. Individual factors are important and can profoundly influence both the type and extent of drug effects. Relevant drugs can be divided into: 1. Those prescribed primarily to treat psychiatric disorders. These include sleeping tablets, tranquillizers, antidepressants and antipsychotics. 2. Those used to treat neurological disorders that have psychological side-effects. Examples are anticonvulsants and anti-parkinsonian drugs. 3. Those used to treat non-nervous disorders that may have psychological side-effects. 4. Illicit drugs used in the non-medical context by drug addicts. Drug-induced states that can influence testimony are mainly sedation, disinhibition, paradoxical reactions and alterations in memory. A list of pointers was given in this paper with respect to practical considerations in assessing the possible effects of drugs on testimony.",

Other reports of withdrawal-like phenomena following acute and chronic intoxication are reviewed and discussed. It is the authors' opinion, based on strong clinical evidence, that glutethimide, like other sedatives, can produce tolerance, habituation, and addiction in some subjects when taken in amounts greater than 2.5 gm. daily. Most careful supervision of patients who are being given this useful sedative over a prolonged period is recommended.",

Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

      "title": "The Howling Cortex: Seizures and General Anesthetic Drugs",
      "abstract": "The true incidence of seizures caused by general anesthetic drugs is unknown. Abnormal movements are common during induction of anesthesia, but they may not be indicative of true seizures. Conversely, epileptiform electrocortical activity is commonly induced by enflurane, etomidate, sevoflurane and, to a lesser extent, propofol, but it rarely progresses to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Even \"nonconvulsant\" anesthetic drugs occasionally cause seizures in subjects with preexisting epilepsy. These seizures most commonly occur during induction or emergence from anesthesia, when the anesthetic drug concentration is relatively low. There is no unifying neural mechanism of anesthetic drug-related seizurogenesis. However, there is a growing body of experimental work suggesting that seizures are not caused simply by \"too much excitation,\" but rather by excitation applied to a mass of neurons which are primed to react to the excitation by going into an oscillatory seizure state. Increased gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition can sensitize the cortex so that only a small amount of excitation is required to cause seizures. This has been postulated to occur 1) at the network level by increasing the propensity for reverberation (e.g., by prolongation of the \"inhibitory lag\"), or 2) via different effects on subpopulations of interneurons (\"inhibiting-the-inhibitors\") or 3) at the synaptic level by changing the chloride reversal potential (\"excitatory GABA\"). On the basis of applied neuropharmacology, prevention of anesthetic-drug related seizures would include 1) avoiding sevoflurane and etomidate, 2) considering prophylaxis with adjunctive benzodiazepines (alpha-subunit GABA(A) agonists), or drugs that impair calcium entry into neurons, and 3) using electroencephalogram monitoring to detect early signs of cortical instability and epileptiform activity. Seizures may falsely elevate electroencephalogram indices of depth of anesthesia.",

In this paper, psychogenic movement disorders captured in the WWI film footage ''War Neuroses'' is reanalyzed. <strong>Methods:</strong> Two movement disorders specialists re-examined film images of 21 WWI patients with various and presumed psychogenic manifestations, pre- and post treatment. The film was recorded by Arthur Hurst, a general physician with an interest in neurology. <strong>Results:</strong> All 21 subjects were males, and all presented with symptoms relating to war trauma or a psychological stressor (e.g., being buried, shrapnel wounds, concussion, or trench fever). The most common presenting feature was a gait disorder, either pure or mixed with another movement disorder (15), followed by retrograde amnesia (2), abnormal postures (pure dystonia) (1), facial spasm (1), head tremor (1), ''hyperthyroidism-hyperadrenalism'' (1). Nineteen patients received treatment, and the treatment was identified in nine cases. In most cases, treatment was short and patients improved almost immediately. Occupational therapy was the most common treatment. Other effective methods were hypnosis (1), relaxation (1), passive movements (2), and probable ''persuasion and re-education'' (6). <strong>Discussion:</strong> The high success rate in treating psychogenic disorders in Hurst's film would be considered impressive by modern standards, and has raised doubt in recent years as to whether parts of the film were staged and/or acted.",

They describe difficulties in their ability to manage activities requiring muscle strength or endurance, such as climbing stairs, working with the arms and carrying objects. Reasons for decreased physical capacity in FM may include a low physical activity level of the FM population, especially regarding strenuous activities and exercise [2]. Activity-induced pain is a common feature in FM [3], which often leads to further avoidance of activity and further exercise intolerance. Other reasons for muscle weakness in FM might be pathological changes within muscle fibers. Findings of moth-eaten and ragged-red fibers in type-I muscle fibers indicate uneven distribution and proliferation of mitochondria [4]. Atrophy of type-II fibers is common in FM, while no signs of degeneration or inflammation have been demonstrated [4]. Microcirculation in muscles during dynamic and static work is reduced in FM [5]. This may lead to sensitization of the intramuscular nociceptors [4]. In addition, electromyography studies during muscle activation have found altered pattern of electromyography activation in patients with FM when compared with healthy persons, while it is not clear if the altered neuromuscular control sustains pain or if it is a result of pain [6]. Patients with FM react with early exhaustion during muscle activity due to changes in central processing [7]. In addition, dysfunction of the growth-hormone axis, found in one-third of patients with FM, may contribute to muscle weakness [8].",

      "abstract": "An hypothesis on the mechanism of pain attacks in trigeminal neuralgia is presented. It is based on the analysis of clinical characteristics and pathology of a series of 278 cases submitted to different methods of treatment, and on physiological data of the literature. The hypothesis is that trigeminal neuralgia is a sort of sensory reflex epilepsy. The posterior root, damaged and distorted by a vessel or compressed by other lesions shows demyelination, micro-neuromas, and so on. At the site of this chronic damage ectopic impulses and afterdischarges are generated; the gasserian ganglion cells too give rise to spontaneous impulse generation. Owing to this chronic anomalous afferent barrage, an epileptic subliminal focus is \"kindled\" in the trigeminal nucleus. The pain paroxysms develop when this subliminal activity is driven in prolonged seizure discharges by peripheral (trigger zone stimulation) or other (not perceived) afferences. Clinical characteristics of the attacks (triggering by innocuous stimulations; persistence of pain after stimulus stops; diffusion of pain outside the stimulated division; refractory period after each paroxysm; increase in frequency of the attacks up to an epileptic-like status; sensibility to carbamazepine and phenytoin) and recurrence following diverse procedures are discussed on the basis of experimental research in reflex epilepsy and \"kindling\". If this hypothesis is true, the treatment of choice of trigeminal neuralgia should be a direct approach to the posterior fossa in order to relieve neurovascular compression which, in more than 75% of the cases, is the causative factor of the disease.",

      "title": "Clinical Management of Constipation",
      "abstract": "First, it is important to find out whether the patient is complaining of infrequent defaecation, excessive straining at defaecation, abdominal pain or bloating, a general sense of malaise attributed to constipation, soiling, or a combination of more than one symptom. Second, one must decide if there is a definable abnormality as a cause of the symptom(s). Is the colon apparently normal or is its lumen widened (megacolon)? Is the upper gut normal or is there evidence of neuropathy or myopathy? Is the anorectum normal or is there evidence of a weak pelvic floor, mucosal prolapse, major rectocele, an internal intussusception or solitary rectal ulcer? Is there any systemic component such as hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia, neurological or psychiatric disorder or relevant drug therapy? Choice of treatment will depend on this clinical evaluation. The range of treatments available is: Reassurance and stop current treatment: Patients with a bowel obsession may take laxatives or rectal preparations regularly without need. Increase dietary fibre: Most cases of 'simple' constipation respond to increased dietary fibre, possibly with an added supplement of natural bran. Toilet training and altered routine of life: Young people particularly may need to recognise the call to stool and alter their daily routine to permit and encourage regular defaecation. Medicinal bulking agent: Ispaghula, methyl cellulose, concentrated wheat germ or bran, and similar preparations are useful when patients with a normal colon find it difficult to take adequate dietary fibre. These preparations increase the bulk of stool and soften its consistency. They may be useful for those patients with the constipated form of irritable bowel syndrome. Additional bulk does not help patients with megacolon or severe idiopathic slow transit constipation. Osmotic laxatives or saline perfusion: Preparations of magnesium hydroxide or sulphate, sodium sulphate, or mannitol soften the stool and if taken in sufficient quantity produce a liquid stool. Magnesium hydroxide is a useful mild laxative for use in childhood. Patients with idiopathic megacolon need to keep the stools liquid with an osmotic laxative. Stimulant laxatives: Anthranoid preparations, bisacodyl and its derivatives are used occasionally by many patients and regularly by some patients with severe idiopathic slow transit constipation. Prokinetic drugs: Can be helpful as a supplement to laxatives. Rectal preparations: Useful particularly for emptying the rectum in childhood and elderly patients with rectal impaction and soiling. Biofeedback: Biofeedback training to increase rectal sensitivity to distension, relax the pelvic floor and increase the effectiveness of straining is proving beneficial for some patients with slow transit constipation and many of those with marked paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor including children with soiling. Psychological: Certain patients, for example those with 'denied bowel actions' or eating disorders need primary psychiatric treatment. Other patients, for example those with a history of sexual abuse, may need it as a supportive measure. Surgery: Surgery is needed for aganglionosis, a few patients with idiopathic megacolon or idiopathic slow transit constipation or pseudoobstruction, and for those with severe rectal mucosal prolapse.",

      "title": "A Case of Amelioration of Venlafaxine-Discontinuation “Brain Shivers” With Atomoxetine",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a common syndrome seen following abrupt termination of treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.1 It occurs at rates ranging from 17.2% to as high as 78% with venlafaxine.2,3 There is, however, little literature on “brain shivers,”4,5 a common antidepressant-discontinuation symptom described by patients taking venlafaxine, duloxetine, citalopram, and paroxetine. Much of the information comes from Internet blogs and Web sites.6–8 The symptom is described variously as “an electrical shock–like sensation in the brain,” “the sensation of the brain shivering,” “brain zaps,” “brain shocks,” “brain shivers,” “head shocks,” or “cranial zings.” The etiology of the symptom is not known, and there is no known treatment for this distressing symptom.\r\n\r\nWe describe a case in which “brain shivers” occurred as part of venlafaxine discontinuation syndrome and abated with atomoxetine treatment.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 34-year-old man, presented with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) that responded well to venlafaxine (300 mg/d). He achieved remission except for seasonal exacerbations during autumn during the next 4 years. In view of a family history of bipolar disorder, it was decided to add lamotrigine and taper venlafaxine. Mr A maintained remission on venlafaxine (37.5 mg/d) and lamotrigine (200 mg/d) without seasonal exacerbations. Mr A abruptly discontinued venlafaxine 37.5 mg/d. On the second day following discontinuation, he reported feeling an unpleasant sensation of “electricity in the head” that “felt like the brain was shaking inside the skull.” Mr A was also noticed to demonstrate emotional incontinence and complained of anhedonia, anxiety, tinnitus, headache, nausea, and increased sensitivity to noise. Since the “brain shivers” were the most distressing symptom, a trial of atomoxetine 40 mg/d was attempted based on the hypothesis that the symptom was a result of noradrenergic imbalance.9 An immediate improvement in “brain shivers” was reported within 2 or 3 hours of taking the first dose. Over the next 3 days, Mr A reported further improvement in “brain shivers” and anhedonia although emotional incontinence and increased sensitivity to noise persisted. Given the severity of other withdrawal symptoms, venlafaxine (37.5 mg/d) was reinstated and atomoxetine was stopped. All withdrawal symptoms disappeared during the next day.\r\n\r\nThe case adds to the interesting speculation about the noradrenergic imbalance as the basis of “brain shivers.”9 “Brain shivers,” conceptually related to Lhermitte’s phenomenon,10 have also been reported with the noradrenergic drug 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA). The psychotropic effects of MDMA are mediated via norepinephrine transporter11 and results in an increase in synaptic norepinephrine levels. Venlafaxine’s affinity for norepinephrine transporter (K[i] = 2,984 nM),12 is 103-fold lower than that of atomoxetine (K[i] = 5 nM),13 yet venlafaxine causes an increase (242%)14 in synaptic norepinephrine levels comparable to that by atomoxetine (290% ± 33%).13 Curiously, chronic treatment with venlafaxine does not reduce norepinephrine transporter binding sites.15 These facts point to the possibility that increases in synaptic norepinephrine are due to norepinephrine transporter reversal, akin to dopamine transporter reversal associated with amphetamine.16 Abrupt withdrawal of venlafaxine would hence result in paradoxical increase in synaptic norepinephrine via efflux through norepinephrine transporter channels, which is normalized by atomoxetine’s norepinephrine transporter blockade. This speculation of the noradrenergic basis of “brain shivers” warrants further study.",

      "title": "Quick Consult: Symptoms: ‘Twisting’ Head and Eyes",
      "abstract": "ImageA 48-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining that her head and eyes are “turning.” She admits to recent nausea and vomiting, and says she took Compazine the day before for symptom relief. Today she is unable to control her head movements, and her neck is twisting to the right. She also claims to have difficulty closing her mouth when eating, and says she “can't control” her eyes. She denies seizure activity, fever, head trauma, dysphagia, weakness, paresthesias, and a recent dirty wound. She does admit, however, to recent cocaine use. What condition are you concerned about, and how would you treat it? Diagnosis: Medication-Induced Acute Dystonic Reaction Dystonia is the involuntary, sustained contraction of a muscle group that causes twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. (Lancet Neurol 2006;5[9]:780.) These contractions can have overlying spasms, and be exaggerated in certain positions or with certain movements (writing, golfing). Dystonic movements can be differentiated from essential tremor because the spasm is typically in the same rotary direction. Dystonia can be a feature of tardive dyskinesia, a delayed onset movement disorder that typically develops after prolonged use of dopamine receptor blocking agents. Dystonias are not typically life-threatening, but can cause significant morbidity. The classification of dystonia is primarily by anatomic distribution, age of onset, and etiology. (Adv Neurol 2004;94:101.) Many body areas can be affected, and can be focal (one body area), segmental (two or more contiguous body areas), generalized (leg, trunk, and one additional body area), multifocal (two or more noncontiguous body areas), or a hemidystonia (one side of the body), which is rare. Patients under 26 with dystonia are typically considered “early onset;” over 26 are “late onset.” Early onset cases tend to present with unilateral limb involvement, but become generalized in 50 percent to 90 percent. Late onset tends to remain focal or segmental. (Mov Disord 1995;10[2]:143.) Approximately 50 percent of dystonias are primary, which do not result from an identifiable cause or neurological abnormality. Symptoms tend to develop slowly, but intellect and cognition remain intact despite progression to significant movement abnormalities. At least 15 genetic subtypes of primary dystonia have been identified. (Nat Genet 1997;17[1]:40; Nat Genet 2009;41[3]:286.) Focal dystonia is thought to be 10 times more common than generalized form, with cervical dystonia (neck and shoulder involvement) the most common. (Lancet Neurol 2004;3[11]: 673.) Secondary dystonia is associated with weakness, ataxia, abnormal ocular movements, seizure, or cognition problems, and results from an insult. It can be the result of neonatal brain injury, heavy metal poisoning, exposure to medications (particularly neuroleptics or antipsychotics), or trauma, among other causes. Onset after insult can be in hours or years. Medication-induced acute dystonias commonly present to the ED, where they are easily treatable. These types of reactions typically occur after initiation a dopamine-blocking neuroleptic, with 50 percent of cases occurring within 72 hours and 90 percent within five days. Other risk factors include a previous history of alcohol or cocaine use (Am J Emerg Med 1997;15[5]:513), and previous personal or family history. Presentation depends on the body part involved, but is often associated with pain from cramping and sustained involuntary muscle contractions. Focal dystonia can present as torticollis (neck), blepharospasm (eyelids), oromandibular (tongue protrusion, jaw clenching, etc.), dysphonia (most commonly, whispering and breathy voice [Adv Neurol 1998;78:237]), oculogyric crisis, or from an activity (writer's cramp). (Br J Hosp Med 1993;50[2-3]:91.) One form is associated with Parkinson's disease so those features may be present. (Arch Neurol 2004;61[12]:1956.) The physical examination should include a thorough neurological examination and an ophthalmologic examination if indicated. Patients with primary or drug-induced acute dystonia should not have any cognitive impairment. Patients with dystonia commonly present with a sensory tick or “geste antagoniste.” Slight sensory stimulation can reduce or overcome dystonic symptoms. No laboratory or neuroimaging study is pathognomonic. (Ann Neurol 1998; 44[3]:303.) Observation by a movement disorder specialist may be necessary to make the diagnosis. Laboratory studies such as CBC and renal function and imaging such as brain CT or MRI, however, may identify underlying etiologies. Evaluation for rhabdomyolysis secondary to sustained muscle contraction is also prudent. The differential diagnosis of dystonia includes Tourette syndrome, Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, Huntington's disease, seizure, tetanus, Wilson's disease, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, conversion disorder, medication toxicity, and strychnine toxicity. Treatment of secondary dystonia addresses underlying etiology, but treatment of primary dystonia is supportive. Oral medications can be used, including levodopa (reported to improve symptoms in nearly all cases with dopa-responsive dystonia [Parkinsonism Relat Disord 2001; 89(1):1]), anticholenergic medications, baclofen, and clonazepam. (Clin Neuropharmacol 1992;15[4]:276; Adv Neurol 1988;50:547.) Intravenous anticholenergic agents or diphenhydramine are the treatment of choice for acute medication-induced dystonic reactions, with symptom resolution usually within 10 minutes. Intramuscular administration is acceptable if IV administration is delayed or unobtainable, but may take longer for symptom relief. Treatment medications may be repeated as needed. Benzodiazepines may be indicated for refractory cases. Patients should be observed to ensure no relapse occurs, and can be discharged with a two- to three-day course of medication to prevent relapse. Patients should be instructed to discontinue the offending medication that caused the dystonia. Patient prognosis depends on age of onset (younger patients have worse ones) and how much of the body is affected (generalized condition purports worse one). This patient was given diphenhydramine in the ED, and observed with no return of symptoms.Dr. Wiler: is an assistant clinical professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine and an adjunct assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.",

      "title": "Neurogenic Positional Pedal Neuritis",
      "abstract": "Neurogenic positional pedal neuritis is a presentation of neuritic symptoms in one or both feet usually affected by body position, specifically, the position of the spine. Its etiology is similar to that of neurogenic-induced claudication caused by spinal stenosis in that the symptoms are caused by compression or irritation of nerves of the lower lumbosacral spine, usually the fifth lumbar and first sacral nerve roots. Burning, stabbing, a cold feeling, aching, numbness, paresthesia, or a weak or tired feeling of the feet (during some part of the disease process) depend on spinal position and may occur during standing, walking, or even lying in bed. Symptoms may be severe and are often eliminated by lumbosacral spine flexion, such as by walking with wheeled support such as a grocery cart or walker; less frequently by negative-heel shoe modification, which can change the position of the lumbosacral spine in stance; or by alteration of sleeping position. This condition, which can include loss of protective sensation, is often misdiagnosed as neuropathy (especially in diabetic patients) or less frequently as biomechanical in origin. In diabetic patients, this condition is frequently the cause of failure of monochromatic infrared energy therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Treatment is aimed at reducing the spinal nerve or nerve root irritation. Clear definition of the pedal symptoms of spinal nerve compression within a single diagnostic category should facilitate identification and treatment. (J Am Podiatr Med Assoc 93(3): 174-184, 2003)",

A higher degree of specificity might have: chiefly fear of failure, susceptibility, and tension, secondarily emotivity, fear of unpredictable events, sense of insufficient time, preoccupation with authority factors, and tendency to endure unacceptable situations, and also faulty patience and lack of punctuality. Rumination appears to be the psychological tendency most strongly associated with FD. Nocturnal epigastric pain seems to indicate a submissive nature but a rather responsibilities-free childhood, while early satiety is associated with inclination to work and responsibility and preoccupation with self-image. The superposition of FD symptoms with biliary and esophageal symptoms cast a doubt over the distinctness and even the materiality of the various functional digestive disorders.",

      "title": "Should psychostimulants be used to treat delirious patients with depressed mood?",
      "abstract": "In the past 18 months, there has been considerable controversy regarding the benzodiazepine triazolam (Halcion). To review data supporting or not supporting the assertion that treatment with triazolam results in adverse reactions more frequently than with other benzodiazepines, the author used computerized literature searches (MEDLINE, English language articles from 1975 to the present) to identify reports of behavioral disinhibition, amnesia, delirium, rebound insomnia, and withdrawal reactions on benzodiazepines. Studies of disinhibitory reactions during benzodiazepine treatment do not substantiate the argument that they are more prevalent with triazolam than with other benzodiazepines. The behavioral disinhibition reactions during treatment with benzodiazepines are associated with higher dosages and pretreatment level of hostility. Anterograde amnesia occurs with many benzodiazepines, but usually without changes in a person's normal activities and behaviors. The reports of anterograde amnesia during benzodiazepine treatment describe people performing rather complex tasks during which outside observers could not detect any unusual behaviors. The prevalence of delirium during treatment with triazolam and other benzodiazepines is unclear, but delirium is more frequent at higher dosages and in the elderly. Controlled studies regarding the adverse effects of triazolam on sleep are lacking. The author concludes that despite the considerable adverse publicity in the lay press, there is little scientific evidence that triazolam is associated with disinhibitory or other adverse reactions at a greater frequency than other benzodiazepines.",

A 68-year-old patient was imaged using fMRI during three attacks of a periorbital head-pain with a average duration of 3 min. During the attacks, left sided conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, facial sweating and hypersalivation were apparent. These attacks were usually partly responsive to oxygen administration but otherwise refractory to any drug. The patient described either attacks with a duration of one minute or less or longer attacks persisting for maximum of 20 min with headaches occurring up to 100 times a day. When considering the symptoms, frequency, duration and therapeutic response of the patient's headache, no clear-cut classification to one of the subtypes of trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT) or trigeminal neuralgia was possible. The cerebral activation pattern was similar but not identical to those previously observed in cluster headache and SUNCT with a prominent activation in the hypothalamic grey matter. This case study underlines the conceptual value of the term TAC for the group of headaches focusing around the trigeminal-autonomic reflex. Our results emphasize the importance of the hypothalamus as key region in the pathophysiology of this entity.",

However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications in all but the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles. Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the \"withdrawal triad,\" comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element has been observed consistent with an activation syndrome. This activation syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or as a consequence of initial prodopaminergic drive. All of these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.",

      "abstract": "The advent of compounds that oppose excessive bone resorption is a remarkable advance in the treatment of Paget's disease, the course of which can be controlled, in almost every case, by calcitonin and bisphosphonates. This treatment aims at limiting the hypertrophy and deformation of bones, thereby reducing the incidence of neurosensory and orthopaedic complications, principal causes of disablement. It follows that those forms of the disease that are characterized by strong biochemical activity and/or bone lesions resulting in neurosensory suffering of articular impairment of the lower limbs must be treated actively. In every case, vitamin D or calcium deficiencies likely to induce hyperparathyroidism must be corrected. Orthopaedic appliances on long bones or lower limb articulations are sometimes necessary. New drugs (e.g. bisphosphonates with greater activity) and different pharmaceutical preparations or modes of administration (e.g. short parenteral courses of bisphosphonates, calcitonin in nasal spray) might soon increase the possibilities of treatment and provide an even better control of Paget's disease of bone.",

      "abstract": "Adverse reactions and toxicity inevitably accompany all treatment courses for drug-resistant TB. Our case underscores the importance of awareness regarding neuropsychiatric adverse reactions due to MDR-TB therapy and reversible nature of it. Cycloserine induced psychosis is most life threatening complication and sometimes could be fatal. A 42-year-old male on MDR-TB therapy got admitted for his persistent psychotic complaints like hallucinations, delusions and suicidal ideations, despite being treated with quetiapine/olanzapine. Eventually patient was rehabilitated, cycloserine was stopped and psychotic events regressed slowly. Other culprit drugs like ethambutol and levofloxacin causing psychosis was ruled out because there was no relapse of psychotic events despite being continued with these drugs. He also complained of tingling, numbness, swaying, pain and weakness. On examination, he had distal motor weakness in lower limbs, tandem gait positive, altered position sense, and tenderness over toes and positive Romberg's sign with ataxia. He was diagnosed to have drug induced sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. All these symptoms persisted after stopping cycloserine and patient continued to have neuropathy with ethambutol and ethionamide. Considering the nature of neuropathy which was mild, mixed sensorimotor and resolved completely after 2-3 weeks of stopping, it was more in favour of ethambutol. However, we could not rule out the possibility of ethionamide or (ethionamide + ethambutol) causing neuropathy or both could have accelerated the neurotoxic effects of cycloserine which remained elusive.",

      "title": "Aripiprazole-Induced Parkinsonism in a Child",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Parkinsonism is a neurologic syndrome that manifests as any combination of 6 cardinal features: tremor at rest, rigidity, bradykinesia/hypokinesia, flexed posture, loss of postural reflexes, and the freezing phenomenon.1 At least 2 of these features, with at least 1 being either tremor at rest or bradykinesia, must be present for a definitive diagnosis of parkinsonism.1 The biochemical abnormality in parkinsonism is reduced dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.1\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Steck2 first described neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism in patients taking chlorpromazine. This observation was confirmed by Gade and Heinrich3 in 1955. The prevalence of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism is difficult to ascertain because of heterogenous patient populations, variable drug regimens, and other factors that make this distinction extremely difficult. In most cases, however, it is second only to Parkinson's disease as the most common cause of parkinsonism.4,5,6 Various medications such as neuroleptics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, lithium, valproic acid, calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmics, procholinergics, chemotherapeutics, amphotericin B, estrogen, and others have been implicated.4 To our knowledge, we are reporting the first published case of aripiprazole-induced parkinsonism.\r\n\r\nCase report. A 12-year-old white boy presented to the emergency department in 2010 with chief complaints of excessive drooling, generalized slowing of body movements, and difficulty in walking with stiffness in arms and legs for 3 days. His psychiatric history was significant for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; nightmares, flashbacks, numbing, avoidance, and sexually acting-out behavior) due to physical and sexual abuse, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and mood disorder not otherwise specified (longstanding history of mood dysregulation, mood swings, and excessive irritability). On mental status examination, he described his mood as “sad.” His affect was blunted, his speech was limited to short response, and he denied having audiovisual hallucinations. He was not delirious. On physical examination, he was found to have bradykinesia, lip smacking, flexed posture, and cogwheel rigidity. There was no past history of illicit substance or alcohol abuse. There was no family history of movement disorders.\r\n\r\nHis outpatient medications included lisdexamfetamine 70 mg orally every morning and guanfacine 1 mg orally every morning. Within 3 days of initiation of benztropine 1 mg orally twice daily and aripiprazole 5 mg/d orally, he developed classic parkinsonian symptoms, ie, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, and flexed posture. After emergency department stabilization, he was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit with an additional diagnosis of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. Findings from his routine blood work including complete blood cell count with differential, comprehensive metabolic profile, and drug screen as well as noncontrast head computed tomography scan were within normal limits. All medications were stopped except benztropine 1 mg orally twice daily, and amantadine 100 mg orally twice daily was given, which led to symptom resolution within 72 hours. After release from the hospital, he was rechallenged with an antipsychotic, quetiapine extended release (XR) 50 mg orally every evening, with reemergence of parkinsonian symptoms. Quetiapine XR was discontinued, with dramatic resolution of parkinsonian symptoms.\r\n\r\nA PubMed search for the years 1954 to 2010 with the keywords antipsychotics, aripiprazole, parkinsonism, and children was performed, and a Google Scholar search incorporating the same keywords and range of years was also conducted. To our knowledge, only 2 casereports of drug-induced parkinsonism in children7,8 have been published.\r\n\r\nNeuroleptic-induced parkinsonism results from a diminution in dopamine activity.9 This can be induced by depletion of dopamine in presynaptic stores (eg, during reserpine treatment), dopamine-blocking agents (eg, antipsychotics), and the atypical calcium-blocking agent cinnarizine.9 Dopamine-2 blockade in nigrostriatal dopamine system results in parkinsonian symptoms in patients who are taking antipsychotics.10 This effect is frequent with typical antipsychotics, being strong D2 blockers, compared to atypical antipsychotics, which are relatively weak D2 blockers.11 Absence of tremor and reversibility are typical of drug-induced parkinsonism rather than Parkinson's disease.12\r\n\r\nThis syndrome usually subsides with dose reduction or medication cessation.9 As such reduction or cessation is not always possible, alternative strategies include switching from a high-potency D2 blocking agent (eg, fluphenazine) to a lower-potency first-generation antipsychotic or second-generation antipsychotic agent (eg, quetiapine). According to the literature, aripiprazole, a partial D2 agonist, may also decrease the risk of acute extrapyramidal symptoms.9 Adjunctive anticholinergic agents, eg, benztropine or dopamine agonists such as amantadine, are effective agents to alleviate extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).9\r\n\r\nPhysicians should look for the symptoms of parkinsonism and movement disorders in children who are on treatment with antipsychotics, either typical or atypical. Incidence of EPS appears to be greater for typical antipsychotics. Among atypical antipsychotics, hierarchy of EPS risk is risperidone > olanzapine = ziprasidone = aripiprazole > quetiapine > clozapine.10,13 If challenged by a neuroleptic again, patients may have reemergence of parkinsonian symptoms.",

Only a small portion of the total energy reaches the intra-cranial contents and this apparently spreads through the cerebrum and deeper structures. Whether the effects noted are the result of action on the diencephalon or some specific portion of it is still an unresolved question. Electrostimulation is a safe, simple procedure particularly useful for outpatient treatment. Suggestions for making the procedure more practical are outlined. The immediate posttreatment period is particularly amenable to psychotherapeutic exploration and psychotherapy. Maintenance treatment can be continued for long periods without deleterious side-effects. The chief areas of usefulness are in certain paranoid schizophrenics, anxiety states, psychosomatic conditions, epilepsy in conjunction with standard anticonvulsant medication, and finally in combating the lethargic confused state resulting from either barbiturate action or convulsive therapy.",

All the patients described had been taking hallucinogenic drugs for over five years. Only three of several successfully treated cases are described. Two of these cases were followed by EEG recordings, which did not show any localized epileptiform activity. The response to diphenylhydantoin is described both clinically and as recorded by EEG. An initial two-week period is necessary in order that the effects of the drugs can be demonstrated clinically or on EEG tracing. It cannot be concluded from this that the antiepileptic drugs are the drugs of choice in drug-induced psychosis; but, diphenylhydantoin has shown dramatic effectiveness in these previously refractory cases. In view of the response, some abnormal cerebral discharge from an as yet undiscovered locus may be involved in the pathogenesis of drug-induced hallucinations.",

Furthermore, in laboratory studies pramipexole has proved to exert neuroprotector effects and its use in clinical practice from the early stages of the disease has been related to a delay in the appearance of motor complications (fluctuations and dyskinesias). It has recently been shown that it is especially valuable in the treatment of tremors and is also effective in improving certain non-motor symptoms such as depression. Pramipexole is free of the severe side effects (fibrosis and valve disease) linked with ergotic dopaminergic agonists and causes fewer digestive and dysautonomic alterations. Other undesirable side effects of treatment with non-ergotic agonists, such as hallucinations, the appearance of oedemas and drowsiness, can be minimised by carefully selecting the patients. Further studies need to be conducted to help define the long-term effects of dopaminergic agonists on the progress of the disease and also to show the differences between non-ergotic agonists in clinical practice.",

Almost all antidepressants are associated with sexual side effects that go above and beyond any symptoms that can be explained by the disease process itself. The incidence of such sexual side effects can be as high as 92% for some antidepressants. Some of the newer antidepressants currently on the market seem to have a lower incidence of sexual dysfunction as a side effect. In view of the fairly common occurrence of these unwanted effects, and their potential contribution to noncompliance, careful selection of antidepressant medications is necessary. A variety of treatment options is available, including decreasing the dosage of medication to the lowest-effective level, adjunctive medications (such as cyproheptadine, bethanechol, yohimbine, and amantadine, as well as other antidepressants) to counteract the adverse sexual effects, or switching to another antidepressant. The treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction requires a creative approach on the part of the treating psychiatrist, and must be individualized to the patient.",

      "abstract": "Functional seizures, a primary subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND), are a known cause of serious neurological disability with an increasing awareness of their impact amongst the neuroscience community. Situated at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry, FND is characterized by a range of alterations in motor, sensory or cognitive performance, such as abnormal movements, limb weakness, and dissociative, seizure-like episodes. Functional seizures are known, in part, to have psychological underpinnings; however, the lack of effective and consistent treatment options requires research and novel approaches to better understand the etiology, diagnosis and what constitutes a successful intervention. Ketamine, a selective blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, has a well-established safety and efficacy profile. In recent years, ketamine-assisted therapy has shown increasing potential for treating a broad range of psychiatric conditions, building on its demonstrated rapid-acting antidepressant effects. Here we present a 51-year-old female with refractory daily functional seizures leading to significant disability and a medical history significant for major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After unsuccessful treatment attempts, the patient underwent a novel protocol with ketamine-assisted therapy. After 3 weeks of ketamine-assisted therapy followed by 20 weeks of intermittent ketamine treatment and ongoing integrative psychotherapy, the patient's seizures were significantly reduced in frequency and severity. She experienced significant improvements in depressive symptoms and functional ability scores. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case describing improvement in functional seizures following ketamine-assisted therapy. While rigorous studies are needed, this case report encourages further investigation of ketamine-assisted therapy for functional seizures and other functional neurological symptoms.",

Presentations with psychotic symptoms have been described less frequently. In this report we present the case of a young boy with Wilson's disease who developed psychotic symptoms. A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease on the basis of the physical examination findings and low ceruloplasmin levels (8.1 mg/dl). After 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute onset illness, characterized by delusion of persecution, fearfulness, hypervigilence and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with any confusion, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations and affective symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. One week after the onset of the symptoms he was prescribed tab penicillamine, initially 250 mg/day, which was increased to 500 mg/day after 3 days. After increase in the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to hospitalization. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder (F06.2) due to Wilson's disease was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started, and the dose of penicillamine was reduced with which symptoms resolved. Whenever a young adolescent develops psychosis, especially of delusional type, the possibility of Wilson's disease must be considered.",

Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner.

      "abstract": "Hashimoto Encephalopathy, more accurately known as Steroid Responsive Encephalopathy associated with Autoimmune Thyroiditis (SREAT), is an exceedingly rare and often controversial diagnosis that, when present, manifests as encephalopathy with a variety of other potential symptoms in the setting of elevated antithyroid peroxidase antibody and/or antithyroglobulin antibody. Its manifestations can include encephalopathy, seizures, myoclonus, hallucinations, stroke-like findings, and more. We present the case of a 39-year-old transgender man with autistic spectrum disorder and depression, initially presumed to be in acute psychiatric decompensation, later found to have elevated levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies, who responded well to plasma exchange (PLEX) and rituximab. On initial psychiatric admission, the patient had symptoms of suicidal ideation, confusion, and agitation. He showed little improvement on medications such as quetiapine, olanzapine, valproate, and bupropion. Due to worsening agitation and cognitive impairment, he required further medical and neurological evaluation. He later had an episode deemed to be a likely seizure. This workup included electroencephalogram (EEG), MRI Brain, and lumbar puncture, yet all were unremarkable. Laboratory values were notable for elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies of 661 U/mL. The patient received intravenous high-dose steroids with transient improvement. He eventually responded dramatically to plasmapheresis. At his post-discharge follow up, he had returned to his cognitive baseline. He successfully resumed his job and has since remained at his functional baseline. This case is the first to our knowledge to characterize a novel presentation of SREAT mimicking malignant excited catatonia. In such cases, if initial response to glucocorticoid treatment is equivocal, plasma exchange may be an effective treatment option.",

      "title": "Intensive Care Unit Neuromuscular Syndrome?",
      "abstract": "Accepted for publication May 1, 1995.Key words: Complications. Neuromuscular blocking drugs. Prolonged infusion.Causes of motor dysfunction of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) include neuropathies, [1]myopathies, neuromuscular diseases (myasthesia gravis, myasthenic syndrome), dysregulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs; burn), [2]nutritional and electrolyte imbalance (Li sup +, Mg sup ++, Ca sup ++, PhO4sup --, Na sup +, K sup +), [3]acid-base abnormalities, hypoxia, fatigue, reperfusion injury, [4]steroids, antibiotics, lesions of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and disuse and immobilization atrophies. [5]Any of these conditions may result in ICU patients responding to neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) less predictably than do healthy surgical subjects.Despite the unpredictable effect and the great number of conditions complicating their use, NMBDs are used in the ICU frequently, in large doses, and often for a duration much longer than in the operating suite. [5-11]Furthermore, the cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, and central nervous systems take priority over the neuromuscular system, which receives little attention except when it is already diseased. Personnel in the ICU receive inadequate training in the pharmacology and management of NMBDs. [8,12]In contrast with the meticulous choice of drug and dosage and the standard of monitoring in the operating suite, personnel in the ICU seem to settle for one favorite drug (pancuronium, vecuronium, atracurium) administered according to one dosing formula and do not monitor the effect or monitor it infrequently. If NMBDs will cause complications, these are the ideal conditions.The pharmacology of neuromuscular transmission as it pertains to the use of NMBDs in the ICU received little attention until prolonged paralysis after cessation of long-term use of NMBDs was described in numerous reports, national surveys, [9,13,14]and reviews. [5,10,15]Miller was personally aware of 45 cases of prolonged responses to NMBDs in 5 yr.* In a report of 12 cases, one patient received 2,780 mg vecuronium over 25 days, at an average dose of 111 mg per day, during 35 days of mechanical ventilation, resulting in a moderately severe motor weakness that took 3 months to resolve. [6]In another report, [7]a patient received 7,728 mg vecuronium over 30 days after a lung transplant and required 4 months to regain most of her strength. As is usual of iatrogenic complications, awareness alone may change the practice. Reported cases of NMBD-induced protracted paralysis may represent only the tip of the iceberg, but the problem already may be lessening. [5,13,14,16]A recent prospective study demonstrated that, by monitoring the neuromuscular transmission and providing adequate sedation and analgesia, smaller doses of pancuronium and pipecuronium than those previously used sufficed, and no prolonged paralysis occurred in a series of 60 ICU patients. [16].Reports describing prolonged paralysis after administration of NMBD to patients in the ICU have varied widely as to the dose and duration of administration of NMBDs, the duration of paralysis, the underlying critical illness, and the neuromuscular pathology. It is possible that the reported cases represent more than one disease entity or none at all. The pathology of NMBD-induced protracted paralysis includes marked atrophy of type I and type II muscle fibers, destructive myopathy, relatively little inflammation, and relatively intact motor and sensory nerves. [6,7]It appears different from the \"critical illness polyneuropathy.\" [1]The disease process is mainly in the muscle. Some of the reported cases have been suspected as simply an exacerbation of one or more existing conditions, e.g., steroid myopathy, altered pharmacokinetics, antibiotic neuromuscular block, or critical illness polyneuropathy. [5,7,11],* If the post-NMBD paralysis can be explained in its entirety as due to pharmacokinetic changes, as has been suggested, [17]the problem represents only a failure to properly modify the use of NMBDs to fit the patient's conditions. However, often this does not seem to be the case. Watling and Dasta divided the reported cases into two categories: pharmacokinetically related and pharmacokinetically unrelated. [15]The pharmacokinetically unrelated cases suggest specific pathology of the neuromuscular structures.Is there a neuromuscular pathology specifically attributable to prolonged action of NMBDs? Prolonged prejunctional and postjunctional actions of NMBDs cause dysregulation of the AChRs of the skeletal muscle. [2,18,19]Botulinum toxin [20]and d-tubocurarine [21]have been shown to increase extrajunctional muscle sensitivity to acetylcholine. Recently, Dodson et al. demonstrated upregulation of AChRs in necropsy muscle samples of deceased critically ill adults [22]who had received long-term, high-dose infusion of vecuronium. NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs may be extensive enough to cause tolerance to NMBDs in the rat [19]and humans* and hyperkalemia after succinylcholine in the rat [23]and possibly humans. [5,24]The dysregulation of AChRs after prolonged exposure to NMBDs is therefore similar to that after traumatic denervation, disuse, or immobilization. However, it may be different from burn-induced dysregulation, with dissimilarities in receptor subunits. [25].It is tempting to ascribe NMBD-induced dysregulation of AChRs of the muscle, the increased sensitivity to acetylcholine, the resistance to d-tubocurarine, and the hyperkalemic response to succinylcholine simply to a \"chemical denervation.\" However, this NMBD-induced dysregulation occurs even without disuse or immobilization, namely without \"chemical denervation.\" Hogue et al. [19]have demonstrated tolerance and upregulation of AChRs after chronic infusion of d-tubocurarine in rats even at minimally or non-neuromuscular blocking doses. The hyperkalemic reaction to succinylcholine observed by Yanez et al. [23]occurred even after nonimmobilizing doses of d-tubocurarine. NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs, therefore, differs from traumatic denervation in at least one aspect: Besides secondarily to \"chemical denervation,\" NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs may be a primary drug action.Does NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs, as a primary drug action or secondary to disuse, cause or contribute to the pathogenesis of the post-NMBD myopathy and motor dysfunction? In this issue, Kim et al. [26]report that prolonged infusion of d-tubocurarine accentuates burn-induced upregulation of AChRs in the rat. This study provides a critical link between NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs and that of at least one disease process of patients in the ICU (burn). Synergism between NMBD-induced dysregulation of AChRs (A) and other underlying dysregulation processes (B) might be a major determinant (C) of whether the dysregulation will become severe enough to actually progress to myopathies and protracted paralysis in the critically ill. In this regard, the report of Kim et al. is an important step toward understanding the post-NMBD protracted paralysis of the critically ill. It allows NMBDs to play a partial role. It allows the assumption that patients with certain underlying pathologies (if severe enough) may be more prone to the complication than those without. Conversely, it allows the assumption that sufficient action of NMBDs or sufficient AChR dysregulation is required to consummate a clinically significant motor impairment. [16,22]Finally, upregulation of AChRs may hypothetically be the common specific pathologic process of all post-NMBD protracted paralysis, regardless of the underlying critical illness.Controversies are bound to follow, and many unanswered questions need urgent attention. Clinically, NMBD-induced dysregulation of AchRs occurs in ICU patients. [22]Are the receptor changes and the clinical pathology causally related? If they are, how does the dysregulation cause the myopathy and the motor dysfunction? What is the dose-response relationship? Are the various NMBDs different? Cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia after administration of succinylcholine has been reported to occur in ICU patients who had no previously recognized predisposing factors except a presumed relative disuse due to ICU confinement. [5,24]However, the exact role of NMBD-induced dysregulation of AChRs in hyperkalemia cannot be assessed from these case reports. Tolerance and increasing requirement of NMBDs have been observed clinically but only sporadically. [5],* Given this preliminary evidence, could the clinical disease in question be an \"ICU neuromuscular syndrome\" of protracted paralysis, altered sensitivity to the curariform NMBDs, and susceptibility to succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia, all based on the common mechanism of NMBD-induced upregulation of AChRs? Could the dysregulation-mediated ICU neuromuscular syndrome, as herein defined, be just one variety of NMBD-related prolonged paralysis, which in turn accounts for only part of all prolonged paralysis of the critically ill? The term ICU neuromuscular syndrome is intended to stress its primarily neuromuscular, not neural or muscular, origin and mechanism. Without first somehow defining a problem or part of a problem, the incidence, prevalence, and exact dose requirement of the problem will be confusing. Other unanswered questions include the exact nature of these abnormal AChRs. Does dysregulation of AChRs occur also prejunctionally? AChRs are present at the motor nerve terminal, [27]and \"very distal denervation\" [6]of the motor nerve has been observed in patients.Finally, I agree with Coursin [28]and Fiamengo and Savarese [29]that each use of an NMBD in the ICU deserves careful thought in terms of indication, selection, dose, and duration. Excessive reliance on NMBDs should be discouraged. Although still unconfirmed, reducing the dose and duration of administration of NMBDs probably will lessen the risk of prolonged paralysis. [16]Monitoring of neuromuscular transmission is essential, especially in critically ill patients who have numerous reasons to respond abnormally and one new reason to be hurt by NMBDs. Many monitoring methods are available, [30]but even the simplest method (e.g., train-of-four count [31]) applied occasionally but regularly may help avoid gross overdose. Most pharmacokinetically related cases [15]probably could have been prevented by careful monitoring. Unfortunately, even subparalytic doses of NMBDs might suffice to dysregulate AChRs and accentuate the process. [19,26]The safe dose may vary from patient to patient and relaxant to relaxant. Some patients, as has been suspected of those with septicemia and steroid neuropathy, may be particularly susceptible. Until further clarified, therefore, it is advisable to go one step further and refrain from using NMBDs whenever they are dispensable or replaceable. If this is not possible, periodic interruption of NMBD administration, pharmacokinetic study and correlation between the neuromuscular transmission and the serum concentration of NMBD, and neurologic and electrophysiologic studies may be useful in the early detection of a potentially devastating complication.Chingmuh Lee, M.D. Professor and Chairman, Department of Anesthesiology, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, Harbor/University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center Campus, 1000 West Carson Street, Torrance, California 90509* Miller RD: Use of muscle relaxants in non-operating room locations: International Anesthesia Research Society 1993 review course lectures. 6-9, 1993.",

      "abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs have an important place in pharmacologic treatment of depression. Major depression with psychotic features responds poorly to treatment if an antipsychotic is not used in addition to an antidepressant; however, an antipsychotic confers no additional benefit in nonpsychotic depression. Antipsychotic drugs do have significant short- and long-term side effects, including pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. The possibility of a good therapeutic response with minimal side effects can be increased if psychotic depression is diagnosed accurately and the antipsychotic is prescribed according to established clinical guidelines.",

The merits of the method are not only due to the beneficial effects of the relaxant itself; the anaesthetic, that is invariably administered at the same time, plays an essential part in the procedure. Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

      "title": "The Role of Peripheral Input for Chronic Pain Syndromes like Fibromyalgia Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Clinical symptoms of chronic muscle conditions like fibromyalgia syndrome [FMS], include pain, stiffness, subjective weakness, and muscle fatigue. Muscle pain in FMS is usually described as fluctuating and always associated with local or generalized tenderness [hyperalgesia and/or allodynia]. This tenderness related to muscle pain depends on increased peripheral and/or central nervous system responsiveness to peripheral stimuli that can be either noxious [hyperalgesia] or nonnoxious [allodynia]. For example, patients with muscle hyperalgesia will rate painful muscle stimuli higher than normal controls, whereas patients with allodynia may perceive light touch as painful, something that a “normal” individual will never describe as painful. The pathogenesis of such peripheral and/or central nervous system changes in FMS is unclear, but peripheral tissue changes, specifically in muscles have been implicated.Findings: Indirect evidence from interventions that attenuate tonic peripheral pain impulses in patients with FMS suggest that overall FMS pain is dependent on peripheral input. More important, allodynia and hyperalgesia can be improved or abolished by removal of peripheral impulse input. Another potential mechanism for FMS pain is central disinhibition. However, this pain mechanism also depends on tonic impulse input, even if only inadequately inhibited. Thus a promising approach to understanding FMS pain is to determine whether abnormal activity of receptors in deep tissues is fundamental to the development and maintenance of this chronic pain disorder.Conclusions: Most FMS patients present with focal tissue abnormalities including myofascial trigger points, ligamentous trigger points, or osteoarthritis of the joints and spine. Though not predictive for the development of FMS, these changes nevertheless represent important pain generators that may initiate or perpetuate chronic pain. Local chemical mediators, including lactic acid, amino acids, and cytokines could play an important role in sensitizing deep tissue nociceptors of FMS patients. Thus the combination of peripheral impulse input and increased central pain sensitivity may be responsible for widespread chronic pain as reported in FMS.",

It is indicated that although completed studies are sparse and although many of the techniques currently used for evaluating the effects of such drugs on patients are inadequate, certain conclusions may be drawn. With regard to the effects on cognitive abilities, the drugs not only impair performance on psychological tests, but some drugs—particularly phenytoin—are associated with a progressive decline of intellectual abilities, which is often insidious and unrecognized. There is little systematic evidence to indicate which anticonvulsant drugs have adverse effects on behavior, but several studies have indicated improvements in behavior associated with carbamazepine and sulthiame.",

      "abstract": "Functional neurologic disorder (FND) is a neuropsychiatric condition that causes psychosomatic symptoms-commonly pain, paralysis, and seizure-like activity. Because presentation can be relatively heterogeneous with symptoms that overlap with other life-threatening or disabling neurologic disorders, FND is often misdiagnosed and incorrectly managed. This results in inappropriate resource utilization and patient care, including but not limited to unnecessary hospital admissions, procedures, imaging resource use, and radiation exposure. Effective treatment of FND often includes a combination of psychotherapy and medication. This is the case of a 28-year-old male who was transferred to a regional level 1 trauma center with concern for acute traumatic spinal cord injury after a fall. Following a negative evaluation for traumatic spinal cord injury and other red flag diagnoses, the patient was diagnosed with FND. The patient's symptomatology was refractory to treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and benzodiazepines. The patient was administered intravenous subdissociative dose ketamine, after which rapid symptom resolution and discharge were achieved. Subdissociative dose ketamine may be a safe, effective, and efficient therapy for FND exacerbations in the emergency department. The patient factors that mediate the clinical outcome require further exploration.",

When it does develop after their use, it appears to be more common after neo-arsphenamin than after arsphenamin. A mild degree of nerve irritation is not rare after the administration of a series of doses of neo-arsphenamin, resulting in the development of numbness and formication in the extremities. The reason that these symptoms appear more frequently after neo-arsphenamin than after arsphenamin in all probability is that the former is a less stable preparation, varies more in the different laboratories in which it is made, and is much more readily subject to oxidation on shaking or exposure to the air. Arsenoxid is more readily formed as a result of this tendency. A further oxidation might lead to a splitting off of the",

      "title": "Biological treatment of Acute Agitation Or Aggression with Schizophrenia Or Bipolar Disorder in the Inpatient Setting",
      "abstract": "Background Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are chronic illnesses that commonly present with symptoms of acute agitation and aggression. These symptoms must be managed rapidly to prevent potential harm to the patient and others, including their caregivers, peers, and health care workers. A number of treatment options are available to clinicians to manage acute agitation and aggression, including non-pharmacologic behavioral and environmental de-escalation strategies, as well as biological treatment options such as pharmacologic agents and electroconvulsive therapy. We summarize the available biological treatment options for patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder presenting with acute agitation or aggression in the inpatient setting, focusing on antipsychotics. Methods The following searches were used in PubMed to obtain the most relevant advances in treating schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with acute agitation and aggression: (agitation, agitated, aggression, aggressive, hostile, hostility, violent, or violence) and (schizophr*, psychosis, psychot*, psychos*, mania, manic, or bipolar) and (*pharmacologic, antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*, antiepileptic*, anti-seizure*, mood stabilizer*, lithium, benzodiazepine*, beta blocker, beta-blocker, alpha2, alpha-2, *histamine*, electroconvulsive, ECT, shock, or transcranial). Individual searches were performed for each drug class. The studies were limited to peer-reviewed, English-language, and human studies. Most were placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or meta-analyses. Results Among pharmacologic agents, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and lithium have been studied in randomized trials. Some typical and, more recently, atypical antipsychotics are available as both oral and short-acting intramuscular (IM) formulations, with 1 typical antipsychotic also available as an inhalable formulation. Conclusions Among the pharmacologic agents studied in RCTs, atypical antipsychotics have the best evidence to support efficacy both in oral and short-acting IM formulations, as well as in one instance in an inhalable formulation.",

Its main advantages over \"typical\" neuroleptics are low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects and its capacity to induce therapeutic response in previously treated refractory patients. However, withdrawal from clozapine has been observed to lead to \"atypical\" clinical characteristics or a \"rebound phenomenon,\" manifested in two interwoven clinical forms: (1) psychotic exacerbation, and (2) cholinergic rebound. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism of this phenomenon is postulated to be a result of cholinergic supersensitivity. In this paper, the \"rebound phenomenon\" will be discussed and exemplified by three case histories in which abrupt cessation of clozapine led to serious deterioration and psychotic exacerbation, and one case in which gradual titration from the drug was employed in order to preempt this hazardous occurrence.",

However, neurotoxicity is a rare side effect of this drug. When present, the symptoms range from confusion, agitation, and delirium in mild cases to mutism, visual blurring, hallucinations, seizures, stupor, and even coma in extreme cases. Within this spectrum, extrapyramidal symptoms are extremely rare, and when present, may not revert with drug discontinuation. Sequelae may occasionally persist even after discontinuation of the drug. Our case illustrates a rare occurrence of ifosfamide-induced extrapyramidal neurotoxicity in a patient with metastatic phyllodes tumor of the breast and concomitant COVID-19 illness. Ifosfamide-induced extrapyramidal neurotoxicity is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion and requires ruling out of other possible causes. The diagnosis is supported by a temporal correlation with drug administration, presence of risk factors, and improvement after infusion cessation, along with normal brain imaging.",

Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

      "title": "Delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism with leukoencephalopathy associated with carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

      "abstract": "Brain-injured patients involved in rehabilitation programs are susceptible to the occurrence of acute seizures or severe behavioral episodes. Effective pharmacological management in this setting should ideally include rapid onset without severe adverse effects. Previous treatments have generally included intramuscular diazepam or lorazepam, as well as intramuscular anti-psychotic drugs. These options have proved problematic due to poor absorption, slow onset of activity, or potential for unacceptable side effects. We report 10 cases involving the use of intramuscular midazolam, a rapid-acting, short half-life benzodiazepine, in treating acute seizures or behavioral problems. We conclude that this drug demonstrates great promise for the rapid, effective treatment of these conditions without significant adverse effects and deserves further study in these areas.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Withdrawal-emergent adverse effects of antipsychotics are an infrequently identified condition which can appear during antipsychotic dose reduction and medication change. In this paper, we present the case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms after a dose reduction of risperidone is presented. A patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to a health care facility due to an unexpected change in his behavior, with paranoid delusions, incoherent thinking, and significant anxiety. An initial risperidone treatment was soon changed to zuclopenhixol. Subsequently, severe extrapyramidal symptoms appeared, after which the medication was switched back to resperidone. Following this treatment, the patient left the health care facility and stopped the medication of his own volition. Psychotic symptoms and massive extrapyramidal symptoms again occurred. These symptoms subsided only slowly during a subsequent treatment with olanzapine. The development of adverse neurological effects together with a worsening of productive psychotic symptomatology may be explained by withdrawal of antipsychotic medication. These symptoms are often attributed to new medications, which are prematurely discontinued after the appearance of an adverse effect, but which are potentially beneficial to a patient, provided that enough time for a spontaneous subsidence of withdrawal-emergent effects is given. Any change in antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered and thoroughly planned.",

      "abstract": "α-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone (α-PVP), also known as “Flakka,” is a synthetic cathinone drug that is being sold on the illicit drug market as a substitute for cocaine, methamphetamine, and MDPV. It is particularly popular in underdeveloped communities. The drug is often consumed in powder, crystalline, tablet, or capsule form. It is important to note that commercial products containing α-PVP are labeled as “not for human consumption” or “for research use only.” When ingested, α-PVP increases the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to feelings of euphoria, alertness, and well-being. However, it also comes with a range of negative side effects, including increased heart rate, mania, high blood pressure, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, kidney failure, and agitation. In severe cases, it can even cause delusions, epilepsy, and violent behavior, potentially resulting in suicide or homicide. In conclusion, according to the serious health and safety risks associated with α-PVP, it is crucial for comprehensive research to be conducted, particularly in Middle Eastern countries. Targeted prevention efforts and effective legislation are also necessary to address the harm caused by this dangerous substance. By understanding the various aspects of α-PVP, health-care professionals, law enforcement agencies, and policymakers can work together to mitigate its impact on individuals and communities and create a safer environment.",

The association of hypnic headache with rapid-eye movement sleep was strongly contradicted in recent articles, while an association with hypothalamic dysfunction is thought to be one important pathophysiological mechanism. Common acute, as well as prophylactic, treatment is caffeine intake, either in the form of a cup of coffee or a caffeine tablet.

Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic, piperazinoazepine compound and is a noradrenergic, adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and muscarinic-antagonist antidepressant that is used for the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric illnesses. There are several reported cases of manic/hypomanic episodes induced by mirtazapine withdrawal based on suspected clinical symptoms that were not confirmed by autopsy and toxicology. We present the first reported case of mirtazapine withdrawal-induced mania/hypomania associated with sudden death and confirmed by autopsy and toxicology. Our patient was a 26-year-old male who had been diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder, borderline intellectual functioning, polysubstance abuse, mild mental retardation, and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. He took only mirtazapine in the final and terminal weeks of his life and stopped taking mirtazapine 4 days before his death. He exhibited a sudden manic/hypomanic episode and died during a physical altercation during this episode. A full autopsy with comprehensive toxicologic analysis of his body fluids and tissues was performed. Autopsy revealed that he died from blunt force trauma of the head, neck, and trunk with extremely low and markedly subtherapeutic levels of mirtazapine and desmethylmirtazapine in the blood (mirtazapine: 0.005 mg/L; desmethylmirtazapine 0.011 mg/L). Advanced selective radioligand and neurochemical assays for density and affinity-binding parameters of dopamine transporter and heat shock protein 70 did not reveal any evidence of excited delirium or autonomic hyperactivity state. We recommend that toxicologic analysis of blood for antidepressants should become routine parts of autopsy protocols for the investigation of sudden death following terminal manic/hypomanic episodes for further elucidation of mania/hypomania induced by antidepressant withdrawal.",

In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Recently, these drugs have also been used for the management of other esophageal disorders, such as non‐erosive reflux disease, the hypersensitive esophagus, and heartburn that is not responsive to proton pump inhibitor treatment. Several etiologies have been identified in patients with functional esophageal disorders, and these include esophageal hypersensitivity due to peripheral and/or central sensitisation, altered central processing of peripheral stimuli, altered autonomic activity, and psychological comorbidity such as depression and anxiety. Different antidepressants have been used as pain modulators and have demonstrated a beneficial effect on patients with the aforementioned esophageal disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants are the most commonly used class of drugs in clinical practice. Other antidepressants that have been used, some with more clinical success than others, include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and trazodone. Other medications that have been used as pain modulators in esophageal disorders include adenosine antagonists, serotonin agonists, antiepileptics, and medications that ameliorate peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism by which many of the pain modulators confer their visceral analgesic effect remains to be fully elucidated. Regardless, their role and value in treating esophageal disorders have markedly increased in the last decade.",

      "title": "Nephrotoxic Effects of Common and Emerging Drugs of Abuse",
      "abstract": "The kidneys can be injured in diverse ways by many drugs, both legal and illegal. Novel associations and descriptions of nephrotoxic effects of common and emerging drugs of abuse have appeared over the past several years. Anabolic androgenic steroids, illicitly used by athletes and others for decades to increase muscle mass and decrease body fat, are emerging as podocyte toxins given recent descriptions of severe forms of FSGS in long-term abusers. Synthetic cannabinoids, a new group of compounds with marijuana-like effects, recently became popular as recreational drugs and have been associated with an atypical form of AKI. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy, is a widely used synthetic recreational drug with mood-enhancing properties and a constellation of toxicities that can result in death. These toxic effects include hyperthermia, hypotonic hyponatremia due to its arginine vasopressin secretagogue-like effects, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular collapse. Cocaine, a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that serves as an illegal stimulant, appetite suppressant, and anesthetic, also causes vasoconstriction and rhabdomyolysis. Recent adulteration of much of the world's supply of cocaine with levamisole, an antihelminthic agent with attributes similar to but distinct from those of cocaine, appears to have spawned a new type of ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis. This review discusses the nephrotoxic effects of these common and emerging drugs of abuse, of which both community and health care providers should become aware given their widespread abuse. Future investigation into pathogenetic mechanisms associated with these drugs is critical and may provide a window into ways to lessen and even prevent the nephrotoxic effects of these drugs of abuse and perhaps allow a deeper understanding of the nephrotoxicities themselves.",

      "title": "Psychedelic and Entactogenic Drugs in the Treatment of Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract CNS deficiency of 5-hydroxytryplamine (serotonin) has been implicated as a biochemical basis in some forms of depression. Existing drug modalities for treating depression include some with serotonergic effects. Studies suggest that psychedelic drugs are also serotonergic, This may indicate a role for psychedelics in the treatment of depression. Such treatment has already been attempted using psychedelic drugs in both the indoleamine and phenylalkylamine categories. Encouraging results seem to recommend further research, with special emphasis on drugs in the phenylisopropylamine subgroup of phenylalkylamines that are only peripherally psychedelic. Certain of these, called entactogens or empathogens, cause substantially less distortion of normative consciousness than classic psychedelics, such as LSD or mescaline. They could therefore be more easily assimilated into existing psychotherapy approaches, where their function would be to enhance the normal psychotherapeutic process rather than serving a maintenance role as chemoth erapeutic agents. Their usefulness in such an application would be mainly at the start of psychotherapy in order to (1) reduce the client's \"fear response\" that often inhibits ability to deal with repressed traumatic material; (2) facilitate the client's interpersonal communications with the therapist, spouse or significant others; and (3) accelerate formation of a therapeutic alliance between client and therapist.

      "title": "Clozapine Initiation for Schizophrenia: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Clozapine is a second generation antipsychotic indicated for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). TRS is schizophrenia that does not respond fully to conventional schizophrenia treatments, including first-line antipsychotics. According to the Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines (CSG), treatment-resistance is indicated after failure of two antipsychotics, although definitions of TRS vary among clinical trials. It has been estimated that in patients receiving conventional pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia, 50% of these patients do not respond adequately to prescribed pharmacotherapy (30% may exhibit a partial response, and 20% may exhibit no response).Clozapine is associated with a variety of side-effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, tachycardia (high resting heart rate), constipation, weight gain, lowered white blood cell count, and excess saliva production. Serious side effects include myocarditis, pericarditis, neutropenia, cardiomyopathy, and death. Some side effects, such as myocarditis, can occur relatively quickly (within two weeks) after initiation of the medication.Clozapine must be initiated at a low dose and titrated up to the therapeutic dose over time to avoid side effects. Therapeutic doses can range from 200 mg to 450 mg per day and are generally not exceeding 900 mg per day (although doses of more than 900 mg per day are possible).– Initiation of clozapine may start as low as 12.5 mg per day, titrating upwards until individual effectiveness is seen (for example, resolution of psychosis symptoms).,Initiation on clozapine requires strict monitoring protocols to ensure compliance and to address the side effects associated with the medication. For example, in the United States, the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy requires all prescribers and pharmacies to be certified in order to prescribe or dispense clozapine. Part of the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program includes regular absolute neutrophil counts for patients on clozapine to monitor for neutropenia. In Canada, after reintroduction of clozapine in 1991 (after removal from the market in 1975 because of reported infections due to low white blood cell counts), patients were required to join a patient registry program (e.g., Sandoz Clozapine Risk Management Program1) to monitor white blood cell counts. When switching to a new brand of clozapine, patients must join the manufacturer-specific registry upon changing medications.Guidelines outlining appropriate use of clozapine are important to ensure timely, safe, and suitable prescribing of clozapine in a variety of settings. The objective of the current review is to summarize clinical effectiveness of clozapine during the initiation phase of treatment in adult patients with schizophrenia and summarize recommendations regarding monitoring of adult patients during this initiation phase.",

These patients were divided in four groups each containing 25 people who were taking neuroleptics or atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, risperidone or aripiprazole).The variability of quantitative sleep disorder was measured using questions 4-5-6 of Hamilton Depression Scale to evaluate early, intermediate or late insomnia, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to assess EDS (excessive daytime sleepiness)We all know the sedative effects of neuroleptics, furtherless it is not unexpected that most of the atypical antipsychotics are sedating, and thus have the potential to impair judgement, thinking or motor skills giving the patients the sensation of being different from the other people. Many times we forget that the other side of insomnia is the excessive daytime sleepiness….In the future, we have to manage these disorders, if we want to avoid lack of compliance and further drop out of therapy.",

      "title": "Ketamine for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness, and Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "In Canada, about one in five adults older than 18 years of age live with chronic pain. Pain can be sub-defined by three main biological mechanisms: 1) Nociceptive pain (from damage to body tissue, as in injury, disease or inflammation); 2) Neuropathic pain (from direct damage of the nervous system); and 3) Nociplastic pain (from a change in sensory neurons function). Chronic pain is associated with significant emotional distress, like anxiety, anger, frustration and depression, and is recognized by the World Health Organization as a disease by itself listed in the International Classification of Disease version 11. Treatment and management of chronic pain are complex and difficult, involving multiple interventions, including pharmacological and psychological interventions. Pharmacological interventions considered for chronic pain include nonopioid analgesics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen), antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, other adjuvant medications (e.g., topical agents, cannabis and cannabinoids), opioid, and infusion therapies (e.g., ketamine, lidocaine).Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been approved and primarily used as an anesthetic induction agent in doses ranging between 1 and 4.5 mg/kg. As it also interacts with other receptors, ketamine has been explored for other indications such as depressive disorders, suicidal ideation, substance-use disorders, anxiety disorders, refractory status epilepticus, bronchial asthma exacerbations, and pain management. In hospital and emergency department, ketamine has been used for pain management of acute conditions such as burns, trauma, or post-operative pain. Recently, intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions has been increasingly used as a treatment option for acute pain as well as chronic non-cancer pain such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), neuropathic pain, and other refractory chronic pain conditions. Despite potential opportunities of ketamine for numerous indications, the use of ketamine is known to be associated with psychotomimetic effects such as euphoria, dysphoria, psychomotor retardation, hallucinations, vivid dreams, and nightmares, as common side effects. Given the availability of ketamine of different formulations and its potential opportunities in pain management, there is a need to determine its benefits and risks in the treatment of chronic pain.The aim of this report is to review the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ketamine for treating chronic non-cancer pain in adults. This report also aims to review the evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of ketamine for chronic non-cancer pain.",

The pains are often described as \"shooting\" or \"radiating\" in nature. There can also be a minor component of constant achy pains in the trigeminal distribution. Spontaneous remissions are common. The definition of trigeminal neuralgia as any idiopathic spontaneous facial pain, subcategorized as TN1 if such pain is predominantly episodic and TN2 if it is predominantly constant, is not advisable. Such a broad definition will, necessarily, include many patients who clearly do not have true trigeminal neuralgia and will not likely benefit from the standard trigeminal neuralgia procedures (microvascular decompression/MVD or trigeminal denervation).",

      "abstract": "The concept of analgo-sedation in intensive care medicine has changed considerably since the last decades. Deep sedation, keeping patients artificially unconscious, is not necessary anymore, it postpones weaning from mechanical ventilation, it provokes complications, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. On the other hand, recent surveys have shown that patients recall their intensive care experience still as stressing and painful. This need more awareness of patient's pain and the readiness to give analgesics particularly before painful procedures. The frightening environment of the ICU, sleep deprivation, pain and discomfort related not only to the actual dysfunctions, but even more to the stressing procedures of care and treatment, make a certain level of sedation necessary. But patients' discomfort may also originate from many other reasons, such as hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac failure, drugs overdose or withdrawal, or simply from an uncomfortable body position. These sometimes non-obvious reasons have to be carefully looked for in order to treat the problem effectively. Delirium and other mental problems are common in critically ill patients. They have to be diagnosed with particular attention and treated specifically. Sedatives must be carefully adapted to the individual needs and the actual situation. Modern modes of mechanical ventilation allows lower levels of sedation. Regularly repeated assessment of the sedation level (e.g. by Ramsay score) is mandatory; a sedation protocol seems advantageous. To avoid inadvertent accumulation and overdose, it is recommended to keep the patient at a sedation level at which communication is still possible. A daily interruption of the sedation has shown to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay.",

Randomized trials have documented significant analgesic effects for managing chronic pain associated with fibromyalgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Studies have also suggested that pain associated with major depressive disorder can be reduced with this medication. Modest effects for headache, osteoarthritic pain, and pain secondary to Parkinson disease have also been documented, but data are obtained from single-blinded or open-label trials that require further corroboration with larger randomized studies.

      "title": "Subjective Well-being and Initial Dysphoric Reaction under Antipsychotic Drugs - Concepts, Measurement and Clinical Relevance",
      "abstract": "Since the introduction of neuroleptics in 1952, many studies have examined objective aspects of efficacy and tolerability. Despite the fact that neuroleptic treatment should also improve the patient's subjective experiences, this outcome criterion has been neglected in the past. This is unfortunate, as subjective well-being with treatment appears to be strongly related to patients' readiness to take their medication. The few existing studies differ in methodology and are difficult to compare due to a number of weaknesses, including varying underlying concepts, used assessment scales, or small sample sizes. Negative subjective well-being may manifest itself throughout the entire neuroleptic treatment, even as early as in the first 48 hours after neuroleptic treatment starts (initial dysphoric reaction, IDR). The aetiology of reduced subjective well-being or IDR is not fully explained; neuroleptic side effects, especially affective, cognitive and motor adverse events, differential effects of varying psychopathology or biopsychosocial are factors in discussion. The clinical impression is characterised by symptoms as dysphoria/anhedonia, reduced vitality, and emotional indifference, which could have a negative impact on relevant clinical factors such as response or medication adherence, and therefore on outcome. With regard to pharmacological treatment, evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotics induce less negative subjective effects than conventional neuroleptics, and that various new-generation antipsychotics could be evaluated differently by patients. This article reviews existing literature in order to approach relevant questions for pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of ischemic tolerance perfectly describes this quote \"What does not kill you makes you stronger.\" Ischemic pre- or postconditioning is actually the strongest known procedure to prevent or reverse neurodegeneration. It works specifically in sensitive vulnerable neuronal populations, which are represented by pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. However, tolerance is effective in other brain cell populations as well. Although, its nomenclature is \"ischemic\" tolerance, the tolerant phenotype can also be induced by other stimuli that lead to delayed neuronal death (intoxication). Moreover, the recent data have proven that this phenomenon is not limited to application of sublethal stimuli before the lethal stress but reversed arrangement of events, sublethal stress after lethal insult, is rather equally effective. A very important term is called \"cross conditioning.\" Cross conditioning is the capability of one stressor to induce tolerance against another. So, since pre- or post-conditioners can be used plenty of harmful stimuli, hypo- or hyperthermia and some physiological compounds, such as norepinephrine, bradykinin. Delayed neuronal death is the slow development of postischemic neurodegeneration. This allows an opportunity for a great therapeutic window of 2-3 days to reverse the cellular death process. Moreover, it seems that the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance-delayed postconditioning could be used not only after ischemia but also in some other processes leading to apoptosis.",

It can produce a parkinsonian-like bradykinesia and mild akathisia, but no rigidity and rarely tremor. In patients with tardive dyskinesia induced by other neuroleptics, clozapine permits the dyskinesia to disappear in about half the cases. That clozapine may induce tardive dyskinesia in extremely rare cases cannot be excluded, but it seems more likely that this tardive dyskinesia in clozapine-treated patients is due to previous treatment with classical neuroleptics. The earlier clozapine is started, the less chance for development of tardive dyskinesia. As do other neuroleptics, clozapine can elicit sedation and asthenia, but corresponding to the motoric extrapyramidal syndrome, clozapine causes emotional indifference (\"mental parkinsonism\"), depression, and restlessness to a significantly lesser degree, which may be of importance in the higher compliance seen with this drug.",

Previously, he received a wide range of antipsychotic drug treatment regimens at other psychiatric facilities, all with some degree of effect, but never with complete symptom relief. At the time of admission to our inpatient clinic, he was started on cariprazine and reported a significant decrease in visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations with complete cessation for a period of two weeks.

He had been taking quinidine since 1974 for a recurring supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. Examination revealed a suspicious man with widespread patchy cognitive deficits but no focal neurological signs. An exhaustive range of investigations gave unremarkable results. Within 24 hours of cessation of quinidine there was a dramatic improvement in his mental state and, after a further four days, he had returned essentially to normal with no demonstrable cognitive deficits. Several months later he suffered a recrudescence with prominent paranoid and depressive features which gradually settled after commencement of pimozide and dothiepin. It is likely that these events reflect a recurring functional psychosis which was precipitated or exacerbated in the first instance by quinidine. This represents a significant complication of quinidine therapy which has been largely unrecognized. Therapy with quinidine should be considered as a potential contributing factor in any patient with dementia or a functional psychosis who is also taking this drug.",

This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

A third criterion has been used, including several minor symptoms [fatigue, sleep disorders, stiff ness …] and probable FMS has been defined by two criteria out of three. These different definitions suggest that FMS is more than one disorder and that other criteria are probably needed.Conclusions: Our definition of probable or “in complete” FMS is based on the presence of spontaneous, wide spread, persistent pain, fatigue, and peripheral symptoms such as stiffness, of ten modulated by weather changes, stress, and exercise.Our definition of mechanical allodynia is based on pressure induced tendino-muscular pain [tenderness] usually associated with central symptoms such as sleep disorders [TePs syndrome].Fibromyalgia might then be defined by the association of two distinct conditions: incomplete FMS [spontaneous, diffuse pain, and fatigue], and tenderness [mechanical allodynia], both having been aggravated by physical deconditioning.",

      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant sensory perception warning of actual or impending tissue damage. Pain serves a vital physiological role, however, severe and uncontrolled pain in the peri-operative setting can adversely affect outcome from surgery and lead to chronic pain. Multiple neurochemical and receptor processes are involved in pain perception but the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adrenergic pathways has only recently been recognised. Clonidine is an agonist at the alpha2-adrenergic receptor that has been in clinical use for over 40 years. Clonidine was recognised at an early stage as having analgesic properties however its systemic use was frequently limited by side-effects. Recent advances in anaesthetic practice, allowing more targeted drug delivery and a better understanding of the basic physiology of pain have led to a re-evaluation of the role of clonidine in pain management. Experimental and clinical studies have identified a diverse action of clonidine in modifying not only the adrenergic component to pain perception but also an important effect on modifying the neurohumoral response to tissue injury. This has implications for the management of a diverse range of pain problems and potentially offers a method of preventing the transition from acute to chronic pain. Clonidine is likely to play an increasing role in clinical practice in anaesthetics and pain management.

Within 24 hours of initiation of the methylprednisolone, the patient developed symptoms associated with steroid-induced psychosis including mania, head-banging, and excessive crying. Because the corticosteroid could not be discontinued, promethazine, a phenothiazine derivative, was used to treat the psychotic symptoms. Symptoms resolved with use of promethazine.A number of published reports describe the appearance of psychological symptoms with corticosteroid use. While the mechanism is unclear, the reaction is usually reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation of the corticosteroid. In cases where this cannot be done, typical treatment involves an antipsychotic medication. Most antipsychotic medications, such as the phenothiazine class, have not been evaluated in very young children. Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative that has been used in children for a number of nonpsychiatric indications.Promethazine may be effective in treating steroid-induced psychosis in pediatric patients.",

Systemic administration of many of these convulsant agents, such as pentylenetetrazol and bicuculline, results in generalized electrographic seizures that appear to begin in a wide variety of brain structures simultaneously. Other convulsant drugs induce focal-onset seizures in the limbic system, such as pilocarpine, or in the spinal cord, such as strychnine. The convulsant-induced seizure types include seizures with a focal onset in structures of the limbic system and seizures with a generalized onset that begin simultaneously in widely distributed brain regions, with no evidence of focal onset. The generalized-onset type will be subdivided into \"spontaneous\" convulsant-induced generalized-onset seizures, which are those that occur in the absence of intentional stimulation. The Substantia Nigra has received considerable attention with respect to modulation of seizures induced by electroshock and kindling, but the role of this structure in seizures induced by convulsant drugs is more controversial.",

      "title": "Vertigo",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

Estima-se que apenas 25% dos pacientes com dor neuropatica apresentam um alivio superior a 50% com o uso dos farmacos disponiveis. O nicorandil e um farmaco usado em alguns paises no tratamento de pacientes com angina pectoris e tem a capacidade de liberar NO e promover a abertura de canais para K+ ATP-dependentes. Estudos recentes demonstraram a atividade do nicorandil em modelos de dores inflamatoria e nociceptiva, o que justifica a avaliacao deste farmaco em modelos de dor neuropatica. Assim, os efeitos induzidos pelo nicorandil (50, 100 ou 150 mg/kg, p.o.) foram avaliados nos modelos de dor neuropatica induzida por paclitaxel (2 mg/kg, 2 mL/kg, i.p.) ou por constricao do nervo isquiatico em camundongos Swiss machos (25-30 g). O nicorandil inibiu a alodinia mecânica quando administrado uma ou duas vezes no setimo e no decimo quarto dia apos a primeira injecao de paclitaxel, sendo que os resultados mais significativos foram observados quando este farmaco foi administrado duas vezes, em um intervalo de duas horas. Doses equimolares de acido nicotinico ou nicotinamida nao induziram efeito antinociceptivo. Quando o efeito induzido pelo nicorandil foi avaliado apos administracoes repetidas (100 ou 150 mg/kg, 2 vezes, p.o.), a atividade antinociceptiva se manteve apos duas administracoes adicionais, no 15° e no 16° dia. O nicorandil tambem apresentou atividade antinociceptiva no modelo de dor neuropatica induzida por constricao do nervo isquiatico. A atividade antinociceptiva do nicorandil nao foi associada ao comprometimento da atividade motora avaliada na haste girante (14 rpm, 2 min). A administracao previa de naltrexona (5 ou 10 mg/Kg, i.p., -15 min), glibenclamida (20 ou 40 mg/kg, p.o., -30 min) ou ciproheptadina (5 ou 10 mg/kg, i.p. -15 min) foi realizada para investigar possiveis mecanismos envolvidos na atividade antinociceptiva do nicorandil no modelo de dor neuropatica induzida por paclitaxel. Os resultados indicam a participacao de receptores opioidergicos e serotoninergicos, mas nao de canais para potassio ATP-dependentes. Concluindo, os resultados demonstram que o nicorandil apresenta atividade nos modelos de dor neuropatica induzida por paclitaxel ou por constricao do nervo isquiatico. Essa atividade nao parece ser mediada pela nicotinamida ou pelo acido nicotinico. Receptores opioidergicos e serotoninergicos possivelmente medeiam a atividade antinociceptiva do nicorandil. Os resultados demonstram que o nicorandil pode representar uma alternativa importante na farmacoterapia de pacientes com dor neuropatica e servem de estimulo a realizacao de ensaios pre-clinicos e clinicos adicionais para investigar o potencial uso desse farmaco como analgesico.",

In older patients (&gt;70) levodopa should be started as soon as symptom relief is required. Between these ages there is no consensus, but at present most such patients should probably be given controlled release levodopa before a dopamine agonist is added Fluctuations can often be alleviated by giving controlled release preparations of levodopa, by giving small doses at frequent intervals, by adding selegiline or a long acting oral agonist, or by subcutaneous apomorphine Dyskinesia can be peak dose, diphasic, or \"off period.\" The diphasic form is hardest to alleviate Psychiatric side effects should initially be managed by changing the antiparkinsonian treatment before resorting to antipsychotic drugs",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychedelics are compounds acting by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A receptor activation and induce several behavioral responses. They are of special interest because of their positive effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder). However, several findings revealed that some psychedelic actions are similar to symptoms observed in schizophrenia (psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, attention, and working memory deficits) which might limit their clinical applications. Psychedelics activate some neurotransmitters, i.e., serotonergic, and glutamatergic, that are also impaired in schizophrenia. Therefore, the neurobiological background of psychedelics and schizophrenia is partially similar. Another important aspect to discuss is the perspective of using psychedelics in schizophrenia therapy. Postmortem studies showed a loss of synapses in schizophrenia, and the positive effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity (synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis) might be essential in the context of schizophrenia therapy. However, because of psychedelics' psychotic action, the recommended doses of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment are not established, and subpsychedelic dosing or microdosing are considered. Exploratory studies are needed to determine the tolerability of treatment and appropriate dosing regimen. Another therapeutic option is using non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs that also induce neuroplastic outcomes but do not have psychotogenic effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to recognize the potential effectiveness of 5-HT 2A agonists in schizophrenia therapy.",

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue.

      "abstract": "Antiepileptic drug selection is based on efficacy for specific seizure types and epileptic syndromes. For idiopathic generalized epilepsies with absence, tonic-clonic, and myoclonic seizures, the drug of choice is valproate. Secondary generalized epilepsies with tonic, atonic, and other seizure types are difficult to treat with any single drug or combination of drugs. The drugs of choice for absence seizures are ethosuximide and valproate. For control of tonic-clonic seizures, any of the other major antiepileptic drugs can be effective. If valproate cannot be used, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone is effective, but ethosuximide or a benzodiazepine needs to be added to control associated absence or myoclonic seizures. The drugs of first choice for partial epilepsies with partial and secondarily tonic-clonic seizures are carbamazepine and phenytoin. Increasing evidence suggests that valproate may be a third alternative. Phenobarbital and primidone are second choice selections because of side effects. A combination of two of these five major antiepileptic drugs may be necessary for inadequately controlled patients. Other epilepsy syndromes such as neonatal and infantile epilepsies, febrile epilepsy, and alcoholic epilepsy require specific drug treatment. For all these seizure types and epilepsy syndromes, treatment ultimately must be selected to provide maximal efficacy and minimal adverse effect for each individual patient.",

The drug treatment algorithms for status epilepticus generally go through three stages, starting with benzodiazepines: lorazepam, midazolam, or diazepam as first line drugs, moving to levetiracetam, valproate or fos-phenytoin as second-line drugs, ending, if necessary, with anesthetics like propofol or midazolam. Lacosamide, topiramate, phenobarbital, brivaracetam, and perampanel are potential alternatives, and pentobarbital is commonly used when long-term anesthesia is needed. Super refractory status epilepticus is the form that usually causes the most concern. Treatment guidelines for newer treatment alternatives are often based only on case reports and small patient series. Such alternatives include ketamine, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, inhalation anesthetics and hypothermia, and several surgical neurostimulation procedures. This chapter provides an overview of current treatment alternatives, with particular focus on refractory status epilepticus and super-refractory status epilepticus.",

      "abstract": "Used appropriately, sedative–hypnotics improve the quality of life for the vast majority of patients who take them. Adverse consequences of their use may include unrecognized memory impairment, physiological dependence, and substance disorders of abuse or dependence. In the elderly, sedative–hypnotics may increase the risk of falls and confusion. Short-acting barbiturates and the older sedative–hypnotics can be lethal if taken in overdose. Benzodiazepines and the newer nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have a greater margin of safety profile with regard to overdose. The benzodiazepines and newer hypnotics are commonly used by drug abusers, but are rarely used as primary intoxicants. Abuse and dependence and physiological dependence may occur. This chapter focuses on abuse potential, diagnosis of dependence and treatment of benzodiazepine and other sedative–hypnotic drug dependence. Newer nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics—zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone, and zopiclone—are covered in detail because they are now the most commonly prescribed hypnotics, and the manifestations of abuse and dependence and the pharmacotherapy of dependence are less well known. Emphasis is placed on the more recent literature and reviews. Management of physiological dependence is covered in detail. The clinical and biological rationale for using phenobarbital for treatment of physical dependence on sedative–hypnotics is developed, and phenobarbital withdrawal conversions are provided for common benzodiazepines and other sedative–hypnotics. Common issues that arise during evaluation and treatment of sedative–hypnotic dependence are illustrated with case vignettes.",

Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes. PALABRAS CLAVES. Cefalea. Medicamentos, Cefalea de tipo tensional, Trastornos migranosos, Cefaleas secundarias. (Martha R. Alvarez S, Ronald G. Garcia G, Federico Arturo Silva S. Cefalea por uso excesivo de medicamentos: implicaciones clinicas y terapeuticas . Acta Neurol Colomb 2010;26:195-201). SUMMARY The medication overuse headache (MOH) is define as daily or almost daily headache (15 days or more) in patients with history of primary headache who takes excessive medications. This pathology is associated with psychiatric conditions, reason why with the time the clinical characteristics become more complex. The basic treatment is stopping the medication (analgesic, ergotamine, triptans or opioids), but this could bring us another problem called “rebound headache”, withdrawal sindrome or epileptic convulsions. These symptoms could increase the relapsing rate on this patients.",

      "title": "Drug Dependency",
      "abstract": "The legal and illegal use of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens, is markedly increasing. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may cause severe acute or chronic symptoms; one cannot predict adverse reactions or relate them to frequency and length of LSD use. Among its effects are acute psychologic changes, including psychosis; and chronic alterations, such as apathy, psychosis, and \"flashback.\" Chlorpromazine is recommended for treatment of symptoms; psychotherapy and education help prevent further LSD use. Chronic amphetamine use may lead to toxic psychosis, confusion, or brain damage; acute withdrawal may lead to depression, with suicidal ideation, and increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with nightmares and insomnia. Chronic use of barbiturates and nonbarbiturate hypnotics may lead to mental impairment, motor incoordination, and depression. Withdrawal produces weakness, irritability, and occasionally convulsions or psychosis. Amphetamines and hypnotics should be withdrawn gradually and patients educated as to possible physiologic alterations, both those patients dependent on large doses and those who have taken therapeutic doses for some months. Withdrawal of these drugs leads to marked increases in REM sleep, nightmares, and insomnia, which may lead to drug dependency. Marijuana may change time sense and visual and auditory perceptions. Chronic use frequently indicates underlying psychologic disturbances needing psychotherapy. Psychoactive drugs differentially affect responses of various autonomic systems. Central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs do not induce only one condition and cannot be simply classified as excitants or depressants. The physiologic alterations produced by psychoactive drugs are basic to drug dependency as are personality factors.",

Although uncommon, it results in significant disability. Most cases occur sporadically, but genetic factors probably form a susceptibility background on which unknown environmental triggers act. The hypocretin system is strongly implicated in the development of narcolepsy. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of hypocretin-1 are significantly reduced in narcoleptic subjects with cataplexy. Despite the advances in our understanding of narcolepsy, current therapy is primarily symptomatic. Stimulants (standard and novel) combat excessive daytime sleepiness. Antidepressants (tricyclics, dual-action or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) and sodium oxybate are anticataplexy agents. Hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis respond to antidepressants. Sodium oxybate consolidates sleep. Novel and experimental treatments include histamine antagonists, hypocretin agonists, slow-wave sleep enhancers, intravenous γ-globulin, tramadol and corticosteroids.",

      "title": "Muscle relaxants in the anesthetic practice - clinical risks",
      "abstract": "Muscle relaxants are neuromuscular blockers that cause relaxation of the skeletal muscles. They represent nitrogen compounds with an affinity for N-cholinoreceptors. They are used in anesthesiology to induce a prolonged paralysis - a prerequisite for long lasting interventions. The nature of these drugs, improper dosing and clinical indications carry their appropriate health risks. Some muscle relaxants are an analogue of acetylcholine and thus easily bind to ACh receptors but, unlike them, they are not metabolized by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The occurring prolonged depolarization leads to muscle relaxation – hence the name depolarizing muscle relaxants. That includes suxamethonium chloride (succinylcholine), brand name Lysthenon. Application of this medicine is not recommended for patients with pulmonary edema, severe hepatic dysfunction, history of malignant hyperthermia, hyperkalemia and others. It may cause allergic reactions such as bronchospasm. Combination with other drugs suppresses or potentiates its action. In children and adolescents Lysthenon can cause irreversible cardiac arrest so its use is limited to cases in need of an immediate endotracheal intubation. The majority of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants are not metabolized by the ACh-esterase. They bind irreversibly to the cholinergic receptor and produce stoichiometric changes in it. Their metabolusm is not organ-dependent – the so-called Hofmann elimination. Intermediate metabolites may lead to side effects - such as CNS hyperexcitability and seizures (Laudanozin toxicity). Cardiovascular events and allergic reactions have also been observed. Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants include Atracurium (Tracrium), Cisatracurium, Pipecuronium (Arduan), Rocuronium (Esmeron), Pancuronium (Pavulon), Doxacurium, etc. Usually in clinical practice a particular drug becomes universal and is used on many patients despite the existence of minimal clinical risks. Better understanding of muscle relaxants, their properties and side effects promises an optimal and safe use.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Catatonia is a syndrome characterized by physical symptoms ranging from immobility to excessive motor activity. Besides being historically associated mainly with schizophrenia, it is widely known that it can be the expression of different psychiatric, neurological or medical conditions. The treatment of choice is benzodiazepines, indicating electroconvulsive therapy in refractory cases. Amantadine is considered a second-line therapy in setting when electroconvulsive therapy is not available. Objectives To describe the case of a patient with treatment-resistant catatonic schizophrenia. Not having responded to benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy, potentiation with amantadine was subsequently started. Methods Our patient presented at a psychopathological level; psychomotor inhibition, a perplexing attitude, and mute speech. At the motor level; ambitendency, indecision, automatic obedience, motor stereotypes, and facial grimaces. He did not present other alterations at the neurological level. Regarding complementary explorations, we performed neuroimaging and blood tests, which resulted all anodyne. With an alternative diagnosis, we considered that sequelae of a neuroleptic malignant syndrome could have produced the symptoms that he had suffered. Due to the persistence of the symptoms and their typical characteristics, catatonia was our first diagnostical impression. As treatment with benzodiazepines was ineffective, electroconvulsive therapy was started. No clinical improvement was observed. Given the refractoriness of the case, a review of the existing literature was carried out. We found reports of a good response to amantadine in similar cases. Amantadine was introduced up to a dose of 200mg. Results After four weeks of treatment with amantadine at a dose of 200mg, the patient showed meager improvement at both psychopathological and motor level. Conclusions We find the case of a patient with long-term schizophrenia who is nowadays dependent on all daily living activities and requires sustained care. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Abstract Under certain conditions, information may become stressful. In the initial stages of our research we found that informational stress can result in fatigue, anxiety, sleeplessness, and excitability. Later we found further symptoms, such as tachycardia, palpitations, chest pain, abdominal pain, increase or decrease of appetite, diarrhoea or constipation, muscle cramps, back pain, headache, tremor, dizziness, diaphoresis, tics, and so on. Some of these symptoms might be the result of cathecholamine increased secretion, others of a decrease of endogenous opioids. Because in the initial stage of stress analgesia may occur, we studied the clinical and experimental evolution of the pain threshold and its clinical manifestations. We found that after the initial analgesia, there follows a stage of hyperalgesia; the symptoms of this stage very much resemble those of the opioid abstinence syndrome. The evolution of this syndrome is enhanced by naloxone, an opioid antagonist, and it is attenuated by clonidine and propranolol, used in the treatment of opioid abstinence syndrome. Thus we demonstrated that in the latter stage of stress, there is diminished secretion of endogenous opioids and an acute tolerance to them.",

      "abstract": "The clinical spectrum of muscle- and skeletal-related side-effects of statins includes varied myalgias and weakness, an asymptomatic increase in the concentration of creatine kinase and other biochemical parameters, myositis and rhabdomyolysis. Currently, there is no consensus on the definition of 'statin myopathy'. Evidence suggests that deleterious effects may also be associated with the volume or dosage of structured exercise and/or the intensity of physical activity. Moreover, non-muscle adverse effects on the joints and tendons are often overlooked and underemphasized. The incidence of myopathy associated with statin treatment typically ranges between 1.5% and 10%. Few data are available regarding the prevalence of muscle- related symptoms associated with different statins and the distribution of affected muscles. Furthermore, discrepancies between clinical trials and daily practice may emanate, in part, because of inconsistent definitions or exclusion criteria. The pathophysiology of statin-related myopathy is incompletely understood. A dose-dependent and proapoptotic effect, direct effects on mitochondria, drug interactions and genetic factors, or combinations thereof, may be involved. Recently, a rare immune-mediated myopathy triggered by statin use has been described. With the increasing number of patients treated with statins and with more patients being prescribed high doses of potent statins to achieve low-density lipoprotein targets, muscle-related side-effects will become more prevalent. Currently, the only effective treatment is the discontinuation of statin use. Further research is needed to develop alternative LDL-lowering drugs when statins are not well tolerated and to establish additional effective strategies to manage lipids and lipoproteins.",

In addition to pain, the most common symptoms in the terminal stages of an illness such as cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are fatigue, anorexia, cachexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, delirium and dyspnea. Management involves a diagnostic evaluation for the cause of each symptom when possible, treatment of the identified cause when reasonable, and concomitant treatment of the symptom using nonpharmacologic and adjunctive pharmacologic measures. Part I of this two-part article discusses fatigue, anorexia, cachexia, nausea and vomiting. Fatigue is the most common symptom at the end of life, but little is known about its pathophysiology and specific treatment. Education of the patient and family is the foundation of treatment with the possible use of adjunctive psychostimulants. Anorexia and cachexia caused by wasting syndromes are best managed with patient and family education, as well as a possible trial of appetite stimulants such as megestrol or dexamethasone. For appropriate pharmacologic treatment, it is helpful to identify the pathophysiologic origin of nausea in each patient.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

      "abstract": "Drugs acting through 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin or 5-HT) systems modulate memory and its alterations, although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. 5-HT drugs may present promnesic and/or antiamnesic (or even being amnesic) effects. Key questions regarding 5-HT markers include whether receptors directly or indirectly participate and/or contribute to the physiological and pharmacological basis of memory and its pathogenesis; hence, the major aim of this article was to examine recent advances in emergent targets of the 5-HT systems for memory formation and memory alterations. Recent reviews and findings are summarized, mainly in the context of the growing notion of memory deficits in brain disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, mild cognitive impairment, consumption of drugs, poststroke cognitive dysfunctions, schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, and infection-induced memory impairments). Mainly, mammalian and (some) human data were the focus. At least agonists and antagonists for 5-HT1A/1B, 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors as well as serotonin uptake inhibitors seem to have a promnesic and/or antiamnesic effect in different conditions and 5-HT markers seem to be associated to neural changes. Available evidence offers clues about the possibilities, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, 5-HT transporter expression seems to be a reliable neural marker related to memory mechanisms and its alterations.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Tremor is the most common involuntary movement disorder. It can be an isolated symptom or a symptom of another neurological disorder, such as dystonia, Parkinson disease, spinocerebellar ataxia et al. It is an unintentional, somewhat rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements of one or more parts of the body. It can affect the hands, arms, head, vocal cord, jaw, chin, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. Clinically, the most useful way to categorized tremor is whether it occurs mainly at rest, on postural, or during movement (kinetic tremor). Tremor is most common classified by different clinical features and cause or origin; include essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, cerebellar tremor, dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, physiologic tremor, and psychogenic tremor. Diagnosis need a detail history (include familial inheritance, drugs exposure, alcohol consumption or withdraw); complete physical examination and laboratory tests. Electromyography is also a simple and quick method with which to calculate tremor frequency and amplitude for assisting diagnosis. Treatment for majority of tremor syndrome is purely symptomatic, and is similar regardless of the underlying cause of the tremor. There are different medicines to try in order propranolol, clonazepam, primidome and gabapentin for limb tremors, or trihexyphenidyl for dystonic tremor. Focal botulinum toxin injection may be help in focal tremor. Neurosurgery is only indicated in severe tremor, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus for primary or secondary parkinsonian tremor.",

The syndrome had a gradual onset, responded slowly to withdrawal of the neuroleptic or use of an anticholinergic agent, but seemed to respond more rapidly to amantadine. The syndrome may easily be confused with a worsening of schizophrenic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Any decision to prescribe is complex and involves the consideration of numerous factors. Most drugs prescribed in dementia are for symptomatic relief or control rather than disease modification. Some drugs have been found to increase the risk of developing dementia. These include drugs with anti-cholinergic properties. This chapter discusses in detail the use of the four medications that are currently licensed in the UK for the treatment of Alzheimer's Dementia: donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine. It also considers their use in Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Vascular Dementia. These drugs' main role is in slowing the clinical progression of dementia and they are effective in about 50% of people. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia are commonly treated with medication when other methods have been exhausted, although the drugs' side effects and associated risks often outweigh their benefits. The drugs used include antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilisers, the cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Analgesia can also be beneficial when pain is contributing to behavioural symptoms. Recent research into new drugs for dementia has brought very few drugs to market for clinical use but trials are ongoing. Other research methods include investigating medications which may reduce the risk of developing dementia.",

      "abstract": "Side effects remain one of the most important clinical issues in antidepressant therapy. Patients may not be able to take appropriate treatment or may not tolerate their medication in adequate doses or for an adequate length of time to manage their depressive illness. This article reviews the extensive safety data from 6705 patients treated with paroxetine. These data indicate that paroxetine has no significant cardiovascular effects, few significant drug interactions, and no clinically significant effects on the ECG or EEG. Furthermore, paroxetine is relatively safe in overdose and has very little anticholinergic activity. Psychomotor performance is not impaired by paroxetine and there is no evidence of any zimelidine-like hypersensitivity reactions or increase in suicidal ideation. As with other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most common side effect is gastrointestinal upset, especially nausea. This is usually very well tolerated and rarely leads to drug discontinuation. As with other SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not be prescribed concurrently or soon after discontinuing paroxetine because of the risk of a lethal interaction. Paroxetine may be less likely than currently available SSRIs to cause agitation. In general, paroxetine has a very favorable side effect profile and should be an important alternative in the medical treatment of depressive illness.",

ET can cause significant functional disability that makes activities of daily living such as eating, drinking and writing difficult and in some cases nearly impossible. Although ET can occur at any age, it is more common with advancing age. It is estimated that up to five of every 100 persons over 60 years of age are affected (1). Current first-line pharmacological treatment includes primidone and beta adrenergic blockers such as propranolol. Second-line pharmacological therapies include benzodiazepines, gabapentin, and topiramate. In some patients, botulinum toxin injections provide some benefit but outcomes have been inconsistent. In general, pharmacological therapies are effective in only about 50% of ET patients (2). For ET patients with medication-resistant tremor that causes significant disability but who do not have significant cognitive, behavioral/psychiatric, or other medical conditions that preclude surgery, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus is a worthwhile treatment option.",

      "title": "Anticonvulsants: The Psychotropic and Medically Protective Drugs of the Future",
      "abstract": "After more than a century of scientific study and philosophical debate, the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders is still unclear. However, an emerging hypothesis contends that psychiatric and related functional symptoms are rooted in an inherent hyperexcitability of the neurological system. Particularly under the influence of stress, too many neurons fire for too long, resulting in circuit-specific psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, irritability, insomnia, inattention, and obsessional thinking as well as various physical symptoms that have no identifiable organic cause, such as migraine headache, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel, and chronic pain. Based on this hypothesis, anticonvulsant drugs, which could more aptly be called “Neuroregulators” because of their proposed mechanism of action, should have emerged as the drugs of choice for most of these disorders. Yet the use of anticonvulsants, at least for psychiatric disorders, dwindles in comparison to antidepressants, antipsychotics, psychostimulants, and sedative hypnotics. This article addresses the dearth of anticonvulsant drug use and the hypothetical reasons that several other classes of drugs continue to be used ahead of anticonvulsants despite the expanding base of evidence in support of the neuronal hyperexcitability hypothesis. The article will also propose new ways that anticonvulsants could be used to optimize their effectiveness for the wide range of disorders they should be able to treat, and it will discuss the means by which anticonvulsants could, in theory, be used prophylactically to prevent the development of an equally wide range of general medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, dementia, and cancer.",

PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

There is a paucity of literature on the association of lenalidomide with tardive dyskinesia. Common central nervous system-related side effects include peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, dysgeusia, headache, tremor, somnolence, and memory impairment. Very few studies in the existing literature have reported an association of tardive dyskinesia with lenalidomide therapy. Here, we present a case of an elderly female with multiple myeloma who developed severe tardive dyskinesia while she was on lenalidomide maintenance therapy.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the particular pharmacology of different antidepressant drugs can help explain their adverse effects when they are discontinued. For all antidepressant drugs, abruptly stopping them can sometimes result in “rebound” hypomania or mania. Antidepressant drugs having anticholinergic effects often are associated with a discontinuation syndrome characterized by cholinergic rebound, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, sweating, headache, and muscle spasms. Discontinuation of monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs sometimes results in flu-like symptoms, dysphoria, restlessness, tachycardia, hypertension, and a delirium-like state. Serotonergic antidepressant drugs are sometimes associated with a distinct discontinuation syndrome characterized by dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. Adverse discontinuation effects can occur with all types of antidepressant drugs, but only rarely would they be considered serious. To minimize adverse discontinuation effects and to reduce the risk of relapse or recurrence of the underlying treated condition, tapering antidepressant medication is prudent for all patients.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Patients with atypical depression are more likely to respond to monoamine oxidase inhibitors than to tricyclic antidepressants. They are frequently offered psychotherapy in the absence of controlled tests. There are no prospective, randomized, controlled trials, to our knowledge, of psychotherapy for atypical depression or of cognitive therapy compared with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Since there is only 1 placebo-controlled trial of cognitive therapy, this trial fills a gap in the literature on psychotherapy for depression. <h3>Methods</h3> Outpatients with<i>DSM-III-R</i>major depressive disorder and atypical features (N=108) were treated in a 10-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing acute-phase cognitive therapy or clinical management plus either phenelzine sulfate or placebo. Atypical features were defined as reactive mood plus at least 2 additional symptoms: hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis, or lifetime sensitivity to rejection. <h3>Results</h3> With the use of an intention-to-treat strategy, the response rates (21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, ≤9) were significantly greater after cognitive therapy (58%) and phenelzine (58%) than after pill placebo (28%). Phenelzine and cognitive therapy also reduced symptoms significantly more than placebo according to contrasts after a repeated-measures analysis of covariance and random regression with the use of the blind evaluator's final Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score. The scores between cognitive therapy and phenelzine did not differ significantly. Supplemental analyses of other symptom severity measures confirm the finding. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Cognitive therapy may offer an effective alternative to standard acute-phase treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor for outpatients with major depressive disorder and atypical features.",

      "abstract": "The introduction in clinical practice of new antipsychotic drugs neurologically safer and with a broader spectrum of efficacy than “classical” neuroleptics has brought about significant improvement in the therapy of schizophrenic patients. These second-generation antipsychotics usually called “atypical” antipsychotics, have several therapeutical features in common, such as their effectiveness against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and the advantage of not causing severe extrapyramidal symptoms and hyperprolactinemia. The therapeutic drug monitoring of patients treated with atypical antipsychotics is however, still advisable. In many cases, it can avoid the onset of side and toxic effects due to high plasma levels of the drug caused by overdose or interactions with other drugs. Furthermore, monitoring can significantly improve the patients compliance, thus leading to higher treatment efficacy. The pharmacological properties of the most widely used atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine) will be treated herein with particular attention paid to metabolism, side effects and pharmacokinetics. The analytical methods suitable for the therapeutical drug monitoring of these drugs will also be discussed, in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and usefulness in clinical settings. Other recent atypical agents (ziprasidone, aripiprazole, iloperidone, sertindole and zotepine) will be described as well.

Non-missile injury (or blunt head injury) is usually due to rapid acceleration or deceleration of the head, with or without impact, or less commonly crushing of the head, and most often occur as the result of road traffic accidents or falls. Missile injuries are due to penetration of the skull by a rapidly moving external object, for example gunshot wounds, and result in a different pattern of brain injury. The neuropathology can be separated into focal (or localised) lesions such as contusions, haemorrhages, skull fractures, or diffuse changes such as diffuse axonal injury, diffuse vascular injury, brain swelling and ischaemia (see Table 2.1).",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Sleep disturbance and insomnia are some of the most frequent complaints in patients suffering from depression. Some common antidepressant with excitatory effects may worsen sleep qualities, whereas others (like mirtazapine), thanks to their antihistaminergic action, are associated with sedative properties and can quickly improve sleep quality. In the case of mirtazapine, even if its mechanisms of action on sleep remain controversial, beneficial changes in sleep pattern may be observable since the first dose and are associated with a faster onset of the antidepressive action. Case Presentation. Despite these documented beneficial effects, we reported five cases of elderly patients (age ranging from 69 to 79) with various diagnoses and comorbidities (severe or recurrent depression, general anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, and Parkinson's disease) assessed during clinical daily routine for whom the use of mirtazapine was linked to the onset of nightmares so impressive and dramatic that made it necessary to interrupt the treatment. Discussion. This peculiar side effect is still scarcely documented, and the literature on this topic remains conflicting; however, considering that the cases were collected in a short range of time, the exacerbation of nightmares caused by mirtazapine may be more frequent than previously believed. Furthermore, some common features shared by all the cases reported have been highlighted such as the onset of the nightmares being chronologically associated with the initiation of the therapy with mirtazapine, the disappearance with the interruption, the similar age range of all, and the occurrence of the episodes described during fall season.",

      "abstract": "Acute febrile encechalopathy is a common condition leading to hospital admission in adults and children in India. CNS infections are commonest cause of nontraumatic coma in children. 1 Encephalopathy- a diffuse disease of brain that alters its structure or functionmay be caused by variety of infective, metabolic, toxic, ischemic/hypoxic, nutritional causes or trauma. In febrile illnesses, encephalopathy may result from pathogenic mechanisms affecting nervous system directly or systemic complications like hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, hyperpyrexia, hypoxia, anemia, hepatic/ renal failure and bleeding may contribute to its pathogenesis. The physician/ intensivist is faced with the challenge of emergency management, identification of cause and its treatment not only to ensure survival but also to prevent long-term sequelae, neurological or otherwise. Few of such important clinical situations need elaborate consideration. Encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain parenchyma, presents as diffuse and/or focal neuropsychological dysfunction. From an epidemiologic and pathophysiologic perspective, encephalitis is distinct from meningitis, though on clinical evaluation the two often coexist (meningoencephalitis) with signs and symptoms of meningeal inflammation, such as photophobia, headache, or a stiff neck. Cerebritis describes the stage preceding abscess formation and implies a highly destructive bacterial infection of brain tissue, whereas acute encephalitis tends most commonly to be a viral infection with parenchymal damage ranging from mild to profound. Post monsoon Japanese Encephalitis (JE) epidemics have been reported from Uttar Pradesh, Assam and other parts of the country. JE is the single largest cause of viral encephalitis in world today. The incidence has been reported to be high among pediatric age group with high mortality (30%). 2 Persistent EEG abnormalities are common in children. Brain CT and MRI scans reveal low density areas and abnormal signal intensities in the thalamus, basal ganglia which correlate with clinical findings of tremor, rigidity and abnormal movements that are common in the acute phase of illness. Diagnosis may be established by serological tests and JE virus-specific IgM antibody or RT-PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Since there is no specific anti-viral therapy for JE as of today (Ribavirin is under trial), the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. However, reducing the raised intracranial pressure and controlling convulsions may decrease the mortality and morbidity significantly. No satisfactory treatment exists for the relatively common acute arboviral encephalitides, which vary in epidemiology, mortality and morbidity, if not clinical presentation. Dengue virus encephalopathy is a rare but recognized cause of acute febrile encephalopathy in India and usually occurs in febrile stage. Neurological findings reported in association with dengue include mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies and Guillain Barre’s Syndrome. Around 1-4% of all dengue admissions have clouding of consciousness. Variety of pathological processes like hypotension, cerebral edema, microvascular or frank haemorrhage, hyponatremia and fulminant hepatic failure may interact to cause coma in some of these patients but in others where no such process is identified, isolation of dengue virus from CSF or brain tissue has endorsed the concept of dengue virus itself leading to encephalitis. 3 Clinically distinguishing these acute arboviral encephalitis from the two potentially treatable acute viral encephalitis – a) herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), which is a sporadic and lethal disease of neonates and the general population as well, and b)",

      "abstract": "Lidocaine has been used for more than 50 years for spinal anesthesia and has a remarkable safety record. In 1993, a new adverse effect, transient neurologic toxicity was described in patients recovering from spinal anesthesia with lidocaine. Transient neurological symptoms have been defined as pain in the lower extremities (buttocks, thighs and legs) after an uncomplicated spinal anesthesia and after an initial full recovery during the immediate postoperative period (less than 24 h). The incidence of transient neurological symptoms reported in prospective, randomized trials varies from 4% to 37%. The etiology of transient neurological symptoms remains unkonwn. Despite the transient nature of this syndrome, it has proven to be difficult to treat effectively. Drug or some interventional therapy may be necessary.",

The authors indicate that its lethality and behavioral side effects are significant and may be underestimated. Moderately low overdosage of chloroquine can result in rapid death. Moreover, therapeutic doses are known to cause psychosis, delirium, personality changes, and depression. It is hypothesized that a drug-induced alteration of mood or a toxic confusional state may result in unintended overdosage and death. Clinicians should consider prodromal signs of toxicity and not classify overdosage prematurely as attempted self-poisoning.",

      "title": "Management of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Introduction Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPn) is a common adverse effect of many anticancer drugs, such as platinum analogs, antitubulins (eg, taxanes and vinca alkaloids), bortezomib, and thalidomide. It can present as sensory symptoms in the hands and/or feet, typically in a “stocking-glove” pattern; pain, numbness, or tingling; or motor symptoms, manifested as weakness, cranial nerve deficits, or autonomic neuropathy. In a recent meta-analysis of 31 CIPn studies involving 4179 patients, the aggregate prevalence of CIPn was 48%. Within the first month of completing chemotherapy, the prevalence of CIPn was 68.1%; after 6 or more months of completing chemotherapy, the prevalence of CIPn decreased to 30.0%. The course of CIPn can be unpredictable, and although some symptoms may improve with time, others may persist or worsen as a result of permanent nerve damage. There are limited data on the natural history of CIPn in long-term cancer survivors, who are beyond 1 year of completing chemotherapy. Patients with breast cancer, who received taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, had neuropathy symptoms up to 2 years after completing treatment, and patients with colon cancer receiving oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy had numbness or tingling of hands and feet up to 6 years from starting treatment. One of the challenges in managing and preventing CIPn is that the exact pathophysiology is not well understood. The hypothesized mechanisms of taxane-induced neuropathy include the disruption of the axonal microtubule structure and a deficit in axonal energy supply from the toxic effect of chemotherapy on mitochondria in primary afferent neurons. CIPn due to vinca alkaloid therapy is thought to be due to alterations in the neuronal cytoskeleton that cause axonal degeneration. Platinum agents are thought to cause CIPn by exerting damage in the dorsal root ganglion through mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis, either by Dna crosslinking or oxidative stress. Despite investigations leading to hypotheses of several mechanisms of CIPn, none has resulted in clinically relevant therapeutic interventions. Several studies have attempted to identify risk factors for CIPn development, which also vary with different chemotherapeutic agents. Some of the clinical factors implicated in the development of CIPn include baseline neuropathy, the presence of diabetes, smoking history, and decreased creatinine clearance. In addition, there is interest in pharmacogenomics and identifying genes that may play a role in the development of CIPn. although numerous genes have been investigated, such as GSTP1, CYP2C8, and AGXT, there have been no conclusive findings. One of the clinical implications of CIPn is that the symptoms can result in treatment dose reduction or discontinuation, which may ultimately affect overall survival.

      "abstract": "MEDICALJOUTRNLcases, three (Cases 1, 3, 5) had previously failed to respond satisfactorily to E.C.T.It will be evident from this series that synhexyl is as effective in the milder forms of dysoxia as in the purely neurotic-depressive states.As regards the mechanism of improvement, it should be pointed out that synhexyl does not effect a permanent \" cure \" in the same way as electro-anoxia does in typical dysoxic depressions.The effect lasts only during the period of administration of the drug; it is therefore a substitution therapy, like insulin treatment in diabetes or liver extract in pernicious anaemria.The action would seem to be a combination of stimulation and depression, resulting in a general raising of the anhedonic threshold.The principal site of action of the drug is almost certainly the thalamic centres and their cortical connexions, as is the case with morphine and other powerful central analgesic drugs.The beneficial effects of synhexyl do not appear to be adversely affected by chronicity, concomitant organic disease, or the presence of an organic brain lesion, whether pathologically or surgically induced.There is evidence, however, that drugs of this class are ineffective in the acute dysoxic depressions, and cannot be regarded as substitutes for anoxic therapy in this form of metabolic brain disease.General Conclusions The results of these preliminary trials would suggest that we have in this class of compounds a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of the chronic and intractable depressive states.Synhexyl, the most active of this class, has the advantages of low toxicity, minimum of side- effects, ease of administration, and chemical stability.Its use is not contraindicated by the presence of coexisting organic disease, and it is suitable for out-patient practice.Its use does not interfere with other therapeutic measures, such as occupational therapy and psychotherapy.It is free from the risks and disadvantages of the more drastic forms of treatment, and might replace those methods for the milder depressions of later life where for any reaso-n the more drastic procedures are contraindicated.Its main drawbacks at present are its insoluble nature, slow and uncertain action, and comparatively weak anal- gesic effect, so that it is relatively ineffective in the severer forms of sensory thalamic dysfunction syndrome.Experiments are at present in progress with the object of pro- ducing a water-soluble form with a higher degree of analgesic activity.Summary The syndrome of thalamic dysfunction and the principles of its treatment with euphorigenic drugs are described.The properties and pharmacology of synhexyl, a new drug of the synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol class, are examined.The results of therapeutic trials with the drug in a series of 50 depressive patients are given.My acknowledgments are due to the following: The Research Department of Roche Products Ltd. and",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal status epilepticus in a patient using olanzapine with no known underlying cause or predisposing factor for seizure. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old white woman developed witnessed seizures at home that progressed to status epilepticus. She subsequently died from secondary rhabdomyolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. She had been taking olanzapine for five months prior to the event. No other toxic, metabolic, or anatomic abnormalities were identified pre- or postmortem to explain the seizures. Her seizures were a probable adverse drug reaction based on the Naranjo scale. DISCUSSION: This is the first case of fatal status epilepticus described that has been associated with the use of olanzapine. The pharmacodynamics of olanzapine are similar to those of clozapine, which has been described to induce seizures in 1–4% of patients. It is possible that this patient may have suffered seizures due to a similar effect. Alternate explanations include neuroleptic malignant syndrome and alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal seizures, although her clinical history does not suggest these etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: Although olanzapine has infrequently been associated with seizures in premarketing studies, its potential to induce them exists. Postmarketing surveillance should continue to determine how significant this effect may be.",

      "abstract": "In our outpatient clinic for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 10–20% of those affected repeatedly complained about abnormally extended (24 hours) or (more often) notably shortened or reduced effectiveness of local anesthesia injections for dental treatment. Some patients reported paradoxical reactions to postoperative administration of tranquillizers (including benzodiazepines). These drugs made them “even more awake”, much to their doctor’s surprise.\r\n\r\nOne female patient reported that she had followed the surgeons’ conversations during the initial 10 minutes of the operation under full anesthesia and complete muscle relaxation. The surgeons were surprised at the amount of details she remembered. In other patients, anesthetics worked for ”too long” or had “too strong an effect.”\r\n\r\nMany people with ADHD have next to no reaction or react paradoxically to caffeine (coffee/black tea/cola) and other stimulants (nicotine, “Red Bull,” amphetamines). One female patient also reported excessive awareness —and better cognition—when taking antihistamines (for example, “Fenistil” [dimethindene maleate]).\r\n\r\nSuch “idiosyncratic” reactions seem to be stable over time, which means that the different effects are predictable.\r\n\r\nWe therefore advise our ADHD patients to inform their anesthesiologist before an operation that they may react differently to caffeine, antihistamines/low-potency neuroleptics, benzodiazepines (and also central and peripheral anesthetic drugs).\r\n\r\nMany mentally healthy people also react in a primarily unexpected way to caffeine, etc. It therefore may make sense to ask patients preoperatively about untypical reactions to this (not very long) list of different substances, in order to anticipate possible intraoperative and postoperative problems and to avoid these where possible.\r\n\r\nPresumably such atypical reactions are genetically determined. Therefore “idiosyncrasies” in family members may as well provide a hint for an increased risk of abnormal reactions to anesthetics.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES",

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "abstract": "Critically ill patients are prescribed numerous medications during their ICU stay. Some of them have epileptogenic potentials. The most common pathophysiologic mechanism is through GABA receptor blockade and the most commonly used family of ICU drugs, reducing the seizure threshold, is antibiotics. The exact role that these medications play in inducing a clinical or subclinical seizure, in the context of cerebral injury or other multi-organ failure, is in many cases unclear. The best treatment for drug-induced seizures is increased vigilance and prevention. Cautious measures should be used to minimize or eliminate any unwanted drug side effects by attempting to start and keep the patient on the lowest effective dose for the desired therapeutic effect. When upward dosage titration is necessary it is best to increase slowly while keeping a watchful eye on all laboratory and clinical indicators of success or failure. Free levels of antiepileptic or other medications should be considered in the critically ill, due to numerous factors affecting their final action on the pharmacologic target. If a seizure occurs clinicians should always seek a medication as the cause of the witnessed seizure and should consider replacing it with another agent that has less epileptogenic potential. Lastly, a GABAergic receptor agonist antiepileptic drug should be used as first-line antidote in most of the cases.",

Malarial vertigo has been described by Triantaphyllides,<sup>1</sup>who states that vertigo may be intermittent or permanent, or merely a condition of dizziness, or it may be associated with other neuroses, but in a number of cases which he relates the vertigo could be attributed only to the malaria.

We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

Les propriétés intrinsèques des molécules peuvent expliquer certaines manifestations. Il semble, parmi les médicaments, que l'incidence des convulsions induites par les antidépresseurs tricycliques était particulièrement importante. Parmi les substances illicites, l'utilisation accrue des psychostimulants, principalement de la cocaïne, s'accompagne également fréquemment de convulsions. Les crises convulsives induites par des toxiques sont souvent uniques et de courte durée, cédant parfois avant tout traitement. Elles peuvent cependant évoluer vers un état de mal épileptique. Si les mécanismes physiopathologiques sont similaires à ceux décrits dans l'épilepsie au sens large, il existe cependant quelques mécanismes de toxicité plus spécifique dont la connaissance peut avoir une implication thérapeutique. De même, des facteurs extraneurologiques peuvent aggraver la situation. De nombreuses complications des crises convulsives peuvent être décrites, notamment cardiocirculatoires. Acute or chronic poisoning by drugs, illicit substances, environmental agents can cause seizures with a variable incidence. Seizures may be explained by the intrinsic properties of the drug or toxic agent. Among drugs, the incidence of tricyclic antidepressants induced seizures was particularly high. The increasing use of psychostimulants, like cocaine, is also responsible for frequent seizures. Drug induced seizures are usually brief, single, generalized tonic–clonic and self-limiting. They can even stop before any drug administration. However, they may evolve in some instances to status epilepticus. The mechanisms involved in drug induced seizures are rather similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. Yet, more specific mechanisms are also encountered and they will modify the therapeutic decisions. Also, extraneurological disorders could worsen the clinical condition. Several complications are described, including cardiocirculatory failure.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse consists of the use by a subject without a medical recommendation, in quantities or with nonrecommended methods. Substance abuse also refers to their use in order to increase intellectual or physical performance, against the rules established by society. Substance abuse involves the chronic use of non-medical chemicals for hedonistic or entheogenic purposes [1]. Drugs such as alcohol, antidepressants, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, glue, cocaine, hallucinogens, metacular, narcotics, opiates, sedatives, stimulants and some organic solvents can be named [2]. Substance abuse can cause criminal or antisocial behavior, may generate long-term changes in personality [3]. Cocaine has major toxic effects on the body. Treatment of cocaine poisoning is complex. The main sales are those that can lead to patient death. For the proper treatment of any inoculation, it is necessary to identify the xenobiotic that generated it. The presence of metabolites, in the case of cocaine - ethylbenzoylcogene (EBE), provides information on the time of administration of the xenobiotic. Gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is an optoelectronic method that can identify the presence of cocaine and / or EBE from biological samples. In order to increase the sensitivity of the method, a special mass metrology technique - MS/MS can be used [4, 5].",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive agents have been in use for the treatment of psychotic children since the 1930s. In those early years only hypnotics and anticonvulsants were available and they were administered chiefly for the management of excitement and agitation. The discovery of chlorpromazine (Delay & Deniker, 1952) and other neuroleptics resulted in a revolution in the treatment of psychoses of adults. It was hoped that these drugs would arrest or decrease the psychotic process in the child and that after the reduction of anxiety, hyperactivity, and/or aggressiveness he would become more amenable to special education and other treatment modalities. These hopes were not always fulfilled. Drug therapy has come under attack because of improper use, especially with institutionalized retarded Children. This abuse has included high dosage over prolonged periods of time, multiple drug usage—children receiving from two to eight drugs at the same time—no drug holidays, little or no evidence of drug monitoring, and usage of sedative types of phenothiazines which probably suppress cognitive learning functions (Lipman, 1970).",

While the movements are said to be fully involuntary, there is often some suggestibility. In the case of unilaterally predominant tremor, if the patient is requested to repeat voluntary movements with the intact or less affected hand at a certain pace, the tremor frequency might be replaced by the frequency of the voluntary movement, the phenomenon called entrainment.",

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

AIM: to present prehospital at-the-scene measures in treatment of a patient with acute symptomatic epi attack. to point out the significance of correctly taken anamnesis and the dispatcher's role in the operation of Emergency Medical Service Teams. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive overview of data, a dispatcher's protocol , a physician's protocol, and 2005 guidelines of good clinical practice for consciousness crises, the patient's discharge note. CASE STUDY: At 3 minutes past 12, the emergency team received a radio call that a female person 58 years of age lost consciousness. The dispatcher gave the information that the patient lost consciousness, that she was shaking, had turned blue and was breathing very heavily. The patient was found awake, confused, cyanotic, with traces of blood on her lips. The primary examination showed that the patient wasdyspnoic, with diminished breath sound over lungs, with extended expirium, presence of polyphonic wheezes over both lungs. SaO92%, rhythmic heart action, tachycardic, about 110/min. TA 160/100 mmHg. Abite was noticeable on the right side of the tongue. According to the consciousness crisis protocol, the temperature was taken, T 36.8 C, and glycemia 3.2mmol/l. A general neurological finding indicated slightly larger pupils, with a normal reaction to light, meningeal signs were negative, there were no signs of pyramidal lateralization. It became clear that the patient had an acute symptomatic epi attack. A question was raised whether the cause of attack was hypoxia, aminophylline overdose, or mild hypoglycemia. The patient remained confused all the time; she did not cooperate during examination. The dispatcher confirmed through the radio system that the patient did not have any epilepsy treatment and that she was an insulin dependent diabetic. Intravenous route was provided, and solution of 10% Glucose 250ml, corticosteroid therapy and oxygenotherapy were administered. The state of consciousness of the patient improved completely during transportation to the Admissions Department of Valjevo Hospital. CONCLUSION: In order for the treatment of these patients to be successful, it is necessary to recognize in the shortest possible time interval the symptoms of acute symptomatic attacks, taking into consideration that they do not have medical and social consequences of epileptic attacks and are not treated by administering antiepileptic medications. The therapeutic approach is based on the treatment of primary disease, i.e. elimination of immediate provoking factor.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia pain and its modulation by hypnotic and non‐hypnotic suggestion: An fMRI analysis",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The neuropsychological status of pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, commonly categorized as ‘psychosomatic’ or ‘functional’ disorders, remains controversial. Activation of brain structures dependent upon subjective alterations of fibromyalgia pain experience could provide an insight into the underlying neuropsychological processes. Suggestion following a hypnotic induction can readily modulate the subjective experience of pain. It is unclear whether suggestion without hypnosis is equally effective. To explore these and related questions, suggestions following a hypnotic induction and the same suggestions without a hypnotic induction were used during functional magnetic resonance imaging to increase and decrease the subjective experience of fibromyalgia pain. Suggestion in both conditions resulted in significant changes in reported pain experience, although patients claimed significantly more control over their pain and reported greater pain reduction when hypnotised. Activation of the midbrain, cerebellum, thalamus, and midcingulate, primary and secondary sensory, inferior parietal, insula and prefrontal cortices correlated with reported changes in pain with hypnotic and non‐hypnotic suggestion. These activations were of greater magnitude, however, when suggestions followed a hypnotic induction in the cerebellum, anterior midcingulate cortex, anterior and posterior insula and the inferior parietal cortex. Our results thus provide evidence for the greater efficacy of suggestion following a hypnotic induction. They also indicate direct involvement of a network of areas widely associated with the pain ‘neuromatrix’ in fibromyalgia pain experience. These findings extend beyond the general proposal of a neural network for pain by providing direct evidence that regions involved in pain experience are actively involved in the generation of fibromyalgia pain.",

      "title": "Excited delirium syndrome",
      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Long-time consumption of narcotics leads to altered mental status of the addict. It is also connected to damages of different organic systems and it often leads to ap- pearance of multiple organ failure. Excessive narcotics con- sumption or abuse in a long time period can lead to various consequences, such as atraumatic rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and electrolytic disorders. Rhabdomyolysis is charac- terized by injury of skeletal muscle with subsequent release of intracellular contents, such as myoglobin, potassium and cre- atine phosphokinase. In heroin addicts, rhabdomyolysis is a consequence of the development of a compartment syndrome due to immobilization of patients in the state of unconscious- ness and prolonged compression of extremities, direct heroin toxicity or extremities ischemia caused by intraluminal occlu- sion of blood vessels after intraarterial injection of heroin. Se- vere hyperkalemia and the development of acute renal failure require urgent therapeutic measures, which imply the applica- tion of either conventional treatment or a form of dialysis.

      "abstract": "Spasticity and dystonia are two neurological conditions with a broad range of clinical manifestations that can emerge at any age. Although the spasticity and dystonia symptoms are caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms, both of them may cause functional impairment that contributes to a poor quality of life. Spasticity is characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. It mostly occurs in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) affecting the upper motor neurons, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Therapeutic options may combine, in various proportions, physical therapy, occupational therapy, self-rehabilitation, the use of orthoses and assistive devices, drug treatment, orthopaedic surgery, and neurosurgery. Dystonia is defined as a syndrome of involuntary movement that manifests as excessive muscle contractions that frequently cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. It is often intensified or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles. Dystonia has many different manifestations and causes, and many different treatment options are available. These options include physical and occupational therapy, oral medications, intramuscular injection of botulinum toxins, and neurosurgical interventions.",

Status epileptici are usually triggered by a combination of factors including sleep deprivation, alcohol withdrawal, failure to take medication regularly and fever. In status epilepticus epileptic seizures and EEG discharges initially appear to be no different from isolated seizures. The longer the status epilepticus continues, however, the more atypical the seizures and EEG discharges become. Usually status epilepticus ends gradually. Irreversible damage or fatalities may occur especially in infants or under certain conditions (e.g. long status duration, protracted interval between seizure onset and medical treatment and symptomatic etiology). In most cases benzodiazepines and diphenylhydantoine are the preferred drugs used for treatment.",

Only rarely may camptocormia be attributable to psychiatric disease. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings, imaging of the cerebrum or spine, needle electromyography, or muscle biopsy. Treatment options are limited and frequently futile and rely on conservative measures, such as psychotherapy, physiotherapy, use of orthoses, drugs, injection of botulinum toxin, withdrawal of causative drugs, electroconvulsive therapy, or invasive measures, such as surgical correction or deep brain stimulation. The outcome is generally fair. Some patients profit from therapy whereas others do not respond to treatment and become progressively immobile.",

This article is a part of the Guidelines for Epilepsy in India. This article reviews the problem of provoked seizure and its management and also provides recommendations based on currently available information. Seizure provoked by metabolic disturbances requires correction of the triggering factors. Benzodiazepines are recommended for treatment of seizure due to alcohol withdrawal; gabapentin for seizure seen in porphyria; and antiepileptic drugs (AED), that are not inducer of hepatic enzymes, in the seizures seen in hepatic dysfunction. In severe traumatic brain injury, with or without seizure, phenytoin (PHT) may be given for 7 days. In ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke one may individualize the AED therapy. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), AED may be prescribed if there is seizure or computed tomographic (CT) abnormalities or focal weakness; the treatment, in these cases, has to be continued for 1 year. Prophylactic AED is not recommended in cases of brain tumor and neurosurgical procedures and if patient is on an AED it can be stopped after 1 week.",

The essential importance to keep separated the akinetic-hypertonic syndromes from the hypotonic-hyperkinetic ones is further confirmed. In fact two different chemical mediating agents work separately in these two cases: the Dopamine for the Nigro-Striatal system and the Ach for other tracts whose anatomy is still not well known, but which surely belong to the extrapyramidal system. Further more a clinical case of dyskinetic-athetosic post-infective syndrome, successfully treated with L.D., is discussed. The effectiveness of neuroleptic drugs in these hypotonic-hyperkinetic syndrome is stressed while they cause and worsen extra-pyramidal symptoms such as hypertonia and akynesia (hypertonic akinetic s.).",

It appears in the course of numerous diseases including diabetic polyneuropathy or polyneuropathy with a different etiology, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia and root syndromes. A typical feature of neuropathic pain is poor response to standard analgesia. In the treatment of neuropathic pain, the first-line drugs are antiepileptic drugs (gabapentin and pregabalin, or carbamazepine) and antidepressants (amitriptyline and duloxetine). In the case of insufficient efficacy of the above drugs, the addition of acetaminophen or opioid (for example tramadol) may be considered. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain [1, 2].",

      "abstract": "Neurobehavioural sequelae of traumatic brain injuries require an appropriate/effective pharmacological response in that they represent an important cause of disability. In this field, there is no evidence that reaches the level of a standard: there are guidelines on the use of methylphenidate, donepezil and bromocriptine for the treatment of cognitive disturbances, for the non-use of phenytoin and for the use of beta-blockers for controlling aggressiveness. Resolving a single symptom is not relevant in a rehabilitation project if it is not in the context of a more complex picture of neurobehavioural recovery, in which the positive and negative effects of every therapeutic choice are considered. For example, phenytoin could be used for the positive control of epileptic crises but is not advised since it impedes the recovery of cognitive functions in general. Analogous effects not yet identified may concern benzodiazepine, neuroleptics and other sedatives usually prescribed in cases of cranial trauma. Psychotropic drugs are considered to be able to influence the neuronal plasticity processes. Studies on animals have shown that the administration of D-amphetamine combined with sensorial-motor exercise produces the steady acceleration of motor recovery, which acts as a catalyst to the neurological recovery process. On the other hand, alpha1-NA receptor antagonist drugs produce negative effects; these include clonidine (antihypertension) and haloperidol (neuroleptic). Studies need to be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of particular drugs. These studies need to focus not only on the disappearance of symptoms but also on the positive and negative effects on overall rehabilitation and on the neurobiological recovery of the patient.",

Serious problems especially arise from cardiac (toxic myocarditis, QT prolongation, and other ventricular arrhythmias), muscular (intermediate syndrome, OPIDN), and neuro-behavioral (regressive psychosis, cognitive, mnesic and perceptive alterations) sequelae. Such complications, caused by direct neuronal, cardiac, and muscular damage, sneaky appear immediately after resolution of cholinergic crisis. Early establishment of antidotal (atropine + oximes) and supportive therapy, while reducing duration and seriousness of cholinergic crisis, should increase survival rates. In order to improve \"quoad valetudinem\" prognosis, widespread use of benzodiazepines is still recommended: such drugs antagonize some central signs and symptoms of cholinergic attack insensitive to atropine (fasciculations, muscular spasms, seizures, anxiety, psychomotor agitation). Moreover, they attenuate neuronal, cardiac, and muscular damage, caused by cholinergic overstimulation, which is responsible for invalidating outcome.",

      "title": "Tolerance and addiction; the patient, the parent or the clinician?",
      "abstract": "Summary Tolerance has been recognized for some time where chronic exposure to certain drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and opioids, is associated with apparent tachyphylaxis. When these drugs are stopped or progressively reduced as in ‘tapering’, withdrawal symptoms may result. Tolerance and the flip side of the coin, withdrawal, are the determinants of addiction. It is increasingly apparent that tolerance can occur acutely, even within the time span of a single anesthetic for a surgical procedure. Addiction is caused by agents, foreign to the body, that provoke adaptation by homeostatic biological processes. When these agents are withdrawn, the adaptive mechanisms, devoid of substrate, take time to diminish and produce symptoms recognizable under the term of ‘withdrawal’. Children may be exposed to these agents in different ways; in utero , as a result of substances that the mother ingests by enteral, parenteral or inhalational means that are transmitted to the infant via the placenta; as a result of an anesthetic for surgery; or as a result of sedation and analgesia administered to offset the stresses and trauma inherent from intensive care treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit or pediatric intensive care unit. Additionally, anesthetic and intensive care staff are exposed to powerful and addictive drugs as part of everyday practice, not simply by overt access, but also by subliminal environmental exposure.",

      "abstract": "Objectives To underline the importance of a correct diagnosis and management of catatonia and complications increasing its morbidity and mortality. Catatonia is a syndrome of altered motor behaviour, mainly classified as a form of schizophrenia. Recent literature suggests catatonia is an independent syndrome, frequent among patients diagnosed with mania/depression or accompanying many general medical conditions and neurological disorders. Methods We describe the case of a 58-year-old woman with NIDDM in antidiabetic oral therapy and history of schizophrenia, diagnosed when aged 20 and treated with Haloperidol (10 mg/day), Levomepromazine (100 mg/day) and Lorazepam (2.5 mg/day) who was admitted to our clinic for a condition characterized by mutacism, staring into space, muscular rigidity and bilateral arm cogwheeling, initially suggesting a neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Results At hospitalization there was no fever, leukocytosis or CPK elevation. She quickly developed altered consciousness, autonomic dysfunction (hypertension, dysphagia, uncontrolled hyperglycaemia) and waxy flexibility finally recognized as a catatonic syndrome, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Multiple infections (urinary trait infection, teeth infections leading to sepsis) worsened her clinical condition. The first therapeutic strategy was suspending neuroleptics. Psychomotor symptoms, rated with the Catatonia Rating Scale (CRS), gradually resolved by intravenous administration of Lorazepam high doses (up to 12 mg/day). General medical conditions improved with specific antibiotic therapy, endovenous hydratation and parenteral nutrition. A physiatric rehabilitation program was started, with significative motricity improvement. Conclusions This report underlines the importance of the differential diagnosis between catatonia and similar conditions (such as NMS) and the fundamental role of multidisciplinary approach to complications.",

Cycloid psychoses and bouffée delirante are recognized in ICD-10 under the name of acute polymorphic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.0) and with symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.1). Objectives Clinical case Methods We present the case of a 16-year-old patient with no psychiatric history, with medical background of epilepsy; she was in fllow-up by Neurology and in treatment with valproate.Neurology indicates to stop treatment; it is then whwn the patient begins to appear disoriented, confused, with significant anguish and lability and regressive behaviors.She has sudden mood swings (from laughing to crying); sudden changes in emotional reaction (from distress to anger) and sudden changes in behavior (from agitation to prostration); verbiage with pressure of speech and dysprosodia; delusional ideation and incongruous affect; visual, auditive and kinesthetic hallucinations with important repercussion. We request blood and urine tests, drug test, EEG, cranial MRI. Results She presents fluctuating, polymorphic and unstable affective and psychotic symptoms. What is the most appropriate diagnosis? We treat the patient with antipsychotic, mood stabilizer and anxiolytic treatment. Conclusions Psychopathology in early ages is not so clearly defined and it can take very different forms.

This results in tachycardia, hypertension, regional reductions in blood flow, altered immune responses, hyperglycemia, lipolysis, and negative nitrogen balance, all of which may play a role in postoperative morbidity and mortality (1,2). Opioids are the mainstay of managing most acute pain. There are times, however, when reducing the amount of opioid may be desirable for a number of reasons, including patient age, comorbidities, and intolerance of adverse effects from the medication. In these situations, the addition of nondrug methods to manage acute pain can be very useful in promoting comfort and improving outcomes.

Argininemia is a disorder in which the clinical picture is quite different from the other disorers of the urea cycle. Patients with argininemia are often recognized as abnormal because of failure to pass developmental milestones. With the advent of spasticity or opisthotonus, they may be first thought to have cerebral palsy. Patients with argininemia may have episodic vomiting and hyperammonemia. The clinical features may include progressive gait abnormalities due to spasticity, as well as acute episodes of ataxia, behavior disturbances (aggression, hyperactivity, and irritability), vomiting, lethargy, and seizures.",

      "abstract": "After an experimental application of electroshock a prior stressful event was disregarded—Stripped of its associative connections—in the manner consistent with the defensive operation known as isolation. Neutral events that occurred both before and after the stressful event were clearly remembered after the electroshock. Clinical studies to be reported elsewhere (I) indicate that the arousal or enhancing of active defensive operations appears to be the most decisive effect of convulsive electroshock treatment. It is probably for that reason that ECT is helpful in those conditions in which defensive operations are at a low ebb, ineffective or exhausted, such as in depression and other severely regressive psychotic states, but that it is ineffective—in fact disturbing—in those conditions in which defensive operations are already too disturbingly alerted, constituting an obstacle to treatment and recovery, such as in anxiety states.",

These drugs can relieve the pain within the body by blocking the neurotransmitters or chemicals that cause pain in the body. Opioids can work in both the ascending pathways of the brain as well as the descending pathways of the brain for pain modulation. Fentanyl is more potent than morphine and herion. Fentanyl is also given as transdermal patches or lozenges in the treatment of pain management. Fentanyl is also sold illegally and can cause of death too when abused. Because of its strong property to be addicted, fentanyl also is mixed with the heroine. Moreover, fentanyl has its own effects during withdrawal, which causes behaviour changes. Fentanyl can bind to μ-opioid receptors (MORs) to exert its effects. In addition, fentanyl abuse is becoming more common globally. Fentanyl causes the brain to suffocate by decreasing the oxygen supply, causing hypoxia and hyperglycemia as well. Fentanyl abuse can cause serious cognitive issues, leading to severe structural damage manifested as hormonal and neuronal disturbances. By suppressing the two brainstem areas, opioids cause disturbances to breathing.",

      "title": "Overview of Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "Abstract A seizure (also called attack, crisis, turn, fit, breakout, trembling, convulsion, and insult) is usually defined as a sudden alteration of behavior due to a temporary change in the electrical functioning of the brain, in particular the outer layer of the brain called the cortex. Epilepsy means recurrent seizures. Seizures can take many different forms, as the descriptions in this book indicate. However, any given person usually has a limited number of different types of seizures that they experience, and readers should understand that seizures affect different people in different ways. The material in this book points out these differences, but should not be taken to imply that every person with seizures will experience everything described in this book at some time. Sometimes, seizures can be triggered by alcohol, strong emotions, intense exercise, flashing lights or loud music, illness and fever, the menstrual period, lack of sleep, and stress. Often an individual learns to recognize what they may be susceptible to. Sometimes there is no identifiable or consistent trigger. Seizures have a beginning, a middle, and an end. When an individual is aware of the beginning, it may be thought of as a warning. Another word used for the warning is the aura. Auras are actually seizures that affect only a very small part of the brain; enough to cause symptoms, but not enough to disrupt consciousness. Doctors may refer to auras as “simple partial seizures”—“simple” means that consciousness is not impaired, and “partial” means that only part of the brain is involved with the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders. The article provides review on most significant neurobehavioral manifestations of developmental impairment of the brain during prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal period.

The findings at necropsy were not sufficient to explain either her death or her psychotic behavior. The terminal period was brief, lasting minutes. Contrastingly, sudden deaths in schizophrenic patients reported in the earlier literature generally were characterized by a terminal period lasting hours or days. The role of phenothiazines in the death of our patient is uncertain. Nonetheless, one should remain alert to the possibility of massive brain-stem inhibition occurring in patients receiving large doses of phenothiazines. The character of our patient's death closely simulates sudden death as described by several authors in physically well adults. These deaths were unrelated to medication and were considered as primarily the result of a physiologic or psychophysiologic hyperreactive state.",

A syndrome of indifference has also been described as another possible side effect. The frequency of those phenomena and their physiopatholo gy are unknown. They are both considered benign and reversible after antidepressant discontinuation but severe cases with complications as temporomandibular lesions, have been described. Methods: We report two unprecedented cases in which excessive yawning and indifference occurred simultaneously as side effects of antidepressant therapy, discussing possible physiopathological mechanisms for this co-occurrence. Case 1: A male patient presented excessive yawning (approximately 80/day) and apathy after venlafaxine XR treatment. Symptoms reduced after a switch to escitalopram, with a reduction to 50 yawns/day. Case 2: A female patient presented excessive yawning (approximately 25/day) and inability to react to environmental stressors with desvenlafaxine. Conclusion: Induction of indifference and excessive yawning may be modulated by serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms. One proposal to unify these side effects would be enhancement of serotonin in midbrain, espe cially paraventricular and raphe nucleus.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, tenderness, fatigue and associated symptoms which include cognitive difficulties, abdominal symptoms etc. A leading paradigm regarding the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia (and similar functional disorders) focuses on the concept of central sensitization. This concept describes a situation in which there is an increased sensitivity of the central nervous system to the processing and transmission of pain, leading to the development of clinical phenomena such as allodynia and hyperalgesia. Various lines of evidence have contributed to the development of the central sensitization paradigm. A decrease in the capacity of the nervous system to perform descending pain inhibition is one aspect of this paradigm. Increased windup and long term potentiation are additional phenomena. An increase in the CSF-level of pain-facilitating neurotransmitters, coupled with a decrease in pain inhibitory transmitters, has also been described. Novel mechanisms such as microglia cell activation are under investigation. Certain clinical characteristics may alert the clinician to the possibility that a patient is suffering from centralized pain (i.e. fibromyalgia or related syndromes). Multiple sites of pain are typical, as well as a long history of pain- related complaints in the same patients. Disturbed sleep, fatigue and dyscognition are typical. Various triggers such as physical trauma, infection and stress are often reported and tenderness is demonstrable on physical examination. Functional imaging of the central nervous system, including techniques such as fMRI, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and resting connectivity analysis, are improving our understanding regarding the neural mechanism underlying central sensitization.",

The neglect of nondopaminergic symptoms is surprising because i) they occur in almost all patients with PD throughout the course of the disease,(1) and can even precede the occurrence of the classic motor symptoms; ii) they affect almost all aspects of daily life; and iii) have a greater effect on health-related quality of life than dopaminergic symptoms.(2) During the last decade, several initiatives have addressed this deficit with specific assessment procedures for application in clinical practice and research.(1.)",

Benzydamine hydrochloride overdose can cause stimulation of central nervous system, hallucinations, and psychosis. We presented a young man with psychotic symptoms due to benzydamine hydrochloride abuse. He received a total dose of 1000 mg benzydamine hydrochloride with alcohol for its hallucinative effects. Misuse of benzydamine hydrochloride must be considered in differential diagnosis of first-episode psychosis and physicians should consider possibility of abuse in prescribing.",

      "abstract": "The multiple manifestations of depression may mimic those associated with many physical illnesses, leading to delay in diagnosis. The consequences of depression are disability, suffering, and sometimes death by suicide. Antidepressant drugs have greatly improved the prognosis for the depressed patient. Tricyclics are the drugs of first choice, with monoamine oxidase inhibitors playing a secondary role except in special instances. Drugs can be used along with electroconvulsive therapy when treatment is urgent. Differences in the pharmacologic effects of tricyclics may affect their choice for individual patients. Monitoring of plasma concentrations of tricyclics may uncover some sources of drug failure, such as altered drug kinetics in an individual patient or noncompliance with treatment. Side-effects of antidepressant drugs are numerous; most represent extensions of known pharmacologic actions. Overdoses produce severe intoxications that require expert and assiduous management.",

      "title": "Why are doctors still prescribing neuroleptics?",
      "abstract": "There are two main pharmacological methods of suppressing undesired behaviour: sedation or neuroleptics. Traditionally, the invention of neuroleptics has been hailed as one of the major clinical breakthroughs of the twentieth century, since they calmed agitation without (necessarily) causing sedation. The specifically neuroleptic form of behavioural control is achieved by making patients psychologically Parkinsonian, which entails emotional blunting and consequent demotivation. Furthermore, chronic neuroleptic usage creates dependence, so that in the long term, neuroleptics are doing most patients more harm than good. The introduction of ‘atypical’ neuroleptics (neuroleptically-weak but strongly sedative neuroleptics) has made only a difference in degree, and at the cost of a wide range of potentially fatal metabolic and other side-effects. For half a century, the creation of millions of Parkinsonian patients may have been misinterpreted as a ‘cure’ for schizophrenia. Such a wholesale re-interpretation of neuroleptic therapy represents an unprecedented disaster for the self-image and public reputation of both psychiatry and the whole medical profession. Nonetheless, except as a last resort, neuroleptics should swiftly be replaced by gentler and safer sedatives.",

Patients were incorrectly diagnosed as epilepsy, conversion (pseudo seizure), or hypochondriasis.In the present series, there were eight men and four women with age ranging from 13 to 72 years. All patients had been taking both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs for at least one year. Strong involuntary movement disorders, torticollis, scoliosis, body pain, difficulty in swallowing, and aphonia were observed Most patients were thin and anemic. They responded well to diazepam, anticholinergic drug, clonazepam lithium, and antidepressant while antipsychotic drugs were discontinued in most cases. Calcium salt and iron supplement appeared to be useful.Physicians should be aware of these abnormal movement disorders induced by AP drugs to detect early and provide prompt treatment.

      "title": "Aggravation of epilepsy by anti‐epileptic drugs",
      "abstract": "The possibility that so‐called anti‐epileptic drugs (AEDs) may aggravate epilepsy must always be borne in mind by the clinician. Many reports of such aggravation of seizures have been published. Most such reports are anecdotal and speculative, and suggest that many such reactions are idiosyncratic. However, for some there is a sufficient body of evidence to suggest that some AEDs used in certain epilepsies may consistently cause worsening of seizures. Seizure aggravation may include increase in the frequency or severity of existing seizures, emergence of new types of seizure, or the occurrence of status epilepticus. The pathophysiology of seizure aggravation is poorly understood including nonspecific effects such as those associated with sedation, druginduced encephalopathy, and paradoxical or inverse pharmacodynamic effects. For some epilepsies the choice of AEDs may be inappropriate, and although the mechanism of seizure aggravation is not clear, its occurrence may be fairly predictable. This is best documented for the use of carbamazepine in idiopathic generalized and myoclonic epilepsies. Most other AEDs have been reported occasionally to cause seizure aggravation. The lowest risk of seizure aggravation appears to be with valproate. Risk factors for worsening of seizures are epileptic encephalopathy, polytherapy, high frequency of seizures, and cognitive impairment. Advances in pharmacogenomics may in the future enable such adverse effects to be predicted for individual patients. Meanwhile, a systematic approach to reporting AED‐induced seizure aggravation should be developed.",

(1)Patients with frozen shoulder typically experience insidious shoulder stiffness, severe pain that usually worsens at night, and near-complete loss of passive and active external rotation of the shoulder. (2)There are typically no significant findings in the patient's history, clinical examination or radiographic evaluation to explain the loss of motion or pain.Frozen shoulder can be classified as primary or secondary.Primary idiopathic frozen shoulder is often associated with other diseases and conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, and may be the first presentation of a diabetic patient. (3)Patients with systemic diseases such as thyroid diseases (4,5) and Parkinson's disease (6) are at higher risk.Secondary adhesive capsulitis can occur after shoulder injuries or immobilisation (e.g.rotator cuff tendon tear, subacromial impingement, biceps tenosynovitis and calcific tendonitis).These patients develop pain from the shoulder pathology, leading to reduced movement in that shoulder and thus developing frozen shoulder.Frozen shoulder often progresses in three stages: the freezing (painful), frozen (adhesive) and thawing phases (Fig. 1).In the freezing stage, which lasts about 2-9 months, there is a gradual onset of diffuse, severe shoulder pain that typically worsens at night.The pain will begin to subside during the frozen stage with a characteristic progressive loss of glenohumeral flexion, abduction, internal rotation and external rotation.This stage can last for 4-12 months.During the thawing stage, the patient experiences a gradual return of range of motion that takes about 5-26 months to complete. (7,8)Although adhesive capsulitis is often self-limiting, usually resolving in 1-3 years, (9) it can persist, presenting symptoms that are commonly mild; pain is the most common complaint. (10,11)",

PKD is not commonly reported in Tourette syndrome (TS). We describe a unique case of TS with PKD-like episodic dyskinesia that responded to carbamazepine. <strong>Case Report:</strong> A 36-year-old male with long-standing TS developed paroxysmal ‘‘cramping’’. Attacks were provoked by quick, sudden arm movements, which induced dystonic cramping, or by reaching overhead, which caused painful contraction of truncal muscles. The spells typically lasted 5–20 seconds and occurred multiple times daily. The patient’s mother suffered from intermittent dystonic toe curling. In view of the similarity of symptoms to PKD, carbamazepine was prescribed at 400 mg daily. The symptoms resolved completely. Inadvertent discontinuation led to relapse, and resumption led to recapture of benefit. <strong>Discussion:</strong> This case demonstrates the possibility that PKD-like symptoms may co-occur with TS and may be responsive to carbamazepine.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

      "title": "Differential modulation by Sigma-1 receptors of µ opioid-induced antinociception and side effects : role of periperial sigma-1 receptors",
      "abstract": "Titulo de la Tesis Doctoral: Differential modulation by sigma-1 receptors of µ- opioid-induced antinociception and side effects: Role of peripheral sigma-1 receptors\nDoctorando: Cristina Sanchez Fernandez\nIntroduccion\nLos agonistas opioides se usan en clinica como analgesicos, principalmente aquellos del subtipo µ, tales como fentanilo, oxicodona, morfina, buprenorfina y tramadol. Esta accion analgesica la producen principalmente a nivel central (p.ej. Christie et al., 2000; Khalefa et al., 2012). Ademas de la analgesia, estos farmacos producen otros efectos derivados principalmente de sus acciones a nivel central, incluyendo confusion mental y depresion respiratoria, entre otros efectos adversos de relevancia clinica (revisado en Waldhoer et al., 2004 y Al-Hasani and Bruchas, 2011). Los opioides tambien producen efectos perifericos, ya que disminuyen el transito intestinal principalmente por su efecto inhibitorio de la actividad del plexo mienterico (Holzer et al., 2009; Brock et al., 2012). Este efecto de los opioides se utiliza clinicamente para el tratamiento sintomatico de la diarrea, concretamente mediante el uso de loperamida. Este farmaco es un agonista opioide que actua exclusivamente a nivel periferico (Menendez et al., 2005), y que, por lo tanto, es capaz de inhibir el transito intestinal aunque carece de efectos centrales (Gallelli et al., 2010), por lo que no se utiliza clinicamente como analgesico.\nEl receptor sigma-1 (sigma-1) es una proteina neuromoduladora cuya farmacologia esta bien descrita en la actualidad, habiendo disponibles tanto antagonistas (BD-1063, BD-1047, NE-100 y S1RA) como agonistas (PRE-084 y (+)-pentazocina) selectivos (Cobos et al., 2008; Romero et al., 2012). Se sabe que la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 a nivel central potencia la analgesia opioide (Mei y Pasternak, 2002 y 2007; Marrazzo et al., 2006). Sin embargo, se desconoce si este receptor es capaz de modular la analgesia opioide a nivel periferico o si su inhibicion tambien podria incrementar los efectos no analgesicos de los opioides, lo cual limitaria su utilidad clinica. Desafortunadamente, la inhibicion del transito intestinal tambien es producida por los opioides analgesicos (con penetrabilidad central) y tiene un gran impacto en la calidad de vida del paciente, ya que el estrenimiento producido por estos farmacos es la causa principal de abandono voluntario de medicacion opioide por los pacientes (Dhingra et al., 2013).\n Objetivos\nEl objetivo principal de esta Tesis fue estudiar el papel neuromodulador del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica en el raton, asi como en varios efectos no analgesicos (adversos) de los opioides.\n Resultados\nLos resultados mostraron que la inhibicion genetica del receptor sigma-1 (KO-sigma-1) o farmacologica, administrando por via subcutanea (s.c.) o intraplantar (i.pl.) antagonistas selectivos sigma-1 (BD-1063, BD-1047, NE-100 y S1RA) carecia de efectos antinociceptivos por si mismo. Sin embargo, la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 potencio el efecto analgesico de los agonistas opioides al aplicar un estimulo mecanico doloroso (450 g de presion en la pata trasera). Los ratones KO-sigma-1 tratados s.c. con opioides fentanilo, oxicodona, morfina, buprenorfina, o tramadol, mostraron un marcado aumento del efecto analgesico respecto a los ratones salvajes (WT). La administracion sistemica (s.c) de antagonistas selectivos sigma-1 a ratones WT tratados por via sistemica con dosis bajas de agonistas opioides consiguio una potenciacion similar a la registrada en ratones KO-sigma-1. El efecto de los antagonistas sigma-1 fue totalmente revertido por el agonista selectivo sigma-1 PRE-084, indicando la selectividad de los efectos observados.\nPara estudiar la importancia de los receptores opioides perifericos en el efecto analgesico de los opioides administrados por via sistemica, observado tanto en una situacion normal o de bloqueo del receptor sigma-1, se administro naloxona metiodida, un agonista opioide periferico (Menendez et al., 2005). Los resultados mostraron que la potenciacion del efecto analgesico de los opioides por la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1, era marcadamente mas sensible al antagonista periferico que la analgesia observada en una situacion normal, indicando el papel clave de los opioides perifericos en la potenciacion del efecto analgesico al bloquear el receptor sigma-1.\nAdemas, la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 (en ratones KO-sigma-1 o mediante antagonistas sigma-1 en ratones WT) fue capaza desenmascarar el efecto analgesico de la loperamida, que en circunstancias normales no induce ningun efecto antinociceptivo. Estos datos refuerzan la importancia de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica.\nPosteriormente estudiamos si el bloqueo del receptor sigma-1 a nivel local era suficiente para aumentar el efecto analgesico de ratones tratados sistemicamente con dosis bajas de opioides. La administracion i.pl. de los antagonistas selectivos BD sigma-1 (BD-1063 y S1RA), potencio el efecto analgesico de los opioides solo en la pata adminsitrada, no observandose un aumento en la contralateral, confirmandose asi el efecto a nivel periferico de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1. Esta potenciacion fue revertida por el agonista selectivo sigma-1 PRE-084 asi como por la administracion de naloxona metiodida, lo que indica que el efecto observado depende de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 y de la activacion de los receptores opioides perifericos.\nPor ultimo, evaluamos los efectos de la adminsitracion local (i.pl.) de morfina en ratones WT y KO-sigma-1. En ratones WT no se observo efecto alguno, mientras que en los ratones KO-sigma-1 se observo un claro efecto dosis-dependiente en la pata tratada pero no en la contralateral. Ademas, la coadministracion i.pl. de morfina con BD-1063 indujo un marcado efecto antinociceptivo comparable al de los ratones KO-sigma-1. Cabe destacar que la administracion de diversos antagonistas sigma-1 carecio de efectos en ratones KO-sigma-1, como cabria esperar, ya que su diana farmacologica esta ausente en estos animales (y confirmando la especificidad del efecto de los farmacos). Estos resultados indican que pese a que la morfina en una situacion normal no ejerce efectos analgesicos locales, estos pueden desenmascararse mediante la inhibicion de los receptores sigma-1.\nNuestros resultados obtenidos en ratones KO-sigma-1 no pueden explicarse por posibles cambios adaptativos en los receptores µ en los ratones mutantes, ya que estudios con el radioligando selectivo µ [3H]DAMGO, mostraron que los ratones de ambos genotipos poseen receptores µ farmacologicamente equivalentes (en afinidad y densidad de sitios de fijacion reconocidos por el radioligando) en tejido de cerebro, medula espinal y piel plantar. Ademas, tambien descartamos que hubiera interacciones cruzadas entre los ligandos sigma-1 y los receptores opioides, o los farmacos opioides y los receptores sigma-1, que pudieran interferir en nuestros resultados, ya que los ligandos sigma-1 no desplazaron la union del radioligando µ [3H]DAMGO, y los farmacos opioides no desplazaron la union del radioligando sigma-1 [3H](+)pentazocina.\nLa aparente importancia del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica se vio respaldada por los resultados de expresion del receptor sigma-1 obtenidos mediante la tecnica de Western blot, que desvelaron una expresion del receptor sigma-1 de en torno a diez veces superior a nivel del sistema nervioso periferico (ganglios de la raiz dorsal) que a nivel central (medula espinal y diversos nucleos supraespinales).\nPese a que nuestros datos ilustran la gran importancia del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide, la hiperlocomocion y el estrenimiento inducidos por la administracion de opioides no se vieron alterados en ratones KO-sigma-1 o en WT tratados con antagonistas sigma-1. Conclusion\nConsiderando los resultados aqui resumidos, podemos concluir que la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1, tanto a nivel sistemico como local, incrementa la antinocicepcion opioide a nivel periferico frente a un estimulo mecanico, de lo que se deduce que el receptor sigma-1 es un freno biologico a la analgesia opioide periferica. Esta potenciacion de la analgesia opioide no conlleva un incremento de efectos no analgesicos centrales o perifericos (hiperlocomocion e inhibicion del transito intestinal, respectivamente) derivados de la administracion de opioides. Por lo tanto, el antagonismo sigma-1 podria tener relevancia clinica como adyuvante, a nivel sistemico o local, para incrementar la analgesia opioide sin incrementar los efectos adversos de los opioides.\n Referencias\nAl-Hasani R y Bruchas MR, Anesthesiology. 115:1363-1381 (2011).\nBrock C et al., Drugs. 72:1847-65 (2012).\nChristie MJet al., Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 27:520-523 (2000).\nCobos EJ et al., Curr Neuropharmacol. 6:344-366 (2008).\nDhingra L et al., Palliat Med. 27: 447-56 (2013).\nGallelli L et al., Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 66:37-144 (2010).\nHnasko TS et al., Nature. 438:854-857 (2005).\nHolzer P, Regul Pept. 155:11-7 (2009).\nKhalefa BI et al., Eur J Pain. 16:690-705 (2012).\nMarrazzo A et al., Life Sci. 78:449-53 (2006).\nMei J y Pasternak GW, J.

      "abstract": "Narcotics have been known to man since prehistoric times, and they continue to be among the most used analgesics in the practice of medicine. They comprise a group of drugs whose analgesic effect is coupled with euphoria and somnolence. In addition, their spasmogenic effect on smooth muscle has made them useful agents in the alleviation of certain gastrointestinal tract symptoms. For most narcotics, therapeutic dosage does not produce serious untoward effects. Unfortunately, they have a depressant effect on respiration by directly influencing the respiratory center of the brain. This may be life threatening when recommended dosages are exceeded. Narcotics have been abused since the recognition that they can induce euphoria and a feeling of well being. Tolerance and physical and psychological dependence result from their repeated use. The occurrence of withdrawal symptomatology in humans using these drugs repeatedly helps to produce a pattern of drug dependence; an individual has but to repeat a dose of drug in order to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Abuse liability is thus great. All narcotics share this addiction potential. Those most frequently prescribed in clinical medicine are morphine, trieperidine, codeine and methadone. Heroin (diacetylmorphine), the most commonly abused narcotic, available only illicitly, is not prescribed in clinical practice. After injection, it is hydrolyzed to morphine which produces its pharmacological action. While morphine and heroin are absorbed only following parenteral administration, some narcotics are absorbed readily from the gastrointestinal tract as well as after injection (methadone, codeine, meperidine). Regardless of the mode of administration, narcotics taken by a pregnant addict readily pass the placental barrier and are capable of producing effects on the infant in utero and after birth.",

We have recently identified mutations in the <i>MR-1</i> gene causing familial PNKD. <b>Methods: </b> We reviewed the clinical features of 14 kindreds with familial dyskinesia that was not clearly induced by movement or during sleep. Of these 14 kindreds, 8 had <i>MR-1</i> mutations and 6 did not. <b>Results: </b> Patients with PNKD with <i>MR-1</i> mutations had their attack onset in youth (infancy and early childhood). Typical attacks consisted of a mixture of chorea and dystonia in the limbs, face, and trunk, and typical attack duration lasted from 10 minutes to 1 hour. Caffeine, alcohol, and emotional stress were prominent precipitants. Attacks had a favorable response to benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam and diazepam. Attacks in families without <i>MR-1</i> mutations were more variable in their age at onset, precipitants, clinical features, and response to medications. Several were induced by persistent exercise. <b>Conclusions: </b> Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) should be strictly defined based on age at onset and ability to precipitate attacks with caffeine and alcohol. Patients with this clinical presentation (which is similar to the phenotype initially reported by Mount and Reback) are likely to harbor myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (<i>MR-1</i>) gene mutations. Other “PNKD-like” families exist, but atypical features suggests that these subjects are clinically distinct from PNKD and do not have <i>MR-1</i> mutations.

When a post-polio patient presents with new symptoms, it is first essential to identify and treat other medical and neurological conditions which could produce these symptoms. New weakness can be managed with exercise (stretching, strengthening, and aerobic), avoidance of muscular overuse, weight loss, orthoses, and assistive devices. Fatigue can be managed with energy conservation techniques, lifestyle changes, pacing, regular rest periods or naps during the day, amitriptyline to improve sleep, and possibly pyridostigmine (trial in progress). The management of pain is dependent upon its cause. The treatment of post-polio muscular pain can include activity reduction, pacing (rest periods during activity), moist heat, ice, and stretching, use of assistive devices, and life style modifications. Fibromylagia can be treated with amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, and aerobic exercise. Joint and soft tissue abnormalities can be managed with modification of extremity use, physiotherapy, orthoses, assistive devices, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and rarely steroid injections and surgery. Superimposed neurological disorders may produce pain, and should be identified and treated. The identification and treatment of pulmonary dysfunction in a post-polio patient is an important aspect of management, and is discussed elsewhere in this issue. Dysphagia can be managed with diet changes, use of special breathing and swallowing techniques, monitoring fatigue and taking larger meals earlier and smaller meals later, and avoiding eating when fatigued. The management of psychosocial difficulties usually requires an interdisciplinary approach, and may include a post-polio support group, social worker, psychologist, and psychiatrist.",

      "title": "Melatonin for Sundown Syndrome and Delirium in Dementia: Is It Effective?",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The terms \"sundown syndrome\" or \"sundowning\" are used to describe a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in individuals with dementia in the late afternoon, evening, or night.1 These symptoms include confusion, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, aggression, pacing, wandering, screaming, yelling, and hallucinations. The treatment of sundown syndrome is challenging, and pharmacological therapies are not particularly effective. An 81-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed 4 years previously was admitted to the elderly department because of behavioral disturbances, sleep disorders, and wandering. His wife said that his cognitive and functional impairments had gradually worsened over the past 4 years and that, in the last 6 months, her husband had become verbally aggressive, agitated, and restless; wandered; and paced. He did not sleep for long and had difficulty falling asleep. The symptoms increased in the late afternoon and at night. He had no hallucinations or delusions. One month before admission, delirium was suspected, and his general practitioner prescribed haloperidol, but it was not effective. Physical and neurological examination showed no abnormalities. He scored 8 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (indicating severe cognitive impairment) and 50 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (indicating severe behavioral disturbances). Blood and urine test results were normal. During admission, sundown syndrome was diagnosed, and he received pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for behavioral and sleep disturbances, but none was effective, and some aggravated symptoms. The pharmacological interventions consisted of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants, all given in an optimal dosing schedule. After extensive review of his history, the effect of past treatments, and the published literature, melatonin was started at a dose of 2 mg at 8:00 p.m. for sleep disorders. Not only did his sleep quality improve within a week, but there was also significant improvement in his behavior within 2 hours of initiation of melatonin. A therapeutic trial with an additional dose of 2 mg given at 3:00 p.m. was started, and his symptoms gradually improved over the subsequent 2 weeks (NPI score 20). No behavioral changes were observed in the 2-month follow-up. The prevalence of sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia is estimated to be 2.4% to 66%.1 This wide variation is primarily due to the numerous definitions of the disorder. Several studies have reported that the circadian rhythm, which melatonin regulates, may be an important factor contributing to sundown syndrome.2, 3 Melatonin secretion is low or dysregulated in individuals with dementia, with levels of melatonin detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of controls being almost five times as high as those in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.3, 4 In addition, previous randomized controlled trials and case series have found that melatonin significantly improves sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia.5-7 All of these studies had some limitations, such as different definitions of sundown syndrome, small sample size, different settings (home, hospital), and various dosages of melatonin. One study reported that melatonin (n = 24; placebo, n = 17) did not significantly affect sleep, circadian rhythms, or agitation in individuals with dementia.8 It is important to differentiate sundown syndrome from delirium because of differences in treatment and prognosis. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of changes in cognition and behavior, a fluctuating course during the day, and an altered level of consciousness.9 In general, it can be caused by a medical condition, drug or substance intoxication, or withdrawal.9 Delirium may gradually improve as the primary problem resolves or the medical condition becomes stable. Sundown syndrome is characterized by a rapid onset or exacerbation of the usual behaviors that occur every day at the same time, in the late afternoon, evening, or night. Although it has been suggested that physiological and environmental factors contribute to the development of this syndrome, no cause is typically found in most individuals.1 The pharmacological interventions for delirium are better documented than those for sundown syndrome. Sundown syndrome and delirium share many symptoms, but it is not known whether they share the same pathophysiological mechanisms, although the circadian rhythm pathway is implicated in both conditions.2, 3, 10 It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion is associated with postoperative delirium in elderly adults,10 but only two articles were found on the efficacy of melatonin as treatment for delirium in the literature.11, 12 The first reported two cases;11 one was a 53-year-old man successfully treated with melatonin for severe postoperative delirium unresponsive to antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, and the second was a 78-year-old man with a history of postoperative delirium who was given melatonin to prevent another episode of postoperative delirium. He did not develop postoperative delirium on melatonin. The second article reported that low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg/d) given every night for 14 days or until discharge was associated with lower risk of delirium than placebo in elderly adults (n = 72; mean age 84.5).12 Further adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of melatonin in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. Until then, melatonin could be considered a treatment option, especially in individuals who fail to respond to other interventions.

      "abstract": "A broad spectrum of pathological gamblers (N = 222) were queried with regard to physical symptoms when attempting to slow down or stop gambling. Results were compared with a control group of substance‐dependent patients who gambled at least casually. Sixty‐five percent of the pathological gamblers (vs. only 2% of controls) experienced at least one of the following: insomnia (50%), headaches (36%), upset stomach or diarrhea (34%), loss of appetite (29%), physical weakness (27%), heart racing or palpitations (26%), shaking (19%), muscle aches or cramps (17%), difficulty breathing (13%), sweating (12%), and chills or fever (6.5%). In addition, 91% experienced “cravings'and 87% felt “restless and irritable'when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Contrary to expectations, none of the symptoms correlated with gender, type of gambling, extent of alcohol or drug use while gambling, or self‐described alcoholism or drug addiction. Symptoms did correlate with number of hours spent gambling, severity of the problem as measured by proposed DSM‐IV criteria, and presence of dissociation.",

      "abstract": "The range of drugs available to provide anesthesia for patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is ever increasing. Initially, anesthetic agents were selected on the basis of their capacity not to antagonize the induced seizure. This was not always a simple task because almost all general anesthetic agents have \"in built\" antiepileptic activity. Nonbarbiturate agents such as propofol have been successfully used as alternatives to thiopental and methohexitone, but this drug too has antiepileptic properties. Most recently, opioid-like drugs such as remifentanil have been used, and there has been renewed interest in ketamine, a phencyclidine derivative. Attention has also focused on whether the anesthetic agent selected may affect the cognitive impairment seen after ECT. Studies in this area are limited, but early results suggest that agents such as ketamine may have particular benefit. This article reviews the current literature dealing with anesthesia and postoperative cognitive impairment in general and with regard to ECT in particular.",

In some cases, it is an adverse event of antipsychotic medications. Materials and methods An Internet search was initiated using the search engines: Direct Sciences; Medline and keywords “Penile erection; priapism; Antipsychotic agents; Side effects” and we illustrated our literature review by a clinical vignette of a man aged 38 years followed for schizophrenia placed under Fluphenazine 125 mg/month from 5 years who consulted us in may 2015 because of priapism and he described painful and prolonged erection episodes evolving for approximately 5 days. Discussion Medical literature mentions many cases of venous priapism in patients treated by conventional or atypical neuroleptics. About 30% of venous priapisms could be related to drugs of which approximately 50% to neuroleptics. This side effect is related to alpha1-adrenergic blocking properties of these treatments, more or less important depending on the drugs in this class. After emergency treatment, the priapism is the problem of the continued neuroleptic treatment. The substitution of one molecule by another alpha-1 blocking properties to the less marked is recommended.

      "title": "Baby Jerking: A Teaching Video‐Recorded Case of Febrile Myoclonus",
      "abstract": "Myoclonus was first described by Friedreich in 1881: It is a sudden, brief, shock-like involuntary movement caused by muscle contraction (positive myoclonus) or atonia (negative myoclonus), often called \"jerk,\" \"shake,\" or \"spasm\" by patients and inexpert observers. Depending on the distribution, myoclonus can be focal, multifocal, segmental, or generalized. Myoclonic jerks can be isolated or in cluster, rhythmic or arrhythmic, occur at rest (spontaneous), be triggered by stimuli (reflex), or induced by voluntary movement (action).1 Marsden et al. first classified myoclonus in four categories on the base of clinical presentation and aetiology: physiological, essential, epileptic, and symptomatic myoclonus. Alternatively, neurophysiological features associated with the neuroanatomical source of myoclonus can be used to differentiate cortical, cortical-subcortical, subcortical-nonsegmental, segmental, and peripheral myoclonus.1 Febrile myoclonus (FM) was described for the first time in 1960,2 but its importance has increased only in the recent decades. FM is a benign disorder characterized by the appearance of myoclonic jerks during fever, with resolution of myoclonus upon defervescence. Sometimes, similar myoclonic jerks can occur also after an infectious event, and for these cases the more appropriate term of \"parainfectious myoclonic jerks\" has been introduced by Bathia et al.3 and recently recovered by Delucchi et al.4 In most cases, FM occurs in the same age range as febrile seizures (6 months–6 years). Only a few cases of FM are reported in the literature.5-8 All researchers agree that this condition is relatively frequent, but under-recognized. We add a new case of FM to the pertinent literature and report, for the first time, on a video showing FM attacks in order to improve the knowledge about this disorder among child neurologists and pediatricians and facilitate its recognition. An 11-month-old boy was brought to our emergency room by his parents because of the abrupt appearance of sudden, brief body jerks occurring every 3 to 4 minutes throughout the previous hour. His family history was negative for movement disorders and seizures, and the child presented a normal neurological development and had no past history of neurological illness. The child had a cold for the previous 2 days and a fever for the preceding 12 hours. At admission, his body temperature was 39.6°C. The clinical and neurological examination was normal, except for upper airway inflammation. There were no signs of meningeal irritation. During the observation, the child was sitting with extended lower limbs. Repetitive abrupt, brief jerks involving the four limbs were observed, with violent extension and sometimes abduction of the limbs, occasionally associated with axial retropulsion. Sometimes the jerks occurred in a cluster, with a bigger initial jerk, possibly more tonic, followed by close rhythmic jerks with fading intensity. There were no obvious triggers, such as sudden noises, or tactile or painful stimuli. If holding an object at the onset of an episode, the boy would fist his hand, whereas he would open and extend it if free, suggesting a prevalent proximal involvement. The child looked alert, but frightened, during the events, and cried afterward (see Video 1; written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents for the publication of this video). The child was admitted to the pediatric neurology department for further investigations. Routine blood tests revealed mild neutrophilic leukocytosis and the urine test was negative, suggesting an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). During hospitalization, he experienced two other brief clusters of two to three jerks during wakefulness as well as during sleep, respectively, with a body temperature of 37.5°C and 38.6°C. After administration of ibuprofen, body temperature dropped and myoclonic jerks completely disappeared. A 24-hour video EEG monitoring performed subsequently showed normal background activity in wakefulness and sleep without any epileptic abnormalities and discharges. No episodes were recorded. The URTI did not require antibiotic therapy, and the baby fully recovered within 2 days with antipyretics. He has remained well over a 24-month follow-up: No neurological deficits, seizures, or psychomotor developmental delay have been observed. Therefore, on the basis of published descriptions of similar fits in infancy,2, 9 the diagnosis of FM was formulated. The clinical picture of our patient shows significant similarities to previously reported cases of FM.5-8The analysis of the video that we provide will possibly help the diagnosis of FM be easier and more straightforward to make for clinicians. Although the first 5 cases of myoclonus associated with fever were described in 1960,2 only 25 patients have been reported in the English literature thus far, none with video documentation of the spells.5-8 Most likely, FM occurs more frequently than reported, and, at presentation, its distinction from other conditions (such as Fejerman syndrome, epileptic spasms, epileptic myoclonus, or other symptomatic myoclonus9, 10) may be challenging for general pediatricians. As far as our patient is concerned, the absence of a history suggestive of remote or recent brain injury, along with the normal neurological development and exam, make the diagnosis of symptomatic myoclonus extremely unlikely.9 Moreover, the normal EEG background activity and the absence of photosensitivity, as well as jerks induced by tactile or acoustic stimuli, allow us to rule out also the diagnosis of epilepsy, such as benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and infantile spasms. Furthermore, the distinctive occurrence of myoclonic jerks only during fever makes the diagnosis of benign myoclonus of early infancy (Fejerman syndrome),9 shaking body attacks, or other paroxysmal nonepileptic phenomena11 unlikely; indeed, these conditions share some clinical aspects with FM, but have not been related to fever. The clinical features of FM may be summarized as follows: (1) sudden onset of generalized/segmental myoclonus; (2) presence of fever; (3) presentation between 6 months and 6 years of age; (4) nonprogressive course and absence of other additional signs or symptoms; (5) absence of possible causes for secondary myoclonus (hypoxia, metabolic disorders, drug intoxication, storage disease, or neurodegenerative disorders); (6) absence of central nervous system infection; and (7) recovery with cessation of the febrile event in a child with otherwise normal neurological development and physical examination. Even though the etiopathogenesis remains unknown,5, 8 the febrile myoclonic jerks in these children do not seem to be related to cortical epileptic discharges.5, 12 Some researchers suggest a brainstem origin of myoclonus.7 The diagnosis is based on careful clinical evaluation. Extensive investigations, such as brain MRI and lumbar puncture, are not necessary for this diagnosis; video EEG polygraphy recordings can be useful to show normal background activity and rule out the epileptic nature of the jerks; benign long-term outcome offers further support to the diagnosis of FM. No therapy is required. By publishing, for the first time, a suggestive video recording of FM, we draw attention to the importance of increasing the knowledge about this disorder among child neurologists and pediatricians, in order to facilitate its recognition, avoiding misdiagnosis and unwarranted treatment as well as allowing reassurance of parents and caregivers.

      "abstract": "(1) Fibromyalgia is characterised by a range of symptoms that include muscle pain, fatigue and sleep disorders. Anxiety and depression are often also present. The cause is unknown. More women than men are affected; (2) The following review focuses on differential diagnoses and available treatments for fibromyalgia, based on a review of the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology; (3) Fibromyalgia is mainly diagnosed by excluding other possibilities. The principal differential diagnoses are rheumatic involvement of the spine, systemic inflammatory disorders, and hypothyroidism. Unlike these other conditions, fibromyalgia is not associated with radiological or laboratory abnormalities; (4) Paracetamol has not been compared with other treatments in fibromyalgia. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have no specific effect; (5) The only two trials assessing tramadol showed little effect; in one study the average pain score was 53 mm in the tramadol group versus 65 mm in the placebo group, on a scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm. The adverse effects of tramadol are those of opiates in general, mainly nausea and dependence. Tramadol interacts with numerous other drugs; (6) The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants is also difficult to quantify. Their limited superiority over placebo lasts no more than a few months. The efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine and citalopram), serotonin and nonadrenaline reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine and milnacipran) is even less well established. Duloxetine has been tested in four placebo-controlled trials with unconvincing results; (7) Pregabalin and gabapentin, two antiepileptic drugs, appear to be more effective than placebo but have only been tested in short-term trials. In one trial 44% of patients in the pregabalin group said they felt better after 13 weeks versus 35% of patients in the placebo group. However, adverse effects are frequent and sometimes troublesome (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, weight gain). In clinical trials, 19% to 33% of patients stopped treatment due to adverse effects after 13 weeks, depending on the dose of pregabalin; (8) Assessments of non-drug treatments in this setting are generally mediocre. The best-assessed alternative therapies (acupuncture and physical exercise) only have a limited effect; (9) In practice, when a patient presents with symptoms compatible with fibromyalgia, the first step is to rule out a treatable condition. Quality of life may be improved by first acknowledging that the pain is real, and possibly by providing psychological, medical, social and occupational support. The limited efficacy of available drugs, and their potential adverse effects, should be discussed with the patient.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Depression may arise as a result of other mental or physical problems or as a side effect of the drugs used to treat such illnesses, or it could be caused by epilepsy-related structural abnormalities. However, physicians are hesitant to prescribe antidepressants to patients with epilepsy due to concerns about decreasing seizure thresholds and the harmful drug interactions between antidepressants and antiepileptic medicines. As a result, the question about the optimal care of epileptic patients who suffer from depression remains unanswered. Despite the complicated link between epilepsy and depression, the co-administration of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is safe and beneficial when appropriately managed. A focused evaluation for depression (regardless of social, economic, or personal circumstances) might identify people who benefit from medical care and therapeutic assistance. Vagus nerve stimulation and psychological therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, individual or group psychotherapy, patient support groups, family therapy, and counseling are nonpharmacological therapeutic alternatives. In terms of treatment strategy, it is critical to optimize seizure control and limit antiepileptic medications' adverse effects. Psychotherapy for depression in epilepsy is underused, even though it has been shown to be helpful in well-controlled studies. This review article has discussed some parts of the most common pathophysiologies of depression in patients with epilepsy, highlighted the efficacy of psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs, and explored the optimal care of patients with epilepsy who suffer from depression.",

The purpose in removing symptoms may include trying to prevent suicide, restoring work and interpersonal function, or enhancing the patient's capacity to participate in psychotherapy.

TDCS may potentially negatively affect mood in specific individuals with fibromyalgia. Abstract Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive neuromodulator that showed promising results in pain reduction among individuals with fibromyalgia (FM). Despite the potential benefits, it may have some adverse events that are mainly transient. However, long‐lasting effects can also occur. We presented a 31‐year‐old man whose symptoms and signs were consistent with fibromyalgia, and he received tDCS over C3 to reduce diffuse pain.

      "abstract": "Chronic pain causes a tremendous burden on the society in terms of economic factors and social costs. Rates of spinal surgery, especially spinal fusion, have increased exponentially over the past decade. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been one response to the management of pain, but it has been fraught with numerous catastrophic-related adverse effects. Clinically, spinal cord stimulation (SCS)/neuromodulation has been used in the management of chronic pain (especially spine-related pain) for more than two decades. More recent advances in this field have led to new theories and approaches in which SCS can be used in the management of chronic spine-related pain with precision and efficacy while minimizing adverse effects commonly seen with other forms of chronic pain treatment (eg, narcotics, injections, ablations). Narcotic medications have adverse effects of habituation, nausea, constipation, and the like. Injections sometimes lack efficacy and can have only limited duration of efficacy. Also, they can have adverse effects of cerebrospinal fluid leak, infection, and so on. Ablations can be associated with burning discomfort, lack of efficacy, recurrent symptoms, and infection. High-frequency stimulation, burst stimulation, tonic stimulation with broader paddles, and new stimulation targets such as the dorsal root ganglion hold promise for improved pain management via neuromodulation moving forward. Although a significant rate of complications with SCS technology are well described, this can be a useful tool in the management of chronic spine-related pain.",

This review gives an overview of the current understanding of cataplexy and its available treatment options. Recent findings With the discovery of hypocretin/orexin, the understanding of the pathophysiology of cataplexy advanced in the past decades. In the recent years, with the development of new anticataplectic agents (e.g., Pitolisant) symptomatic treatment of cataplexy has further improved. Abrupt cessation of anticataplectic medication especially antidepressants increase the risk of status cataplecticus, a virtually continuous series of long-lasting cataplectic attacks. Summary Cataplexies still remain an under-recognized phenomenon due to missing diagnostic measures. Treatment for cataplexy still remains symptomatic but new agents with better tolerability and usability are continuously developed. New therapeutic actions either targeting the autoimmune mechanisms underlying orexin cell death or substituting orexin action are promising treatments for the near future.",

      "abstract": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a common emergency condition in paediatric practice. Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

      "abstract": "Spasticity is a source of disability for the hemiplegic patient. It leads to various disorders influencing the quality of gait: at the lower limb varus equinus foot deformity, toe-claw and/or hip adduction with adductors spasticity. At the upper limb, flexion deformity of the wrist and the hand makes grasp and grip ineffective and spasticity of the Pectoralis Major muscle is considered as a main cause of sympathetic dystrophy. Neurolysis with alcohol injection in the nerve trunk or at the motor point destroys the gamma fibers and reduces spasticity, without impairing motor command. The effects on spasticity, motricity, and deformity of 33 chemical neurolysis with alcohol are analysed with a six months follow-up (27 hemiplegic patients, 28 to 62 years old, mean = 54.5). The authors have used 60% alcohol concentration. Sciatic nerve injection significantly reduces triceps spasticity (7/11), improves the range motion of the ankle, and allows the patient to take off the ankle device. Those fair results are still present at the fourth month after injection. Similar results are reported after injection of the obturator nerve for hip adduction deformity (2/3), median nerve injection for wrist and hand deformity (6/6). Pectoralis Major injection in the motor point is effective for 10 of the 13 cases, preventing sympathetic reflex dystrophy or contributing to its dramatic improvement.",

      "abstract": "The development and selection of optimal outcome measures is increasingly recognized as a key component of evidence-based medicine, particularly the need for the development of a standardized set of measures for use in clinical trials. This process is particularly complex for functional neurological disorder (FND) for several reasons. FND can present with a wide range of symptoms that resemble the full spectrum of other neurological disorders. Additional physical (e.g., pain, fatigue) and psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety) symptoms are commonly associated with FND, which also can be highly disabling with implications for prognosis, and warrant concurrent assessment, despite an unclear etiological relationship with FND. Furthermore, several unique clinical aspects of FND make it likely that the usual prioritization of \"objective\" (or clinician-rated) over \"subjective\" (or patient-rated) measures might not be appropriate. Self-report measures may be more clinically meaningful in this patient population. Despite being a common and disabling disorder, there has been little research into outcome measures in FND, and to date trials have largely used measures designed for the assessment of other disorders. An international FND Core Outcome Measure group (FND-COM) has been established to develop a consensus battery of outcomes for FND: a \"core outcome set.\" In this perspective article, the authors reviewed the process of outcome measure development and selection before considering the specific features of FND affecting the development of a core outcome set, as well as a research agenda to optimize outcome measurement in this complex neuropsychiatric disorder.",

In some cases, peripheral neuropathic pain may occur due to a lesion or disease of the peripheral somatosensory nervous system. Efficacy of different agents for peripheral neuropathic pain conditions is less than optimal. The administration of topical analgesics might be an option, due to the potential of reduced adverse effects and increased patient compliance. There is major interest in compounding topical analgesics for peripheral neuropathic pain, but several challenges remain for this approach. Topical analgesics have the potential to be a valuable additional approach for the management of peripheral neuropathic pain. Topical amitriptyline-ketamine combination (AK) is a promising agent for peripheral neuropathic pain conditions. Some studies have shown its efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions. However, this data was not uniformely obtained and its role remains still controversial. Efficacy may depend on many factors, including the choice of the vehicle, the concentration, the pain site, and specific diseases. More studies are necessary to support the use of AK in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Pregabalin is a novel isomer of gamma-aminobutyric acid that functions as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is used daily in medical practice for treating neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, and partial seizures. Due to its anti-glutamatergic effects, it poses a potential addiction risk. For example, an abrupt discontinuation of this substance may cause patients to exhibit physical withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, headache, and diarrhoea. However, there is no information in the literature that addresses whether the rapid discontinuation of pregabalin can cause psychosis to occur. Here we presented a 20-year-old patient with his first episode of psychosis that was likely attributable to his withdrawal from a high dosage pregabalin. He lacked physical signs of withdrawal; however, a psychiatric examination was conducted. It was determined that the patient was experiencing paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, and mutism. Furthermore, he had engaged in self-mutilative actions and had attempted suicide. Due to the short time frame between the rapid discontinuation of a relatively large dose of pregabalin and the onset of the patient's first episode of psychosis, it is likely that the psychotic episode was triggered by the cessation of the medication. This is the first known case of psychosis that was caused by the rapid withdrawal of pregabalin to be discussed in the literature. The results of this clinical case may guide clinicians to recognize the symptoms of acute pregabalin withdrawal.",

Acute dyskinesias are usually self-limiting, whereas tardive dyskinesias are persistent after stopping the including drugs. At least three distinct tardive syndromes can be differentiated on phenomenological grounds: classical orobuccolingual dyskinesia, tardive dystonia and tardive akathisia. The emergence of a tardive syndrome should prompt discontinuation of the offending drug or switching to clozapine. The management of tardive syndromes is still difficult. Tetrabenazine is the drug most often suggested in the international literature as treatment of choice despite its considerable side effects.

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant problem that may affect individuals who have been exposed to a traumatic event or events, including combat, violent crime or childhood abuse. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be significantly involved in emotional adjustment, particularly introspection, amygdala inhibition and emotional memory. In the acute phase of severe traumatic stress, the mPFC appears to undergo a change in plasticity for a short time, which suggests that the mPFC may be the reponse-sensitizing region. Calcium (Ca2+) is one of most significant intracellular messengers; the appropriate concentration of Ca2+ is necessary for neuronal excitability. When the Ca2+ concentration increases, Ca2+, calmodulin (CaM) and CaM kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) combine together to form the Ca2+‑CaM‑CaMKIIα signaling pathway, which is important in the plasticity of the central nervous system, learning and memory, mind, behavior and other types of cognitive activities. Our team studied the changes in the Ca2+-CaM-CaMKIIα levels in the mPFC of rats following a single-prolonged stress (SPS). The SPS, a credible method for establishing a rat model of PTSD, has been internationally recognized. The free intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the mPFC in the PTSD group was significantly higher than that in the control group 1 day after SPS exposure (P<0.05) and decreased 7 days after SPS; CaM expression significantly increased, while CaMKIIα expression significantly decreased in the mPFC 1 day after SPS compared with the control group. These findings suggest dysfunction of the Ca2+-CaM-CaMKIIα cascades in the mPFC, which may relate to the pathogenesis of the abnormal functioning of the mPFC in PTSD.",

This has been emphasized in the last epidemiologic studies performed with an identical methodology in our industrialized countries.

The first is represented by cerebrovascular diseases, but cerebral involution--per se--is surely involved. Prescription of antiepileptic drugs in these patients has to be adapted to the individual cautiously. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic variations are more frequent than in other populations. On the other hand, drug interactions seem to be more frequent and severe because of the polytherapy prescribed for multiple other diseases.

It is probable that the coronary X syndrome is frequently conditioned by the hormonal-metabolic X syndrome. The pathogenetic dilemma is that it is not clear why in microvascular angina pectoris the coronary circulation does not possess an adequate reserve for vasodilatation during exercise or in response to some pharmacological stimuli. This could condition hyperinsulinism in hypertonic subjects with NIDDM with an early disorder of paracrine endothelial relaxation mechanisms (EDRF-NO), with a predominance of vasoconstrictor mechanisms (endothelin-1). In Reaven's syndrome X it is not clear whether insulin resistance of the postreceptor type is a primary inborn phenomenon which is compensated by insulin hypersecretion or whether it is a secondary phenomenon, which develops ex post and by which the target tissues defend themselves against an excessive effect of insulin (e.g. down regulation receptors) in primary disorders of its secretion.",

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency condition with continuous seizure activity that lasts at least 5 min and causes profound neuronal damage, morbidity, or death. SE incidents can arise spontaneously, but mostly are elicited by seizurogenic triggers. Chemoconvulsants such as the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine and organophosphates (OP) such as the pesticide diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and the nerve agent soman can induce persistent seizures and SE. Pilocarpine, DFP, and soman share a common feature of cholinergic crisis that transitions into a state of refractory SE, but their comparative profiles remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the comparative convulsant profile of pilocarpine, DFP, and soman to produce refractory SE and brain damage in rats. Behavioral and electrographic seizures were monitored after agent exposure and the extent of brain injury was determined by histological markers of neuronal injury and degeneration. Seizures were elicited about 10-15 min slower after pilocarpine as compared to DFP or soman, which caused rapid onset of spiking at 8-10 min after challenges that swiftly developed into persistent SE lasting for hours. Time-course of SE activity after DFP was comparable to that after soman, a potent neurotoxic chemical agent. Diazepam controlled pilocarpine-induced SE, but it was ineffective in reducing DFP- and soman-induced SE. All three agents produced 35-45% neuronal injury and neurodegeneration in the brain. These results reveal distinct convulsant and neuronal injury patterns following exposure to cholinergic agonists, OP pesticides, and nerve agents. A battery of SE models is essential to identify novel anticonvulsants or combination therapies that can effectively control refractory SE.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are often accompanied by chronic painful symptoms. Examples of such symptoms are backache, headache, gastrointestinal pain, and joint pain. In addition, pain generally not associated with major depression or an anxiety disorder, such as peripheral neuropathic pain (e.g., diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia), cancer pain, and fibromyalgia, can be challenging for primary care providers to treat. Antidepressants that block reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, such as the tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline), have been used to treat pain syndromes in patients with or without comorbid MDD or GAD. Venlafaxine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has been safe and effective in animal models, healthy human volunteers, and patients for treatment of various pain syndromes. The use of venlafaxine for treatment of pain associated with MDD or GAD, neuropathic pain, headache, fibromyalgia, and postmastectomy pain syndrome is reviewed. Currently, no anti‐depressants, including venlafaxine, are approved for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes. Additional randomized, controlled trials are necessary to fully elucidate the role of venlafaxine in the treatment of chronic pain.",

Some of those movement disorders were difficult to treat, and they sometimes persisted after cessation of the antipsychotic treatment (Druckman, Seelinger, & Thulin, 1962). The resulting persistent syndrome, consisting of repetitive oral-buccal-lingual movements (chewing movements; lip puckering, sucking, or smacking; tongue protrusions; side-to-side jaw deviations), was referred to as tardive dyskinesia, and later as classic tardive dyskinesia (Fahn, 1985). The oral-buccal-lingual movements, sometimes accompanied by repetitive limb movements, were labeled “tardive” because they generally appeared only after prolonged treatment with antipsychotics (Faurbye et al., 1964), though there were some reports of persistent movements appearing soon after initiation of therapy (Angle & Mclntire, 1968).",

      "abstract": "Aims & Objectives: Pain refractory to properly titrated multimodal analgesics, and other difficult-to-control distressing symptoms may occur in the PICU, usually in children with advanced cancer causing malignant effusions, obstruction or osseous metastases, and in children with sequelae of neurologic disorders. This may constitute a barrier to transfer to other healthcare settings. Methods Methods: A literature search was performed utilizing the PubMed engine through January of 2018, querying terms relevant to refractory symptoms in critically-ill patients. Results There is an emerging body of experience in critical care. Impeccable assessment, appropriate integration of pharmacologic (non-opioid, opioid and adjuvant medications) and non-pharmacologic (integrative) measures consistent with WHO guidelines are key. Inadequate perioperative analgesia may precipitate refractory pain and dystonia. Delirium, opioid-associated neurotoxicity and hyperalgesia should be considered when escalating pain is encountered. Titratable intravenous agents may be effective. Dexmedetomidine, along with environmental measures, may mitigate delirium. This agent, Ketamine and lidocaine can be transitioned to enteral formulations or analogs, facilitating transfer. Medications (dexamethasone, octreotide) and Interventions to vent, stent and decompress may palliate malignant effusions or obstruction. Neuroaxial (epidural, intrathecal) techniques using opioids, adjuvants or ziconotide may be appropriate. Recently described image-guided percutaneous neuroablative procedures (myelotomy, cordotomy) appear to be safe and effective. Respite (overnight) or intermittent (hours / days) sedation can be attempted in selected patients prior to institution of traditional unidirectional, continuous palliative sedation. Conclusions A structured, multidisciplinary, individualized approach to care may achieve rapid control of complex symptoms, facilitating transfer from PICU to other inpatient or hospice settings.",

In rare cases, serious exacerbation of myocardial ischemia (β-blockers) or hypertension (clonidine, methyldopa) may occur in the posttreatment period.

      "abstract": "The neuroleptics are characterised by the large number of pharmacological effects they develop. When they are associated with other substances, it is frequent for the latter to have with neuroleptics one or several common sites of action. At this level, they develop phenomena of drug interaction, for example, synergy with depressors of the central nervous system or, in the periphery, with alpha-adrenolytic or parasympatholytic drugs. This type of interaction is used in anesthesia to obtain more intense effects with lesser doses of each component and also avoid the toxic effects of efficacious doses of general anesthetics used alone. However, although certain interactions are useful, others may prove harmful. This is in particular the case where neuroleptic drugs are administered after ingestion of alcohol. Various mechanisms, central and peripheral, explain the marked depression of the central nervous system which results. Potentialisation of the effects of tricyclic antidepressor drugs by neuroleptics raises a difficult problem for the anesthetist, the elimination of tricyclic antidepressor drugs is slow and requires several weeks after stopping treatment. During this period, the tissue and plasma concentrations become reduced gradually. They are pharmacologically insufficient, but are potentialised by injection of neuroleptic drugs, and may become active again, and even toxic. It seems to us advisable to avoid the use of neuroleptic drugs in patients treated with tricyclic antidepressor drugs and, if necessary, to use another method of anesthesia.",

Results: A 44-year-old woman with borderline personality traits and severe drug dependence developed a protracted drug-induced psychosis related to chronic high-dose crystalline methamphetamine use. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred with antipsychotic medication and abstinence from methamphetamine. Rapid recurrence of symptoms occurred at a time of high stress associated with minimal methamphetamine use and cessation of low-dose quetiapine. Symptoms rapidly resolved with abstinence, quetiapine and reduction of stressors. Conclusions: A drug-induced psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia can occur with repeated or high-dose use of methamphetamine. While this generally resolves rapidly with cessation of stimulant use, some cases of protracted drug-induced psychosis in vulnerable individuals have been documented. Behavioural sensitization can also occur, and neuroleptics may prevent the recurrence of further psychosis triggered by ongoing low-dose methamphetamine use.",

      "title": "APPLICATION OF REFLEXOTHERAPY ACCORDING TO THE \"HEXAGRAM BALANCING\" METHOD FOR CEPHALALGIAS OF THE TEMPORAL REGION",
      "abstract": "The article is devoted to one of the most urgent problems of neurology – cephalgias. Often, various diseases, especially those that occur with a pain syndrome, and those that are aggravated under the influence of psycho-emotional stress and other adverse psychosocial factors, are accompanied by long-term symptoms. Medicinal methods of treatment are not fully effective, so non-medicinal technologies should be resorted to. Complex treatment of cephalalgia of the temporal region using reflexotherapy methods has been used for a long time, not only for neurological diseases, but also for psychosomatic problems. Reflextherapy is shown here both due to its powerful anti-pain mechanisms and due to the fact that it is able to improve the emotional state. Endogenous opioid systems, neurotransmitters acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, substance P, inhibitory and excitatory amino acids, free radicals, neurotrophic factors, increased activity of Na+ channels, significant activation of microglia, dysfunction of the immune system, hypothalamo- pituitary-adrenal axis, disruption of neuroplasticity processes in the central nervous system. But, as is known, thanks to the normalization of these substances and regulatory influences, the mechanisms of therapeutic effects of acupuncture methods are provided. Endogenous opioid systems are closely related to pathological mechanisms in cephalgias, but, at the same time, they primarily form the mechanisms of acupuncture effects and are one of the most studied neurotransmitter systems in acupuncture research. The article presents the main theoretical principles of the \"balance of hexagrams\" method and its practical implementation. A clinical case is also presented: cephalic syndrome of the temporal region. The methods of acupuncture diagnosis are presented, the acupuncture diagnosis is characterized in detail, the description of acupuncture correction is given, the methods of medical correction used in treatment, the features of the \"favorable\" hexagram are considered. Thus, patients with cephalic syndrome of the temporal region are found in the practice of a neurologist and a reflexologist. In the complex of therapeutic measures for cephalic syndrome of the temporal region, the use of the acupuncture method \"balancing hexagrams\" can be effective. Purpose. To consider the features of the use of reflexology using the method of \"balancing hexagrams\" in the complex rehabilitation of a patient with cephalgia of the temporal region. Scientific novelty. For the first time in our country, the method of compiling acupuncture prescriptions and acupuncture using the method of \"balancing hexagrams\" was used in the complex rehabilitation of a patient with cephalgia of the temporal region. Methods. We consider one clinical case of the use of reflexology using the method of \"balancing hexagrams\" in the complex rehabilitation of a patient with cephalgia of the temporal region. The methods of clinical objective neurological examination, the method of syndromic diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine, the pulse diagnosis method, and the tongue diagnosis method were used. Results. As a result of treatment using the \"balancing hexagrams\" method, the patient's condition improved: the frequency and intensity of headaches decreased, and blood pressure spikes became less significant. Conclusions. 1. Patients with cephalic syndrome of the temporal region are found in the practice of a neurologist and a reflexologist. 2. In the complex of treatment measures for cephalic syndrome of the temporal region, the use of the acupuncture method \"balancing hexagrams\" can be effective.",

      "title": "Is Psychiatry in a Recession",
      "abstract": "During this economic recession, it feels as if the entire country is suffering from an adjustment disorder with anxiety and dysphoria. I don't want to depress you further, but doesn't it seem that psychiatry is having its own recession, reflected in our profession's collective psyche? Despite breathtaking discoveries in neuroscience, clinical advances are stalling because of a perfect storm of setbacks for our profession. For example: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * Second-generation atypical antipsychotics seem to be falling from grace after several effectiveness studies denigrated them for metabolic side effects and claimed they are not more efficacious than the older generation agents. Disillusionment followed. * Hopes for a new generation of glutamatergic antipsychotics were dashed when clinical trials failed to show that a novel metabotropic glutamate partial agonist was superior to placebo. * A palpable funk prevails as clinicians yearn for better antidepressants, with a more rapid onset of action, antisuicidal efficacy, and minimal side effects. The wait continues. * The media and idealistic crusaders criticize off-label prescribing, without knowing that 85% of psychiatric diagnoses in DSM-IV-TR have no approved medications. Because symptoms of many psychiatric disorders overlap, we try to relieve patients' suffering by prescribing medications that are FDA-approved for other indications. When it comes to off-label prescribing, it seems we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. * Relentless demonization of pharmaceutical companies has made them the whipping boy for corporate America. No wonder they are downsizing and investing less in drug research and development; the return on their investments has become unpredictable. No one else develops new psychiatric drugs, so our patients will suffer if the pharmaceutical slump worsens. * Academic researchers have been publicly tarred and feathered for collaborating with and advising pharmaceutical companies (such as in conducting FDA clinical trials) because they--like researchers in other fields--receive consulting income from those companies. This perception that any link with the evil pharmaceutical companies is a major sin has cast a pall over vital academic-industry collaborative research to develop new drug treatments for severe and disabling psychiatric disorders. * Even the American Psychiatric Association (APA) is under enormous stress. …",

      "abstract": "Although benzodiazepines are invaluable in the treatment of anxiety disorders, they have some potential for abuse and may cause dependence or addiction. It is important to distinguish between addiction to and normal physical dependence on benzodiazepines. Intentional abusers of benzodiazepines usually have other substance abuse problems. Benzodiazepines are usually a secondary drug of abuse-used mainly to augment the high received from another drug or to offset the adverse effects of other drugs. Few cases of addiction arise from legitimate use of benzodiazepines. Pharmacologic dependence, a predictable and natural adaptation of a body system long accustomed to the presence of a drug, may occur in patients taking therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. However, this dependence, which generally manifests itself in withdrawal symptoms upon the abrupt discontinuation of the medication, may be controlled and ended through dose tapering, medication switching, and/or medication augmentation. Due to the chronic nature of anxiety, long-term low-dose benzodiazepine treatment may be necessary for some patients; this continuation of treatment should not be considered abuse or addiction.",

      "title": "OxyContin® Abuse and Overdose",
      "abstract": "AbstractBackground: OxyContin® (controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride) (Purdue Pharma, Stamford, CT) was approved in 1995 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for moderate-to-severe chronic pain. Crushing and snorting the delayed-release tablets results in a rapid release of the drug, increased absorption, and high peak serum concentrations. The propensity for addiction to OxyContin® and the trend of increased prescription drug abuse have made it imperative for physicians and health care providers to recognize the clinical presentation of overdose and know how to manage associated complications. Objectives: In this review of OxyContin®, we discuss current trends in its abuse and the clinical presentation of overdose. We review the specific effects of the drug on body systems and the recognition of symptomatology, differential diagnosis, and management. Discussion: Many of the clinical findings in acute opioid overdoses are nonspecific, making diagnosis difficult. OxyContin® overdose presents with a typical opiate toxidrome, including decreased respirations, miosis, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. The presence of coingestants can cloud the clinical picture. If OxyContin® overdose is suspected, early ventilation and oxygenation should be administered, which is generally sufficient to prevent death. Even in the absence of a confirmation, cautious administration of naloxone–the opiate receptor antagonist and antidote for opioid overdoses–may have both diagnostic and therapeutic effects. Summary: With increasing rates of prescription drug abuse, OxyContin® will continue to present challenges to physicians and health care providers. Physicians should be aware of potential patients who are seeking OxyContin® for recreational use.Keywords: OxyContin®addictionsubstance abuseoverdoseopioid",

      "title": "Mechanistic basis of adverse drugreactions: the perils of inappropriate dose schedules",
      "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have long been recognised as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. They account for a substantial number of clinical consultations, hospital admissions and extended duration of in-patient stay as well as mortality. By far the most common ADRs are the concentration-dependent pharmacological reactions, the majority of which ought to be preventable. As a result of high concentrations of the parent drug and/or its metabolite(s), there is an augmentation of primary pharmacological activity and/or appearance of new and undesirable secondary pharmacological activity. Typically, these high concentrations result from administration of high doses in an attempt to maximise efficacy and/or modulation of the pharmacokinetics of a drug by either genetic or non-genetic factors. High plasma concentrations of parent drug may result from inherited impairment or drug-induced inhibition of its pharmacokinetic disposition. Conversely, inherited overcapacity or drug-induced induction of the metabolism of a drug may result in low concentrations of parent drug and frequently, rapid accumulation of its metabolites. Environmental, dietary and phytochemical factors may also influence the activity of drug metabolising enzymes. As with inherited polymorphisms of acetylation and cytochrome P450-based drug metabolising enzymes, polymorphisms of other conjugation reactions, such as glucuronidation, increasingly appear to be associated with drug toxicity. Diseases of organs involved in elimination of a drug also alter its pharmacokinetics, plasma concentration and, therefore, the profile of its concentration-dependent ADRs. Inherited mutations, concurrently administered drugs or presence of certain diseases may also alter the sensitivity of some pharmacological targets, accounting for a substantial number of ADRs and interactions. When there is enhanced pharmacodynamic sensitivity, plasma drug concentrations that are apparently within the normal 'non-toxic' range give rise to ADRs. Recent advances have also provided important insights into the wider scope of drug–drug interactions. Interactions that occur at P-glycoproteins, drug transporters and efflux pumps, at various transmembrane interfaces such as the gastrointestinal wall, renal tubules, hepatobiliary border and blood–brain barrier, are beginning to explain many non-metabolic interactions. These alter the systemic exposure to drugs and have so far, begun to explain unexpected neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. The function of these transporters is also genetically modulated. These advances, together with continued increased awareness and education of prescribers and pharmacists, offer great opportunities for substantially minimising concentration-related ADRs.",

      "title": "The Neurotoxicity of Drugs Given Intrathecally (Spinal)",
      "abstract": "A growing understanding of the neuropharmacology of spinal cord processing of nociceptive input has led to intense interest in the use of spinal drugs in anesthesia and pain management. The direct application of receptor-specific therapeutics at the spinal cord can potentially interrupt specific pain pathways and limit systemic side effects, but this practice also carries the inherent risk of injury to the central nervous system. Thus, the neurotoxicity of spinal drugs is a central safety issue. Spinal cord or nerve root toxicity may manifest itself as histologic, physiologic, or behavioral/clinical derangements after exposure to a spinal drug. Neurohistopathology is broadly classified as neural injury, gliosis, or damage to the myelin sheath, and it also describes inflammatory changes and involvement of the arachnoid cell layers. Physiologic neurotoxicity of spinal drugs includes changes in spinal cord blood flow, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and changes in the electrophysiology of impulse conduction. Behavioral and clinical signs of neurotoxicity include pain, motor and sensory deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Ideally, a complete roster of histological, physiologic, and behavioral testing would be performed on spinal drugs in several animal species, followed by safety trials in humans before widespread use. In practice, drugs have taken a variety of roads from conception to application, and often without safety data. In this article, we review available neurotoxicity data on drugs that have a clinical application, classified as spinal local anesthetics, spinal analgesics, or spinal adjuvants. Spinal Local Anesthetics The 100-yr history of spinal local anesthetic use in humans has typically involved self-experimentation, followed by widespread application with little or no controlled testing for neurotoxicity. Bier and Hildebrant [1] initially performed spinal anesthesia with cocaine on themselves in 1898, and essentially all of the earliest local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia were introduced in this fashion without toxicity studies. Despite a long history of clinical use, recent interest in neurotoxicity has arisen due to concerns over reports of cauda equina syndrome and transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) from spinal local anesthetics. We review animal data that have been used to assess the neurotoxicity of local anesthetics and summarize data available from human studies. In 1985, Ready et al. [2] evaluated the neurotoxic effects of single injections of local anesthetics in rabbits. They reported that spinal cord histopathology remained normal and that persistent neurologic deficits were not seen with clinically used concentrations of tetracaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, or chlorprocaine. However, histopathologic changes and neurologic deficits did occur with higher concentrations of tetracaine (1%) and lidocaine (8%). In this model, extensive neurologic impairment was not necessarily accompanied by equally extensive lesions in the spinal cord and nerve roots, thus demonstrating the need for multiple models to fully assess neurotoxicity. Recent studies have used desheathed peripheral nerve models, designed to mimic unprotected nerve roots in the cauda equina, to further assess electrophysiologic neurotoxicity of clinically relevant concentrations of local anesthetics [3-5]. These models demonstrate that clinically used concentrations of 5% lidocaine and 0.5% tetracaine cause irreversible conduction block, whereas 1.5% lidocaine, 0.75% bupivacaine, and 0.06% tetracaine do not. Electrophysiologic toxicity of lidocaine in these models is concentration-dependent (Figure 1) beginning at 40 mM (approximately 1%) with irreversible ablation of the compound action potential at 80 mM (approximately 2%). Kanai et al. [4] subsequently demonstrated that generation of action potentials was more vulnerable than maintenance of resting membrane potential and that irreversible ablation of action and resting membrane potential by lidocaine seems to be both concentration- and time-dependent.Figure 1: The nonreversible effect of 40 mM lidocaine on the compound action potential (CAP) of frog sciatic nerve. Lidocaine was applied to a stable nerve preparation for 15 min, then washed with frog Ringer's solution for 2 h. Tracings represent CAPs in response to stimuli (1-Hz stimulus = heavy line, 40-Hz stimulus = thin line). Lidocaine 40 mM completely ablated the CAP when applied to the nerve. The 1-Hz CAP response began to return after 10-15 min of washing and reached a new level in 45 min, where it was stable for the subsequent 2 h of observation. The recovered 1-Hz CAP is only 65% of the original. Reprinted with the publisher's permission from Holman SJ. Anesthesiology: hyperbaric dye solution distribution. Anesthesiology 1997;86:969.Effects of local anesthetics on spinal cord blood flow seem benign. Spinal administration of bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine causes vasodilation and increase spinal cord blood flow [6,7], whereas ropivacaine causes concentration-dependent vasoconstriction and reduction in spinal cord blood flow [6]. However, the effects of lidocaine on blood flow of in vitro peripheral nerve models are more concerning. Myers et al. [8] applied solutions of isotonic sodium chloride solution, 1% and 2% lidocaine with and without epinephrine, and epinephrine alone to isolated rat sciatic nerve and measured changes in blood flow with a laser Doppler flow probe. Blood flow was significantly depressed for all solutions except isotonic sodium chloride solution. Epinephrine by itself significantly reduced nerve blood flow, and, when added to local anesthetic solutions, it reduced blood flow to a greater extent than the reduction caused by local anesthetics alone. Although experimental studies in animals have provided ample evidence that some local anesthetics in clinically relevant concentrations can injure nerve tissue, the exact mechanisms of injury are unclear. Recent work on neuronal cell lines has attempted to determine the mechanism of local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Johnson and Uhl [9] have shown that direct application of 2.5%-5.0% lidocaine caused a >3-fold increase in intracellular calcium and up to a 20% incidence of cell death during 60 min of exposure in the neuronal cell line. They postulated that the mechanism of neurotoxicity was not likely from sodium channel blockade, because such a block would not lead to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium. Subsequent work in this model determined that 0.5% and 1.0% lidocaine, as well as 0.625% bupivacaine, lead to transient, moderate increases in calcium, probably from the endoplasmic reticulum, without cell death [10]. Thus, several different laboratory models have proven that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic but that lidocaine and tetracaine are potentially more neurotoxic than bupivacaine (Table 1).Table 1: Local Anesthetic ToxicityDespite the knowledge that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic in the laboratory model, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics in humans (Table 2). Retrospective [11], prospective [12], and historical studies [13-15] report 0%-0.7% incidence of postoperative neurologic injury in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Although lacking a denominator, information from closed-claims databases corroborate these findings [16,17]. Thus, the neurotoxic potential of spinally administered local anesthetics has not manifested itself in large-scale studies.Table 2: Large Epidemiologic Studies of the Neurologic Complications of Spinal AnesthesiaThere are few nonepidemiologic clinical studies evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of local anesthetics, and all have focused on electrophysiologic variables after spinal anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials, monosynaptic H-reflex [18], and cutaneous current perception thresholds [19] have been used to evaluate recovery after spinal anesthesia. These measurements have shown complete return to baseline activity after 5% lidocaine spinal anesthesia in very small study populations. Histopathologic or other physiologic data in humans are lacking; thus, information from controlled studies in humans is essentially not available. Lidocaine Controversy about the use of single-injection spinal lidocaine began in 1993 when Schneider et al. [20] published four cases of short-lived neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lidocaine. This was the first report to question the potential for neurotoxicity with standard clinical doses and concentrations of lidocaine after single-injection spinal anesthesia. Subsequent prospective, randomized studies reveal a 4%-33% incidence of TNS after lidocaine spinal anesthesia (Table 3) [21,22]. This incidence varies with the type of surgical procedure and is unaffected by baricity or the dilution of lidocaine to 0.5%. Contemporary reports of cauda equina syndrome after continuous lidocaine spinal anesthesia and the potential concentration-dependent neurotoxicity of lidocaine have led several authors to label TNS as a manifestation of subclinical neurotoxicity.Table 3: Incidence of Transient Neurologic Symptoms (TNS) with Spinal Anesthesia in Prospective Randomized StudiesAs previously discussed, laboratory work in both intrathecal and desheathed peripheral nerve models has proven that the concentration of lidocaine is a critical factor in neurotoxicity. Because concentrations of lidocaine <40 mM (approximately 1.0%) are not neurotoxic to desheathed peripheral nerve, such dilute concentrations of spinal lidocaine should not cause TNS if the syndrome is caused by subclinical concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. We recently examined whether spinal lidocaine concentrations of <1.0% might therefore decrease the incidence of TNS [21]. Patients undergoing knee arthroscopy were randomized to receive 50 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine as either a 2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5% solution. There was no difference in the incidence of TNS (18%) among the three groups. The high incidence of TNS with lidocaine concentrations <1%, despite further dilution in cerebrospinal fluid, seem to lessen the plausibility of a concentration-dependent neurotoxic etiology. Other potential etiologies for TNS include patient positioning, early mobilization, needle trauma, neural ischemia, pooling of local anesthetics secondary to maldistribution by pencil-point needles or the addition of glucose, muscle spasm, myofascial trigger points, and irritation of dorsal ganglia [21]. The etiology of TNS is undetermined, and further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In summary, local anesthetics all have the potential to be neurotoxic, particularly in concentrations and doses larger than those used clinically. In histopathologic, electrophysiologic, behavioral, and neuronal cell models, lidocaine and tetracaine seem to have a greater potential for neurotoxicity than bupivacaine at clinically relevant concentrations. Nonetheless, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics. Spinal Analgesics There is a complex system of different receptors for the transmission and inhibition of nociception in the spinal cord. These receptors include [micro sign]1-opioid receptors, alpha2-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, gamma-amino butyric acid agonist (GABA) receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The neuropeptides substance P and somatostatin function as activators and inhibitors of nociception, respectively, and arachidonic acid metabolites enhance pain transmission [23]. Drugs that have been administered spinally in humans are thought to act directly or indirectly within this array of agonists and receptor sites (Figure 2). For each drug, the animal safety data and the human safety data are presented and summarized in Table 4.Figure 2: Schematic of mechanisms and sites of actions of spinal analgesics. mu-1 = opioid receptor, m1 = muscarinic type I acetylcholine receptor, ACh = acetylcholine, alpha2 = adrenergic receptor, NE = norepinephrine, GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABAr = GABA receptor, NMDAr = N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NK-1r = neurokinin 1 receptor, NSAIDS = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, + and unshaded arrows = activation, - and black arrows = inhibition.Table 4: Evidence of Neurotoxicity of Spinal AnalgesicsOpioids Hydrophilic Opioids. Dogs and cats exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal morphine for several weeks through indwelling catheters showed no abnormal histopathology of the spinal cord under light microscopy [24,25]. Spinal cord blood flow is unaffected by 0.2 mg of intrathecal morphine in dogs [26]. Consistent with a lack of histologic or physiologic neurotoxicity, behavioral effects reported in rats receiving 10-100 [micro sign]g/kg intrathecal morphine did not include evidence of neurotoxicity [27]. Limited postmortem neurohistopathology studies in patients with cancer after long-term, continuous intrathecal infusions containing morphine failed to definitively implicate the drug (with metabisulfite preservative) in any histopathologic abnormalities [28,29]. Electrophysiologic study of spinal morphine is limited to examination of somatosensory evoked potentials, which are unchanged despite intense analgesia [30]. No clinical abnormalities attributable to intrathecal morphine were reported in these studies. Spinal meperidine has undergone no published preclinical animal neurotoxicity testing. In humans, spinal meperidine has been reported as an effective sole drug for surgical anesthesia without noted clinical neuropathology, but no formal neurotoxicity testing has been undertaken [31]. Spinal hydromorphone has not been safety tested in animals. A single report describes hydromorphone administered spinally with clonidine in a woman with cancer pain without postmortem evidence of abnormal neurohistopathology [32]. Lipophilic Opioids. In its present preservative-free, commercially available form, fentanyl is commonly administered spinally. However, fentanyl is also notably absent from animal safety testing data. Histopathologic studies of isolated rabbit vagus nerve axons bathed in test solution failed to show evidence of localized neural damage with fentanyl dissolved in isotonic solution. Potential electrophysiologic neurotoxicity was reported with the commercially available hypotonic solution of fentanyl, which caused permanent conduction deficits comparable to water alone [33]. In vivo, only relatively large doses of fentanyl citrate would be expected to create a hypotonic intrathecal environment. Controlled human safety data are also minimal with spinal fentanyl. There are no published reports specifically addressing the histologic, physiologic, or clinical evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal fentanyl. No report of persistent neurologic complications was retrieved from a MEDLINE search, despite widespread clinical use of spinal fentanyl. Sufentanil was administered to cats with indwelling intrathecal catheters for 5 days without distinguishable neurohistopathological abnormalities [27]. Similarly, dogs exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal sufentanil for several weeks also showed no abnormal histopathology [24]. However, sheep exposed to large (approximately 50 [micro sign]g) and very large (approximately 200 [micro sign]g) doses of sufentanil every 6 h for 3 days through intrathecal catheters showed evidence of dose-dependent spinal cord histopathology [34]. These findings may reflect a neurotoxic effect at large doses or quite possibly an artifact of the experimental design due to the frequent, large-volume, hypotonic preparation used in this study. No studies of spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology are available. The rats, cats, and dogs used in the above experiments had no persistent behavioral deficits. The sheep demonstrated dose-dependent agitation and hind-limb motor deficits that resolved spontaneously. There is no formal human neurotoxicity testing of sufentanil, but there are also no clinical reports of neurological impairment from widespread use. The spinal administration of alfentanil to cats for 5 days and to dogs for several weeks through indwelling intrathecal catheters induced no abnormal histopathology [24]. There are no reports of human experience with intrathecal alfentanil. Spinal remifentanil has been studied for efficacy in rats, but no histopathology has been published [35]. Rat behavior changes, other than sedation, were not reported, and recovery was not described. There is no published human experience with spinal remifentanil. Partial Opioid Receptor Agonists. In the sheep experiments with sufentanil noted above, butorphanol given intrathecally as a commercial solution of citrate and tartate salts caused florid histologic and behavioral pathology, whereas nalbuphine in saline was associated with minimal inflammatory histologic changes, mild neuronal changes at large doses, and transient hindlimb weakness [34]. No other animal or human data are available. In summary, laboratory studies and extensive clinical experience with morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil can reasonably assure the safety of limited intrathecal doses of these drugs. Other opioid agonists or partial agonists are without animal and human safety testing data. alpha2 Receptor Agonists Clonidine is the predominant spinal alpha2-agonist. Extensive preclinical tests in animals produced no neurohistopathologic abnormalities in rats, dogs, sheep, or monkeys. Spinal cord blood flow studies in rats, pigs, and awake sheep reveal perturbations that, on the whole, do not suggest significant decreases under normal clinical circumstances. No behavioral abnormalities suggesting neurotoxicity have been associated with intrathecal clonidine [36]. There has been extensive and graded exposure of humans to spinal clonidine (>968 surgical, obstetrical, and chronic pain patients) with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [36]. Although no histopathologic or physiologic studies have been reported, clonidine seems to be a safe spinal drug in humans. Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitors Neostigmine indirectly produces a muscarinic agonist effect by inhibiting acetycholinesterase and has been shown to cause analgesia in animal and human experiments. Neurohistopathological analysis of rats and dogs after long-term intrathecal neostigmine (with and without paraben preservatives) administration reveal no spinal cord toxicity [37,38]. Neostigmine does not affect spinal cord blood flow in sheep [37], and there were no behavioral changes suggesting neurotoxicity reported in the above animal studies. Phase I safety assessments in human volunteers have been performed for both preservative-free (50-750 [micro sign]g) and paraben-containing hyperbaric preparations (10-100 [micro sign]g) of spinal neostigmine without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [40,41]. Although the human experience with spinal neostigmine is limited, clinical trials performed thus far have not reported any evidence of neurologic sequelae. gamma-Amino Butyric Acid Agonists (Table 5) Midazolam. Unlike other benzodiazepines, midazolam is soluble in an aqueous solution when buffered to approximately pH 3.5. At physiologic pH, midazolam becomes lipophilic, facilitating tissue penetration. These characteristics have made midazolam the most extensively studied spinal benzodiazepine. Neurotoxicity studies in animals have yielded conflicting results. Four initial rat studies with intrathecal catheter implantation using 0.15 mg/kg for 15 days (two studies) or isolated exposures to 0.1-0.3 mg/kg of midazolam (two studies) prepared in saline solution showed no neurotoxic reactions on light or electron microscopy [42]. However, a subsequent study in rabbits after a single 0.1 mg/kg intrathecal injection of midazolam reported that three of nine animals (33%) showed spinal cord histopathologic changes 8 days after exposure [43]. The diffuse nature of the histopathologic abnormalities that uncharacteristically extended from cervical to lumbar sections, the presence of significant and persistent diastolic hypotension in the treatment group, and the delayed postmortem tissue fixation all suggest a possible systemic source of artifact in the three affected animals. To investigate these contrasting results, a state-of-the-art study on the rat was performed using light microscopy, electron microscopy, cell morphometry, and transcardial tissue fixation after daily intrathecal administration of approximately 0.3 mg/kg midazolam for 20 days [44]. The spinal cords showed strong evidence of neuronal death and cellular abnormalities, even on light microscopy, in most midazolam-treated rats. Of note, a hypotonic commercial preparation of midazolam was used in contrast to the isotonic saline preparation used in all previous reports. Hypotonicity results in permanent nerve injury in isolated nerve preparations [33] and has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of spinal sufentanil in sheep [45]. Although hypotonicity may be the etiology of the reported abnormalities, intrinsic neurotoxicity of spinal midazolam is a consideration.Table 5: Comparative Animal and Human Toxicity Data of Common Spinal AdjuvantsNo animal studies on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology have been reported. The effect of midazolam on blood-brain barrier integrity was investigated in the above-described study on rabbits and showed compromise in three of nine animals [43]. Despite some histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity, no significant behavioral abnormalities have been reported in any of the animal neurotoxicity studies of intrathecal midazolam. There are no histologic or physiologic studies of humans exposed to spinal midazolam, although there are seven small reports of intrathecal midazolam for anesthesia and pain management. Within this limited human experience, there are no reports of clinical neurologic deficit, even after prolonged continuous intrathecal use in four patients with chronic benign pain syndromes [46]. Midazolam neurotoxicity is controversial. Although the commercial midazolam solution seems to be neurotoxic in rats, hypotonicity of the solution may be culpable, rather than the drug itself. Midazolam in saline does not seems to be neurotoxic in the rat, but it may be toxic in the rabbit. There are insufficient studies in humans to determine the risk of neurotoxicity with spinal midazolam. Baclofen Spinal spasticity, which is thought to result from disinhibition of motor horn cells after upper motor neuron damage, can be treated with baclofen. Baclofen is a stable analog of GABA and interacts primarily with the inhibitory GABA-B receptors in lamina 2 of the dorsal horn (Figure 1). Twenty-eight dogs exposed to chronic spinal delivery of either saline, clinical, or supraclinical doses of baclofen showed no neurohistopathologic changes. Cats exposed to intrathecal baclofen for 8 days likewise showed no abnormal spinal cord histopathology [47]. No studies on spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology have been published with regards to intrathecal baclofen. Neither dogs, cats, nor monkeys showed behavioral evidence of neurotoxicity [25]. There are no published human studies evaluating histopathologic or physiologic neurotoxicity of baclofen. Spinal baclofen was infused in seven subjects for 3-22 mo without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [48]. An extensive review of cases involving intrathecal baclofen overdose did not note any long-term sequelae [49]. Based on animal studies and considerable clinical experience, spinal baclofen is not likely to cause neurologic damage. N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Antagonists Ketamine. Animal studies examining the neurotoxicity of ketamine generally support its safety, with the exception of some poorly explained findings. Studies performed in monkeys, baboons, and rabbits after single-dose intrathecal ketamine injections (0.3-0.6 mg/kg) with and without benzethonium chloride preservative did not uncover histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity [50,51]. In contrast, two other rat studies reported histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal ketamine. One study found vacuolization of the ganglion cells in posterior nerve roots in 3 of 33 rats that died immediately on injection of preservative-free ketamine [52]. However, it is difficult to ascribe these findings to ketamine neurotoxicity given the uncertain circumstances of demise. Similarly, another rat study with single intrathecal injections of 2.5 mg of ketamine hydrochloride with the preservative benzethonium chloride reported that two of six rats had radicular demyelination injury at sites distant from the injections on histological examination [53]. However, more than half of the animals in the ketamine treatment group either died after rapid injection (two rats) or had single hindlimb paralysis after injection (four rats), which puts the validity of the results in question. No animal studies have been published on the effect of spinal ketamine on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology. Rabbits showed a pattern of blood-brain barrier compromise differing significantly from that of saline-injected control rabbits after single 3-mg injections of ketamine with chlorbutanol [43] but not with preservative-free ketamine [50]. The neurotoxicity of spinal ketamine is largely untested in humans, despite a few case series reporting ketamine use for spinal anesthesia and analgesia [54]. Taken together, the rat, rabbit, and primate studies with intrathecal ketamine support its safety if used without a preservative. A small preliminary human experience suggests that the anesthetic is well tolerated. However, the commercially available preparation of ketamine contains an untested preservative (benzethonium chloride) and cannot be recommended for intrathecal use in humans. Amitriptyline. Preclinical animal testing of intrathecal amitriptyline is limited to a physiologic assessment in adult sheep [55]. A range of intrathecal doses (0.25, 1, or 5 mg) with a maximal dose representing approximately 25-50 times the anticipated human dose did not reduce spinal cord blood flow. No behavioral abnormalities were reported except for transient agitation with the injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline. The injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline into the cervical intrathecal space sedated the animals for 10-60 min, whereas 10 mg produced intense sedation and seizure, followed by death from uncertain causes in one animal. Long-term exposure and neurohistopathologic studies are reported to be in progress [55]. The determination of amitriptyline neurotoxicity awaits further investigation. Somatostatin In rats, intrathecal somatostatin (SST) produced marked, dose-dependent neurotoxic responses at or near doses required to produce analgesia [56] with similar findings in cats and mice [57]. SST administered in similar doses to guinea pigs, in contrast, did not provoke significant neurohistopathological changes [58]. Spinal SST in rats had significant vasoconstrictive effects in the spinal cord and brain, leading to reduced blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and compromised blood-brain barrier [59]. No spinal cord blood flow changes were seen in the guinea pig. Significant behavioral changes were noted in the rat, cat, and mouse experiments, but not in the guinea pig experiments. Species differences in the neurotoxic susceptibility to SST may explain these differences, but there is evidence for neurotoxicity in several animal species. In humans, spinal SST has been offered to terminally ill patients. Four patients with intractable cancer pain were studied after daily injections of spinal SST. Postmortem histopathology was undertaken on the spinal cords of two patients. One showed moderate degeneration of some dorsal roots within the cauda equina, whereas the other demonstrated no histopathologic changes. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were not discussed [60]. In summary, SST has been shown to be neurotoxic in rats, mice, and cats at doses comparable to those that confer analgesia. In humans, relatively small doses of SST have been anecdotally reported to variably relieve pain in the absence of overt neurologic sequelae. Based on this demonstrated record of neurotoxicity in several animal species, spinal SST should be considered a last-line analgesic only in the terminally ill patient. Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs Prostaglandins are involved in the spinal cord facilitation of pain processing, and spinal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can abolish wind-up behavior in animals [61]. Although the analgesic efficacy of spinal ketorolac has been established, no animal neurotoxicity studies have been published [61]. However, the 10% alcohol solvent used for commercial preparations is potentially neurotoxic, and commercial ketorolac should not be used spinally. Lysine acetylsalicylic acid (L-ASA) dosed intrathecally has been shown to be antinociceptive and has been tested in the rat for neurotoxicity with conflicting results. Although limited technically by a >50% spinal cord trauma rate related to needle puncture, one rat study reported radicular demyelination injury in one of the seven undamaged rats (14%) who received intrathecal L-ASA [53]. In contrast, neither histopathologic abnormalities nor a persistent decrease in spinal cord blood flow were seen in another rat study with large daily doses of L-ASA for at least 14 days [62]. The initial study described aggressive behavioral changes in rats after the spinal injection of L-ASA, leading to death from combat. The subsequent study did not report behavioral findings.

      "title": "The Neurotoxicity of Drugs Given Intrathecally (Spinal)",
      "abstract": "A growing understanding of the neuropharmacology of spinal cord processing of nociceptive input has led to intense interest in the use of spinal drugs in anesthesia and pain management. The direct application of receptor-specific therapeutics at the spinal cord can potentially interrupt specific pain pathways and limit systemic side effects, but this practice also carries the inherent risk of injury to the central nervous system. Thus, the neurotoxicity of spinal drugs is a central safety issue. Spinal cord or nerve root toxicity may manifest itself as histologic, physiologic, or behavioral/clinical derangements after exposure to a spinal drug. Neurohistopathology is broadly classified as neural injury, gliosis, or damage to the myelin sheath, and it also describes inflammatory changes and involvement of the arachnoid cell layers. Physiologic neurotoxicity of spinal drugs includes changes in spinal cord blood flow, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and changes in the electrophysiology of impulse conduction. Behavioral and clinical signs of neurotoxicity include pain, motor and sensory deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Ideally, a complete roster of histological, physiologic, and behavioral testing would be performed on spinal drugs in several animal species, followed by safety trials in humans before widespread use. In practice, drugs have taken a variety of roads from conception to application, and often without safety data. In this article, we review available neurotoxicity data on drugs that have a clinical application, classified as spinal local anesthetics, spinal analgesics, or spinal adjuvants. Spinal Local Anesthetics The 100-yr history of spinal local anesthetic use in humans has typically involved self-experimentation, followed by widespread application with little or no controlled testing for neurotoxicity. Bier and Hildebrant [1] initially performed spinal anesthesia with cocaine on themselves in 1898, and essentially all of the earliest local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia were introduced in this fashion without toxicity studies. Despite a long history of clinical use, recent interest in neurotoxicity has arisen due to concerns over reports of cauda equina syndrome and transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) from spinal local anesthetics. We review animal data that have been used to assess the neurotoxicity of local anesthetics and summarize data available from human studies. In 1985, Ready et al. [2] evaluated the neurotoxic effects of single injections of local anesthetics in rabbits. They reported that spinal cord histopathology remained normal and that persistent neurologic deficits were not seen with clinically used concentrations of tetracaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, or chlorprocaine. However, histopathologic changes and neurologic deficits did occur with higher concentrations of tetracaine (1%) and lidocaine (8%). In this model, extensive neurologic impairment was not necessarily accompanied by equally extensive lesions in the spinal cord and nerve roots, thus demonstrating the need for multiple models to fully assess neurotoxicity. Recent studies have used desheathed peripheral nerve models, designed to mimic unprotected nerve roots in the cauda equina, to further assess electrophysiologic neurotoxicity of clinically relevant concentrations of local anesthetics [3-5]. These models demonstrate that clinically used concentrations of 5% lidocaine and 0.5% tetracaine cause irreversible conduction block, whereas 1.5% lidocaine, 0.75% bupivacaine, and 0.06% tetracaine do not. Electrophysiologic toxicity of lidocaine in these models is concentration-dependent (Figure 1) beginning at 40 mM (approximately 1%) with irreversible ablation of the compound action potential at 80 mM (approximately 2%). Kanai et al. [4] subsequently demonstrated that generation of action potentials was more vulnerable than maintenance of resting membrane potential and that irreversible ablation of action and resting membrane potential by lidocaine seems to be both concentration- and time-dependent.Figure 1: The nonreversible effect of 40 mM lidocaine on the compound action potential (CAP) of frog sciatic nerve. Lidocaine was applied to a stable nerve preparation for 15 min, then washed with frog Ringer's solution for 2 h. Tracings represent CAPs in response to stimuli (1-Hz stimulus = heavy line, 40-Hz stimulus = thin line). Lidocaine 40 mM completely ablated the CAP when applied to the nerve. The 1-Hz CAP response began to return after 10-15 min of washing and reached a new level in 45 min, where it was stable for the subsequent 2 h of observation. The recovered 1-Hz CAP is only 65% of the original. Reprinted with the publisher's permission from Holman SJ. Anesthesiology: hyperbaric dye solution distribution. Anesthesiology 1997;86:969.Effects of local anesthetics on spinal cord blood flow seem benign. Spinal administration of bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, and tetracaine causes vasodilation and increase spinal cord blood flow [6,7], whereas ropivacaine causes concentration-dependent vasoconstriction and reduction in spinal cord blood flow [6]. However, the effects of lidocaine on blood flow of in vitro peripheral nerve models are more concerning. Myers et al. [8] applied solutions of isotonic sodium chloride solution, 1% and 2% lidocaine with and without epinephrine, and epinephrine alone to isolated rat sciatic nerve and measured changes in blood flow with a laser Doppler flow probe. Blood flow was significantly depressed for all solutions except isotonic sodium chloride solution. Epinephrine by itself significantly reduced nerve blood flow, and, when added to local anesthetic solutions, it reduced blood flow to a greater extent than the reduction caused by local anesthetics alone. Although experimental studies in animals have provided ample evidence that some local anesthetics in clinically relevant concentrations can injure nerve tissue, the exact mechanisms of injury are unclear. Recent work on neuronal cell lines has attempted to determine the mechanism of local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Johnson and Uhl [9] have shown that direct application of 2.5%-5.0% lidocaine caused a >3-fold increase in intracellular calcium and up to a 20% incidence of cell death during 60 min of exposure in the neuronal cell line. They postulated that the mechanism of neurotoxicity was not likely from sodium channel blockade, because such a block would not lead to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium. Subsequent work in this model determined that 0.5% and 1.0% lidocaine, as well as 0.625% bupivacaine, lead to transient, moderate increases in calcium, probably from the endoplasmic reticulum, without cell death [10]. Thus, several different laboratory models have proven that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic but that lidocaine and tetracaine are potentially more neurotoxic than bupivacaine (Table 1).Table 1: Local Anesthetic ToxicityDespite the knowledge that all local anesthetics can be neurotoxic in the laboratory model, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics in humans (Table 2). Retrospective [11], prospective [12], and historical studies [13-15] report 0%-0.7% incidence of postoperative neurologic injury in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Although lacking a denominator, information from closed-claims databases corroborate these findings [16,17]. Thus, the neurotoxic potential of spinally administered local anesthetics has not manifested itself in large-scale studies.Table 2: Large Epidemiologic Studies of the Neurologic Complications of Spinal AnesthesiaThere are few nonepidemiologic clinical studies evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of local anesthetics, and all have focused on electrophysiologic variables after spinal anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials, monosynaptic H-reflex [18], and cutaneous current perception thresholds [19] have been used to evaluate recovery after spinal anesthesia. These measurements have shown complete return to baseline activity after 5% lidocaine spinal anesthesia in very small study populations. Histopathologic or other physiologic data in humans are lacking; thus, information from controlled studies in humans is essentially not available. Lidocaine Controversy about the use of single-injection spinal lidocaine began in 1993 when Schneider et al. [20] published four cases of short-lived neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lidocaine. This was the first report to question the potential for neurotoxicity with standard clinical doses and concentrations of lidocaine after single-injection spinal anesthesia. Subsequent prospective, randomized studies reveal a 4%-33% incidence of TNS after lidocaine spinal anesthesia (Table 3) [21,22]. This incidence varies with the type of surgical procedure and is unaffected by baricity or the dilution of lidocaine to 0.5%. Contemporary reports of cauda equina syndrome after continuous lidocaine spinal anesthesia and the potential concentration-dependent neurotoxicity of lidocaine have led several authors to label TNS as a manifestation of subclinical neurotoxicity.Table 3: Incidence of Transient Neurologic Symptoms (TNS) with Spinal Anesthesia in Prospective Randomized StudiesAs previously discussed, laboratory work in both intrathecal and desheathed peripheral nerve models has proven that the concentration of lidocaine is a critical factor in neurotoxicity. Because concentrations of lidocaine <40 mM (approximately 1.0%) are not neurotoxic to desheathed peripheral nerve, such dilute concentrations of spinal lidocaine should not cause TNS if the syndrome is caused by subclinical concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. We recently examined whether spinal lidocaine concentrations of <1.0% might therefore decrease the incidence of TNS [21]. Patients undergoing knee arthroscopy were randomized to receive 50 mg of hyperbaric lidocaine as either a 2.0%, 1.0%, or 0.5% solution. There was no difference in the incidence of TNS (18%) among the three groups. The high incidence of TNS with lidocaine concentrations <1%, despite further dilution in cerebrospinal fluid, seem to lessen the plausibility of a concentration-dependent neurotoxic etiology. Other potential etiologies for TNS include patient positioning, early mobilization, needle trauma, neural ischemia, pooling of local anesthetics secondary to maldistribution by pencil-point needles or the addition of glucose, muscle spasm, myofascial trigger points, and irritation of dorsal ganglia [21]. The etiology of TNS is undetermined, and further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In summary, local anesthetics all have the potential to be neurotoxic, particularly in concentrations and doses larger than those used clinically. In histopathologic, electrophysiologic, behavioral, and neuronal cell models, lidocaine and tetracaine seem to have a greater potential for neurotoxicity than bupivacaine at clinically relevant concentrations. Nonetheless, large-scale surveys of the complications of spinal anesthesia attest to the relative safety of spinal local anesthetics. Spinal Analgesics There is a complex system of different receptors for the transmission and inhibition of nociception in the spinal cord. These receptors include [micro sign]1-opioid receptors, alpha2-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, gamma-amino butyric acid agonist (GABA) receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The neuropeptides substance P and somatostatin function as activators and inhibitors of nociception, respectively, and arachidonic acid metabolites enhance pain transmission [23]. Drugs that have been administered spinally in humans are thought to act directly or indirectly within this array of agonists and receptor sites (Figure 2). For each drug, the animal safety data and the human safety data are presented and summarized in Table 4.Figure 2: Schematic of mechanisms and sites of actions of spinal analgesics. mu-1 = opioid receptor, m1 = muscarinic type I acetylcholine receptor, ACh = acetylcholine, alpha2 = adrenergic receptor, NE = norepinephrine, GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABAr = GABA receptor, NMDAr = N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, NK-1r = neurokinin 1 receptor, NSAIDS = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, + and unshaded arrows = activation, - and black arrows = inhibition.Table 4: Evidence of Neurotoxicity of Spinal AnalgesicsOpioids Hydrophilic Opioids. Dogs and cats exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal morphine for several weeks through indwelling catheters showed no abnormal histopathology of the spinal cord under light microscopy [24,25]. Spinal cord blood flow is unaffected by 0.2 mg of intrathecal morphine in dogs [26]. Consistent with a lack of histologic or physiologic neurotoxicity, behavioral effects reported in rats receiving 10-100 [micro sign]g/kg intrathecal morphine did not include evidence of neurotoxicity [27]. Limited postmortem neurohistopathology studies in patients with cancer after long-term, continuous intrathecal infusions containing morphine failed to definitively implicate the drug (with metabisulfite preservative) in any histopathologic abnormalities [28,29]. Electrophysiologic study of spinal morphine is limited to examination of somatosensory evoked potentials, which are unchanged despite intense analgesia [30]. No clinical abnormalities attributable to intrathecal morphine were reported in these studies. Spinal meperidine has undergone no published preclinical animal neurotoxicity testing. In humans, spinal meperidine has been reported as an effective sole drug for surgical anesthesia without noted clinical neuropathology, but no formal neurotoxicity testing has been undertaken [31]. Spinal hydromorphone has not been safety tested in animals. A single report describes hydromorphone administered spinally with clonidine in a woman with cancer pain without postmortem evidence of abnormal neurohistopathology [32]. Lipophilic Opioids. In its present preservative-free, commercially available form, fentanyl is commonly administered spinally. However, fentanyl is also notably absent from animal safety testing data. Histopathologic studies of isolated rabbit vagus nerve axons bathed in test solution failed to show evidence of localized neural damage with fentanyl dissolved in isotonic solution. Potential electrophysiologic neurotoxicity was reported with the commercially available hypotonic solution of fentanyl, which caused permanent conduction deficits comparable to water alone [33]. In vivo, only relatively large doses of fentanyl citrate would be expected to create a hypotonic intrathecal environment. Controlled human safety data are also minimal with spinal fentanyl. There are no published reports specifically addressing the histologic, physiologic, or clinical evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal fentanyl. No report of persistent neurologic complications was retrieved from a MEDLINE search, despite widespread clinical use of spinal fentanyl. Sufentanil was administered to cats with indwelling intrathecal catheters for 5 days without distinguishable neurohistopathological abnormalities [27]. Similarly, dogs exposed to clinically relevant doses of intrathecal sufentanil for several weeks also showed no abnormal histopathology [24]. However, sheep exposed to large (approximately 50 [micro sign]g) and very large (approximately 200 [micro sign]g) doses of sufentanil every 6 h for 3 days through intrathecal catheters showed evidence of dose-dependent spinal cord histopathology [34]. These findings may reflect a neurotoxic effect at large doses or quite possibly an artifact of the experimental design due to the frequent, large-volume, hypotonic preparation used in this study. No studies of spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology are available. The rats, cats, and dogs used in the above experiments had no persistent behavioral deficits. The sheep demonstrated dose-dependent agitation and hind-limb motor deficits that resolved spontaneously. There is no formal human neurotoxicity testing of sufentanil, but there are also no clinical reports of neurological impairment from widespread use. The spinal administration of alfentanil to cats for 5 days and to dogs for several weeks through indwelling intrathecal catheters induced no abnormal histopathology [24]. There are no reports of human experience with intrathecal alfentanil. Spinal remifentanil has been studied for efficacy in rats, but no histopathology has been published [35]. Rat behavior changes, other than sedation, were not reported, and recovery was not described. There is no published human experience with spinal remifentanil. Partial Opioid Receptor Agonists. In the sheep experiments with sufentanil noted above, butorphanol given intrathecally as a commercial solution of citrate and tartate salts caused florid histologic and behavioral pathology, whereas nalbuphine in saline was associated with minimal inflammatory histologic changes, mild neuronal changes at large doses, and transient hindlimb weakness [34]. No other animal or human data are available. In summary, laboratory studies and extensive clinical experience with morphine, fentanyl, and sufentanil can reasonably assure the safety of limited intrathecal doses of these drugs. Other opioid agonists or partial agonists are without animal and human safety testing data. alpha2 Receptor Agonists Clonidine is the predominant spinal alpha2-agonist. Extensive preclinical tests in animals produced no neurohistopathologic abnormalities in rats, dogs, sheep, or monkeys. Spinal cord blood flow studies in rats, pigs, and awake sheep reveal perturbations that, on the whole, do not suggest significant decreases under normal clinical circumstances. No behavioral abnormalities suggesting neurotoxicity have been associated with intrathecal clonidine [36]. There has been extensive and graded exposure of humans to spinal clonidine (>968 surgical, obstetrical, and chronic pain patients) with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [36]. Although no histopathologic or physiologic studies have been reported, clonidine seems to be a safe spinal drug in humans. Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitors Neostigmine indirectly produces a muscarinic agonist effect by inhibiting acetycholinesterase and has been shown to cause analgesia in animal and human experiments. Neurohistopathological analysis of rats and dogs after long-term intrathecal neostigmine (with and without paraben preservatives) administration reveal no spinal cord toxicity [37,38]. Neostigmine does not affect spinal cord blood flow in sheep [37], and there were no behavioral changes suggesting neurotoxicity reported in the above animal studies. Phase I safety assessments in human volunteers have been performed for both preservative-free (50-750 [micro sign]g) and paraben-containing hyperbaric preparations (10-100 [micro sign]g) of spinal neostigmine without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [40,41]. Although the human experience with spinal neostigmine is limited, clinical trials performed thus far have not reported any evidence of neurologic sequelae. gamma-Amino Butyric Acid Agonists (Table 5) Midazolam. Unlike other benzodiazepines, midazolam is soluble in an aqueous solution when buffered to approximately pH 3.5. At physiologic pH, midazolam becomes lipophilic, facilitating tissue penetration. These characteristics have made midazolam the most extensively studied spinal benzodiazepine. Neurotoxicity studies in animals have yielded conflicting results. Four initial rat studies with intrathecal catheter implantation using 0.15 mg/kg for 15 days (two studies) or isolated exposures to 0.1-0.3 mg/kg of midazolam (two studies) prepared in saline solution showed no neurotoxic reactions on light or electron microscopy [42]. However, a subsequent study in rabbits after a single 0.1 mg/kg intrathecal injection of midazolam reported that three of nine animals (33%) showed spinal cord histopathologic changes 8 days after exposure [43]. The diffuse nature of the histopathologic abnormalities that uncharacteristically extended from cervical to lumbar sections, the presence of significant and persistent diastolic hypotension in the treatment group, and the delayed postmortem tissue fixation all suggest a possible systemic source of artifact in the three affected animals. To investigate these contrasting results, a state-of-the-art study on the rat was performed using light microscopy, electron microscopy, cell morphometry, and transcardial tissue fixation after daily intrathecal administration of approximately 0.3 mg/kg midazolam for 20 days [44]. The spinal cords showed strong evidence of neuronal death and cellular abnormalities, even on light microscopy, in most midazolam-treated rats. Of note, a hypotonic commercial preparation of midazolam was used in contrast to the isotonic saline preparation used in all previous reports. Hypotonicity results in permanent nerve injury in isolated nerve preparations [33] and has been implicated in the neurotoxicity of spinal sufentanil in sheep [45]. Although hypotonicity may be the etiology of the reported abnormalities, intrinsic neurotoxicity of spinal midazolam is a consideration.Table 5: Comparative Animal and Human Toxicity Data of Common Spinal AdjuvantsNo animal studies on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology have been reported. The effect of midazolam on blood-brain barrier integrity was investigated in the above-described study on rabbits and showed compromise in three of nine animals [43]. Despite some histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity, no significant behavioral abnormalities have been reported in any of the animal neurotoxicity studies of intrathecal midazolam. There are no histologic or physiologic studies of humans exposed to spinal midazolam, although there are seven small reports of intrathecal midazolam for anesthesia and pain management. Within this limited human experience, there are no reports of clinical neurologic deficit, even after prolonged continuous intrathecal use in four patients with chronic benign pain syndromes [46]. Midazolam neurotoxicity is controversial. Although the commercial midazolam solution seems to be neurotoxic in rats, hypotonicity of the solution may be culpable, rather than the drug itself. Midazolam in saline does not seems to be neurotoxic in the rat, but it may be toxic in the rabbit. There are insufficient studies in humans to determine the risk of neurotoxicity with spinal midazolam. Baclofen Spinal spasticity, which is thought to result from disinhibition of motor horn cells after upper motor neuron damage, can be treated with baclofen. Baclofen is a stable analog of GABA and interacts primarily with the inhibitory GABA-B receptors in lamina 2 of the dorsal horn (Figure 1). Twenty-eight dogs exposed to chronic spinal delivery of either saline, clinical, or supraclinical doses of baclofen showed no neurohistopathologic changes. Cats exposed to intrathecal baclofen for 8 days likewise showed no abnormal spinal cord histopathology [47]. No studies on spinal cord blood flow, blood-brain barrier effects, or electrophysiology have been published with regards to intrathecal baclofen. Neither dogs, cats, nor monkeys showed behavioral evidence of neurotoxicity [25]. There are no published human studies evaluating histopathologic or physiologic neurotoxicity of baclofen. Spinal baclofen was infused in seven subjects for 3-22 mo without clinical evidence of neurotoxicity [48]. An extensive review of cases involving intrathecal baclofen overdose did not note any long-term sequelae [49]. Based on animal studies and considerable clinical experience, spinal baclofen is not likely to cause neurologic damage. N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Antagonists Ketamine. Animal studies examining the neurotoxicity of ketamine generally support its safety, with the exception of some poorly explained findings. Studies performed in monkeys, baboons, and rabbits after single-dose intrathecal ketamine injections (0.3-0.6 mg/kg) with and without benzethonium chloride preservative did not uncover histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity [50,51]. In contrast, two other rat studies reported histopathologic evidence of neurotoxicity with spinal ketamine. One study found vacuolization of the ganglion cells in posterior nerve roots in 3 of 33 rats that died immediately on injection of preservative-free ketamine [52]. However, it is difficult to ascribe these findings to ketamine neurotoxicity given the uncertain circumstances of demise. Similarly, another rat study with single intrathecal injections of 2.5 mg of ketamine hydrochloride with the preservative benzethonium chloride reported that two of six rats had radicular demyelination injury at sites distant from the injections on histological examination [53]. However, more than half of the animals in the ketamine treatment group either died after rapid injection (two rats) or had single hindlimb paralysis after injection (four rats), which puts the validity of the results in question. No animal studies have been published on the effect of spinal ketamine on spinal cord blood flow or electrophysiology. Rabbits showed a pattern of blood-brain barrier compromise differing significantly from that of saline-injected control rabbits after single 3-mg injections of ketamine with chlorbutanol [43] but not with preservative-free ketamine [50]. The neurotoxicity of spinal ketamine is largely untested in humans, despite a few case series reporting ketamine use for spinal anesthesia and analgesia [54]. Taken together, the rat, rabbit, and primate studies with intrathecal ketamine support its safety if used without a preservative. A small preliminary human experience suggests that the anesthetic is well tolerated. However, the commercially available preparation of ketamine contains an untested preservative (benzethonium chloride) and cannot be recommended for intrathecal use in humans. Amitriptyline. Preclinical animal testing of intrathecal amitriptyline is limited to a physiologic assessment in adult sheep [55]. A range of intrathecal doses (0.25, 1, or 5 mg) with a maximal dose representing approximately 25-50 times the anticipated human dose did not reduce spinal cord blood flow. No behavioral abnormalities were reported except for transient agitation with the injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline. The injection of 5 mg of amitriptyline into the cervical intrathecal space sedated the animals for 10-60 min, whereas 10 mg produced intense sedation and seizure, followed by death from uncertain causes in one animal. Long-term exposure and neurohistopathologic studies are reported to be in progress [55]. The determination of amitriptyline neurotoxicity awaits further investigation. Somatostatin In rats, intrathecal somatostatin (SST) produced marked, dose-dependent neurotoxic responses at or near doses required to produce analgesia [56] with similar findings in cats and mice [57]. SST administered in similar doses to guinea pigs, in contrast, did not provoke significant neurohistopathological changes [58]. Spinal SST in rats had significant vasoconstrictive effects in the spinal cord and brain, leading to reduced blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and compromised blood-brain barrier [59]. No spinal cord blood flow changes were seen in the guinea pig. Significant behavioral changes were noted in the rat, cat, and mouse experiments, but not in the guinea pig experiments. Species differences in the neurotoxic susceptibility to SST may explain these differences, but there is evidence for neurotoxicity in several animal species. In humans, spinal SST has been offered to terminally ill patients. Four patients with intractable cancer pain were studied after daily injections of spinal SST. Postmortem histopathology was undertaken on the spinal cords of two patients. One showed moderate degeneration of some dorsal roots within the cauda equina, whereas the other demonstrated no histopathologic changes. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were not discussed [60]. In summary, SST has been shown to be neurotoxic in rats, mice, and cats at doses comparable to those that confer analgesia. In humans, relatively small doses of SST have been anecdotally reported to variably relieve pain in the absence of overt neurologic sequelae. Based on this demonstrated record of neurotoxicity in several animal species, spinal SST should be considered a last-line analgesic only in the terminally ill patient. Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs Prostaglandins are involved in the spinal cord facilitation of pain processing, and spinal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can abolish wind-up behavior in animals [61]. Although the analgesic efficacy of spinal ketorolac has been established, no animal neurotoxicity studies have been published [61]. However, the 10% alcohol solvent used for commercial preparations is potentially neurotoxic, and commercial ketorolac should not be used spinally. Lysine acetylsalicylic acid (L-ASA) dosed intrathecally has been shown to be antinociceptive and has been tested in the rat for neurotoxicity with conflicting results. Although limited technically by a >50% spinal cord trauma rate related to needle puncture, one rat study reported radicular demyelination injury in one of the seven undamaged rats (14%) who received intrathecal L-ASA [53]. In contrast, neither histopathologic abnormalities nor a persistent decrease in spinal cord blood flow were seen in another rat study with large daily doses of L-ASA for at least 14 days [62]. The initial study described aggressive behavioral changes in rats after the spinal injection of L-ASA, leading to death from combat. The subsequent study did not report behavioral findings.

The major causes of excessive daytime sleepiness include pathologic abnormalities of the central nervous system, such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia; deficiencies in quality or quantity of sleep, such as those caused by sleep apnea and poor sleep hygiene; disturbances to the body's natural circadian rhythm, such as those caused by shift work or jet lag; and drugs, which can increase sleepiness either therapeutically or as a side effect. Determining the cause of daytime sleepiness is the first step in treating it. Setting appropriate and realistic treatment goals with the patient and initiating treatment are the next steps.

      "abstract": "Hyperesthesia is characterized by heightened sensitivity to stimuli that typically does not evoke pain, manifesting as allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) or hyperalgesia (exaggerated pain from painful stimuli). This condition is commonly linked to neuropathic pain, arising from nerve fiber damage or alterations, particularly affecting A-fibers. Hyperesthesia can result from systemic diseases, mechanical trauma, or hereditary factors, affecting approximately 10% of the population. Mechanical hyperesthesia, the more common type, results from heightened sensitization of the somatosensory system, leading to discomfort from light stimuli like pinpricks or clothing friction. Managing hyperesthesia requires a multidisciplinary approach focusing on both underlying causes and improving quality of life. First-line treatments include antidepressants (TCAs and SNRIs), gabapentinoids, and topical agents like lidocaine and capsaicin. For refractory cases, interventional therapies, such as nerve blocks and neurostimulation, may be considered, though these are not first-line treatments due to limited evidence. Additionally, non-pharmacological approaches like choosing friction-reducing clothing fabrics play a critical role. Clothing materials with low friction coefficients, such as cotton or silk, can significantly improve comfort by reducing sensory triggers for those with hyperesthesia. Further research into fabric technologies, such as friction-reducing treatments and textronics, offers promising avenues for improving comfort and pain management.",

      "abstract": "The dopamine deficiency syndrome Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and reduced postural reflexes. Conditions with similar symptoms but other causes than PD (about 1/3 of cases) are called atypical parkinsonism. From a neuropathological perspective, PD is associated with loss of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons (related to motor symptoms) and accumulation of alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies in the mid-brain. Nigro-striatal pathways may also be involved in atypical parkinsonism, but lesions in other parts of the brain/basal ganglions dominate. Parkinsonism may also be related to chronic cerebrovascular disease or use of drugs with extrapyramidal side effects.Articles retrieved from PubMed were reviewed to examine current knowledge on diseases other than PD that can induce parkinsonism.Diseases with atypical parkinsonism usually start more symmetric than PD and tremor is either not present or differs from the typical rest tremor seen in PD. An exception is corticobasal degeneration with very asymmetric symptoms. Other (plus-) symptoms in atypical parkinsonism are (early) falling tendency, dizziness upon change of position, coordination difficulties or early cognitive decline.

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is an idiosyncratic and potentially life-threatening drug reaction. Although uncommon, NMS cases induced by oral quetiapine have been reported. Most reports have predisposing risk factors such as an organic brain disorder, concomitant use of other antipsychotics or lithium, overdose or rapid titration. NMS with low doses of quetiapine is a much rarer clinical picture. Venlafaxine is commonly associated with withdrawal upon discontinuation sometimes as soon as the next day. In this case report, a 40-year-old man treated with venlafaxine for generalized anxiety disorder with symptoms of full-blown NMS after venlafaxine withdrawal, induced by low-dose quetiapine (50 mg), is presented. In accordance with the previous reports, we speculate that venlafaxine withdrawal was a predisposing factor in our case however we also discussed other possible explanations for NMS. Acknowledging the risk of NMS, even with low doses of quetiapine in patients devoid of known risk factors, is of paramount importance for prompt diagnosis and mitigating morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, this is the first case of NMS with such a low dose of quetiapine without any other known risk factors or substances.

      "title": "Peripheral opioid antagonism",
      "abstract": "Opioid induced bowel dysfunction may be associated with constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating sensation and increased reflux of stomach contents. It may be unpredictable in onset, develop immediately after the first dose, persist throughout the analgesic period and, unlike the analgesia, exhibit lack of tolerance. This may follow both acute or chronic opioid intake. Acutely, it usually manifests as a part of a postoperative ileus that itself may be attributed to surgical stress, or to alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance [1]. In patients with chronic usage of opioids, the bowel dysfunction may manifest as a range of symptoms with more than half of patients experiencing constipation. While analgesia is predominantly attributed to centrally mediated opioid actions, these unwanted gastrointestinal side effects may be more peripherally related and have been associated with the enteric μ receptors [2]. This has led to the development of peripherally antagonist opioid drugs, two of which (methylnaltrexone and alvimopan) have been recently approved by the FDA (although not available in the UK yet) and release of a fixed-dose opioid agonist-antagonist combination (oxycodone and naloxone) in the UK and Europe. Methylnaltrexone (Fig. 1) is a charged, quarternary amine, a N-methyl derivative of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Addition of the methyl group confers polarity to the molecule and reduces the lipid solubility, hence reducing its passage across the blood-brain barrier [3]. Methylnaltrexone has a high affinity to the μ receptor (IC50 = 70 nmol.l−1) with some affinity to the κ receptor (IC50 = 575 nmol.l−1) and virtually no affinity to the δ receptor [3]. Methylnaltrexone is approved by the European Medicines Agency for clinical use and is administered subcutaneously in a dose of 0.15 mg.kg−1 (12 mg.0.6 ml−1 solution in a single vial) for treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced illness when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient. Methylnaltrexone. Clinically it has demonstrated a reduction in gastrointestinal time (93–110 min vs 140–163 min for placebo; 95% CI −73 to −32 min) [4]. It might be particularly beneficial for inpatients (both in postoperative and medical wards), many of whom are on long-term opioid therapy. These patients usually experience a good analgesic effect and response to opioids but have a poor compliance due to opioid induced bowel dysfunction. Methylnaltrexone has been used safely in patients on long-term methadone programmes administered both intravenously [5] and orally [6]. While it decreased oral-caecal transit time, no opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported in any of the groups. The side effects are predominantly associated with gut overactivity and may manifest as abdominal cramps and flatulence, although dose limiting orthostatic hypotension at high plasma concentrations (> 1400 ng.ml-1) has also been reported [4]. Alvimopan (Fig. 2) is a synthetic high molecular weight quarternary zwitterion (a molecule with both positive and negative regions of charge) that is a highly potent competitive antagonist at the human μ receptor. In contrast to methylnaltrexone, alvimopan has a higher affinity to the μ receptor and owes its action to its kinetics with a relatively slow dissociation from the receptors. Its oral bioavailability is only 6%, restricting its activity predominantly to the gut where it gets metabolised [7]. Although the molecule has been investigated for its efficacy in both opioid induced constipation and acute postoperative ileus, the focus in development has been primarily towards the latter. In patients who developed postoperative ileus after undergoing bowel resection and hysterectomy (Cochrane data, n = 2225) [4], alvimopan administration reduced the time to first bowel movement or flatus, or total time to pass flatus when compared with placebo [8–12]. Patients in the alvimopan group also showed a reduced requirement for postoperative X-ray and nasogastric tube insertion compared with placebo [4]. However, its use is currently limited to acute administration since, although alvimopan has demonstrated a reduction in time to first bowel movement and changes in spontaneous bowel movement frequency in patients on methadone programmes with opioid induced constipation, long-term efficacy studies have found an association between treatment with alvimopman and an increased risk of cardiovascular events (n = 7 (1.3%) vs n = 0) [13]. As these events were reported within the first 12 weeks of treatment, they may not be ultimately related to long-term duration of the dose, but there remains a need for concrete evidence with regards to the safety of the drug for its long-term usage. Alvimopan is licensed to prevent postoperative ileus in patients with a partial large or small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, and only approved for short-term use of no more than 15 doses. It is available as gelatin capsule, administered orally as 12 mg, 30 min to 5 h pre-operatively and 12 mg twice daily for 7 days postoperatively. Alvimopan. In contrast to the newer drugs, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, naloxone (Fig. 3) is a non-specific opioid antagonist that has been commonly used intravenously to reverse opioid related effects for years. Structurally a tertiary amine, it is the N-alkyl derivative of oxymorphine with substitution of the allyl group for the methyl group conferring its antagonist properties. It has a high affinity for the μ receptor and a lesser affinity for κ and δ receptors. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and is well absorbed following oral administration, where it undergoes hepatic metabolism with a low oral bioavailability of < 2% [14] This poor oral bioavailability limits any beneficial effects when administered orally in standard preparation and dosages. In theory, orally administered high doses of naloxone should be devoid of ‘central’ CNS-type effects while exerting an inhibitor effect on the ‘peripheral’ gastrointestinal system at the myenteric plexus in the gut, where μ receptors are primarily located. Oral naloxone has been studied for some time with regards to its CNS sparing action for some time and the results have been equivocal. Liu et al., [15] successfully demonstrated that naloxone administration improved bowel frequency in patients on long-term morphine and oxycodone for malignant and non-malignant pain, with patients in the naloxone group also needing more analgesia. The study was, however, inadequately powered (n = 9) to draw firm conclusions. In contrast, in a placebo controlled study of patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy (n = 43), naloxone administered epidurally alongside morphine improved constipation (p < 0.001) while there were no reported differences in pain scores between the two groups [16]. In patients who have received mechanical ventilation in the ICU on sedation/analgesia, naloxone administration via the nasogastric tube reduced both gastric reflux and pneumonia without reversing analgesia or triggering any increase in opioid requirement [17, 18]. A Cochrane review investigating the efficacy of naloxone on its own for opioid induced constipation failed to draw any positive conclusions due the variability of data and poor design of some of the studies [4]. One of the reasons may be that it is immediate release oral naloxone that has been primarily investigated in these studies; this might not outlast the longer acting opioid when used chronically. Naloxone. A new development has been the preparation of a fixed-dose of the oral prolonged-release opioid agonist, oxycodone, and prolonged-release naloxone, focussing mainly on opioid induced constipation. A placebo controlled, double-blind study, investigating the efficacy of oral prolonged-release naloxone in patients with mainly non-malignant chronic pain (n = 202) on stable prolonged-release oxycodone, reported an improvement in bowel function [19]. No loss of analgesic efficacy with naloxone was observed. In another phase-III, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study in patients with chronic non-malignant back pain (n = 463), a fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone demonstrated a superior analgesic efficacy over placebo (p < 0.001) [20]. In this study, a subset analysis of 59 patients with a higher bowel function index, (a patient-reported quantitative measure of constipation) reported a decrease in scores (improving constipation) over a period of 12 weeks. A comparative study of oral prolonged-release oxycodone vs a combination of oral prolonged-release oxycodone and naloxone, in patients with moderate to severe non-malignant pain, reported a similar improvement in bowel function without reducing analgesic efficacy [21]. Available for use in Europe since 2006 and now available in UK in a fixed-dose preparation of prolonged-release oxycodone hydrochloride/naloxone combination (10 mg/5 mg and 20 mg/10 mg), it is currently licensed for treatment of severe pain that can only be managed with opioid analgesics. Managing opioid induced gastrointestinal side effects has always been a challenge. Development of the two new, exciting, peripherally acting μ receptor antagonists, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, holds promise–especially in the acute peri-operative situation, while the unique fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone might confer therapeutic advantage in patients on chronic opioid therapy, where constipation remains the most common side effect of long-term opioid administration.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome with Exposure from Tetrahydrocannabinol: a Case Report to Highlight the Side Effects of Increasing Use of CBD Products (5302)",
      "abstract": "Objective: N/A Background: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by over-activation of the serotonin (5-HT) system in the CNS. This can occur with the therapeutic use of serotonergic agents or inadvertent complex drug interactions between serotonergic agents. Clinical presentation varies widely in severity and is diagnosed by the decision rules of Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria, utilizing the three main clinical categories: altered mental status, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities. Design/Methods: A 63 year-old male with medical history most notable for restless leg syndrome (on ropinirole), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, depression on duloxetine, and chronic alcohol abuse presented with altered mental status, shaking, diaphoresis, and an inability to walk. He had initiated intake of THC-infused cheese as a neuropathic pain control measure. On examination, he was afebrile, hypertensive and mildly tachycardic, somnolent, diaphoretic, and diffusely hyperreflexic. Urine toxicology screen was positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). He was treated with intravenous fluids and lorazepam with improvement of symptoms. With continued supportive therapy and discontinuation of duloxetine, the patient completely recovered within 48 hours and was discharged home without residual symptoms. Results: N/A Conclusions: The cannabinoid (CB) receptors and endogenous agonists are widely distributed throughout the CNS and are involved in the regulation of mood. This endocannabinoid system is known to regulate serotonergic system through several mechanisms: modulation of 5-HT release, receptor expression, and regulation of excitability of 5-HT neurons. With the legalization of marijuana and increasing access to cannabinoid-containing products, it is imperative to raise awareness of the serotonergic effects of these products and to educate patients to avoid use of these products if they are currently taking a serotonergic agent. Complete workup of a patient with serotonin syndrome should include a urine drug screen and comprehensive social history. Disclosure: Dr. Tschoe has nothing to disclose.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common brain disorder in the elderly. In most patients who develop dementia the core syndrome of cognitive dysfunction is superimposed over the course of the disease by behavioral disorders that manifest at least temporarily to varying degrees. These include depression, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, aggression, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, delusions and hallucinations. Classical psychiatric exploration can be complemented by the use of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) which allows structured diagnosis and comparative documentation of the clinical course. The majority of psychotropic drugs used in psychogeriatics have not been specifically developed for or tested in elderly, often multimorbid patients. Substances used in psychogeriatrics are subject to special requirements due to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes specific to very old persons. They must show clinical efficacy and a low rate of cardiovascular, peripheral and central anticholinergic effects, a low delirogenic potential and favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Most of the newer atypical neuroleptics (e.g. risperidone) and the newer antidepressants (e.g. from the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, or selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs) tend to fulfill these criteria better than the high-potency neuroleptics of the butyrophene type (e.g. haloperidol) or the tricyclic antidepressants. For that reason, these newer products should usually be preferred over the conventional agents.",

      "abstract": "SLC25A46-related neuropathy or Hreditary motor or Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type VIB (HMSN 6B) is an autosomal recessive neurological disorder characterized mainly by early-onset optic atrophy resulting in progressive visual loss and peripheral axonal sensorimotor neuropathy with highly variable age at onset and severity. We report a Homozygous pathogenic mutation in SLC25A46 (c.1018C > T) in our index patient and his family members associated with characteristic imaging and clinical features. Eleven year old male presented with insidious onset, progressive vision loss & swaying since 8 years of age. He had no prior admissions or neurology consult, family history was not contributory. On examination (Video 1) gait ataxia, torticollis to left and tilt to right, head tremors and myoclonus with other findings of optic atrophy, hypotonia, impaired joint position & vibration up to ankle with absent ankle reflex were noted. Further findings of Pes cavus was present prompting for further investigation and diagnosis. On investigations routine blood and serology was normal, vitamin b12, serum cortisol and creatinine phosphokinase was normal. Thyroid profile showed markedly raised TSH of more than 100 mIU/L, TPO Antibodies of 971 IU/mL. Nerve conduction study had symmetrical sensory motor axonal neuropathy. MRI Brain (Fig. 1) T2 flair sequence shows hyperintensities in bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and T1shows cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 2). In view of his thyroid changes a Diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis was made and started on adequate doses of thyroxine but with no response and due to progression of the symptoms further investigation was carried. Pyruvate- 0.99 mg/dL (0.37–0.88) and Lactate- 9.70 mg/dL (4.5–14.4) levels were done to rule out any mitochondrial pathology including genetics for mitochondrial disorders which were normal. Mother was diagnosed to have hypothyroidism, clinical and neurological examination was unremarkable in her. In view of this varied presentation and a probable asymptomatic carrier state in the mother, whole exome sequencing(WES) was done which identified a Homozygous pathogenic mutation in SLC25A46 (c.1018C > T/p.Arg340Cys) gene, Mother and other unaffected family members were diagnosed as carriers for this pathogenic mutation (c.1018C > T). He was started on conservative management with beta blockers, vitamin E supplements, and gabapentin with limited response. Biallelic missense and loss of function variants in SLC25A46 have been reported to cause optic atrophy, axonal peripheral neuropathy and cerebellar atrophy. Slc25a46 is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays an important role in maintaining the mitochondrial cristae and balancing mitochondrial fission and fusion, probably acting in a pro-fission manner. Slc25a46 deficiency has been suggested to be included in the spectrum of optic atrophy 'plus' that are related to defective mitochondrial dynamics.1-4 SLC25A46 loss of-function mutations have also been identified with lethal congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Affected individuals also have cerebellar or pontocerebellar atrophy on brain imaging, and they may show abnormal movements, such as ataxia, dysmetria, and myoclonus. The most severely affected patients are hypotonic at birth and die in infancy.5, 6 The MRI findings of our case and from charlesworth et al, with cerebellar hyperintensities can add as an early diagnostic clue for identifying this rare disorder. It needs further confirmation of this entity but these two cases add more to our clinical knowledge to this complex disorder.7 In conclusion this case highlights the complex heterogeneity and rarity of the presentation with unique features of cervical dystonia and a probable association of Hashimoto's thyroiditis which needs further validation with characteristic association of optic atrophy and axonal neuropathy supporting a clinical diagnosis of SLC25A46-related neuropathy, confirmed by WES with a Homozygous pathogenic mutation in SLC25A46 (c.1018C > T/p.Arg340Cys) gene.

Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The Holmes tremor, once known as rubral or mesencephalic tremor, is an uncommon and atypical condition that presents as an irregular resting tremor, often accompanied by an action tremor that worsens with certain postures. This phenomenon is primarily caused by vascular or traumatic injuries that impact the cerebellothalamocortical pathway and the Guillain-Mollaret triangle. Currently, there is no therapeutic protocol based on randomized clinical trials, and the efficacy of the proposed treatments varies significantly. First-line pharmacological treatments include levodopa, levetiracetam, and trihexyphenidyl, the latter frequently prescribed at high doses. We present a case of Holmes tremor associated with a pontine-mesencephalic hematoma, which showed a favorable response to standard-dose trihexyphenidyl. Clinical case: A 60-year-old patient presented with a hemorrhagic stroke in the brainstem secondary to hypertensive microangiopathy, characterized by a sudden disturbance in consciousness and a favorable outcome. After twenty-six days, Holmes tremors were observed in the right brachiofacial area. The patient was started on trihexyphenidyl at standard doses, which were gradually increased to a total of 12 mg taken in three doses, resulting in nearly complete resolution of the tremors. At the three-month follow-up, the patient exhibited only mild dysarthria as a residual effect. Conclusion: The choice to administer trihexyphenidyl was particularly challenging due to the patient's pre-existing vigilance issues and her advanced age. Nonetheless, by refraining from high doses, the tremors were resolved, underscoring the necessity for comprehensive studies to formulate effective treatment protocols and to personalize therapeutic decisions for each individual patient Keywords: Holmes tremor, primary brainstem hemorrhage (PBH), Trihexyphenidyl, elderly patient, case report.",

The pain associated with the pathophysiological processes of inflammation is more persistent, differs in quality, but can also be considered as a normal protective response to tissue injury which can resolve rapidly once the injury has healed, e.g. post-operative pain, toothache, cystitis. At the other extreme, chronic pain associated with inflammation, tissue damage or nerve lesions is long lasting, and may involve a chronic pathological lesion or degenerative process, but sometimes there may be no discernible pathology. These types of pain syndrome (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, low back pain, pelvic and abdominal pain, cancer and neuropathic pain, migraine) are not well understood and are more difficult to treat. Indeed chronic pain suffers account for 10–20% of the adult population where approximately 5% experience pain which is poorly treated and is debilitating (loss of work, family crisis, depression, suicide) [1, 2].

      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.).

Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M.

Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar].

Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M.

Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff play an important role in the improvement of depressive symptoms in the cancer patient. Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

In continuation of our overview of potential novel antipsychotic pharmacotherapy that would be based upon indirect modulation of dopamine or other neurotransmitter functioning, we focus in this article on the postulated use of retinoid analogs as novel antipsychotic agents. Several lines of evidence can be viewed as implicating retinoid dysregulation in schizophrenia, either as a causative or contributory factor. It has been proposed that using retinoid analogs to alter the downstream expression of dopamine D2 receptors might represent a novel approach to the treatment of the disease or amelioration of symptoms when used either as monotherapy or as adjunct pharmacotherapy to dopamine D2 receptor antagonists.",

Interactions are divided into pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic. Knowledge of the interactions of local anesthetics with commonly prescribed drugs is necessary to prevent a possible toxic effect or lack of action of the drug.\r\n Local anesthetics interact with other local anesthetics, benzodiazepines, sulfonamides, and propranolol.

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is characterized by altered consciousness, fever, extrapyramidal signs, autonomic instability, elevated creatine kinase level, and leukocytosis. Although originally described in patients receiving neuroleptic drugs, this syndrome may also occur in patients with Parkinson's disease during withdrawal or reduction of levodopa therapy or other dopaminergic drug therapy. We have encountered three cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to withdrawal of levodopa therapy. These cases illustrate the variety of circumstances in which alteration of therapy with dopaminergic drugs can cause this syndrome and the relative unfamiliarity of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome—levodopa relationship among physicians who do not treat large numbers of patients with Parkinson's disease. An understanding of the role of brain dopamine in the pathogenesis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and an appreciation of the great variety of drugs whose manipulation can result in this potentially fatal syndrome will aid its proper and timely recognition, especially when the offending pharmacologic manipulation does not involve neuroleptic drugs.

      "abstract": "Abstract Drugs may sometimes aggravate seizures, deﬁned as an increase in either frequency or severity of existing seizures, emergence of new types of sei-zures, or the occurrence of status epilepticus. Pharmacodynamic aggravation of epilepsy usually translates into both increased seizure frequency and increased interictal electroencephalographic changes. A doubling or greater in seizure frequency may be considered as evidence for seizure aggravation. Seizure aggravation can occur with virtually all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (Somerville, 2002; Gayatri and Livingston, 2006). As the underlying mechanisms for antiseizure effects of AEDs are not fully understood, the mechanisms involved in seizure aggravation cannot be explained with certainty.",

Clearly the patient was confused and had a shortened attention span. We are not told of his capacity to manipulate old knowledge, learn new information, or orient himself. The authors appear to doubt that the aberrant behavior was organically derived. In fact, the observation that procainamide hydrochloride can induce an acute confusional state with delirium, if true, is an important clinical observation. The clinical picture described is familiar to any clinic having administered scopolamine to a woman in labor or having treated an alcoholic during an abstinence syndrome or a patient with herpes simplex encephalitis. Surely, we should avoid imprecise terms like \"functional psychosis\" to describe such patients. As biochemical psychiatry comes of age, it is increasingly important",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease responds rather dramatically to levodopa therapy during the first several years of treatment. With advancing disease, however, symptom control becomes more erratic, and some symptoms may become refractory to treatment. The use of selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl) has been proposed to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease; however, current evidence suggests that it is only partially effective at best, and there is no definite proof of a neuroprotective effect. Nonetheless, it is a reasonable treatment choice. Carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) remains the foundation of symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. Clinical fluctuations occurring with advancing disease may be at least partially controlled by appropriate adjustments in dosage. A direct-acting dopamine agonist, bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel) or pergolide mesylate (Permax), can be very helpful as adjunctive therapy to smooth these clinical fluctuations. Excessive intracellular oxidative stress has been proposed as a cause of Parkinson's disease; however, a recent multicenter trial investigating the use of high doses of the antioxidant vitamin E showed it to be ineffective. Whether other forms of nonspecific antioxidant therapy will prove beneficial is open to speculation.",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

To compensate the missing analgesic effect the additional use of psychotropic drugs is common. There is still little knowledge that just this therapeutic strategy of underuse leads to iatrogenic addiction. To avoid misunderstandings and irritations in the discussion around addiction, there must be clearly distinguished between physical and psychological dependence. There is sufficient evidence that especially tranquilizers and mixed analgesics induce the development of psychological dependence. In pain therapy there is no indication for these substances. In contrast opioids can be used without causing psychological dependence, presuming the guidelines of drug therapy in chronic pain (e.g. WHO guidelines) are attended.",

The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Lisdexamfetamine (LDX), a prodrug of d ‐amphetamine, is widely used in the pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and binge eating disorder (BED). Chemically, it consists of the amino acid lysine linked to d ‐amphetamine. Its enzymatic conversion to d ‐amphetamine sets the stage for a prolonged and controlled release, influencing its clinical profile and differentiating it from other stimulant medications. As a central nervous system stimulant, LDX primarily acts by increasing the release of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brain. Clinically, this enhanced availability of neurotransmitters is believed to contribute to improvements in attention, focus and impulse control in individuals with ADHD. The side effects of LDX include insomnia, decreased appetite, weight loss and xerostomia. This work reviews the pharmacological mechanisms, clinical applications and forensic considerations associated with its use. It is expected that clinicians, researchers and policymakers have a comprehensive understanding of the pharmacological and toxicological aspects of LDX.",

      "title": "Hypocalcemia-Induced Reversible Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Hypocalcemia can manifest as a variety of presentations, ranging from neuromuscular irritability to seizures, and psychiatric manifestations such as emotional instability, anxiety, and depression. Here, we present a unique case of hypocalcemia-induced acute psychosis. A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with confusion and agitation for four to five days. The patient was noted by the family to have decreased oral intake and sleep. Auditory and visual hallucinations prompted the family to bring the patient to the ED. The patient was mildly tachycardic. Initially, the patient was agitated, impulsive, and aggressive, exhibiting psychotic features including visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought broadcasting, tangential and perseverative thought processes, and erotomanic delusions. She had mild leukocytosis and elevated procalcitonin on admission. A thorough workup ruled out infectious/inflammatory processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for acute meningitis/encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis antibodies, and paraneoplastic etiology. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal and thyroid antibodies were negative. The CT brain and MRI brain were unremarkable. The patient was severely hypocalcemic (6.7) with low parathyroid hormone (<6) on admission. To note, the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN2B). She underwent total thyroidectomy five months prior for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma complicated by postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The patient had been non-compliant with calcium and calcitriol supplementation postoperatively. The patient was started on IV calcium gluconate and transitioned to calcitriol with calcium level improvement over the next three days. She experienced marked improvement, with the resolution of her psychosis. The patient's subacute onset psychosis with no personal or family psychiatric history and a rapid response to calcium correction supports hypocalcemia etiology. This case illustrates new-onset acute psychosis in a patient with calcium regulation imbalance. The development of hypocalcemia secondary to thyroidectomy with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism and calcium supplement non-compliance precipitated psychosis. A few similar cases have been reported, and here, we note that treatment of hypocalcemia promptly resolves symptoms. As per our review, this will be the first case of neuropsychiatric symptoms without associated cortical calcifications seen on imaging. It is important to recognize hypocalcemia as a rare cause of psychosis so as to not mistakenly categorize such presentations as primary psychotic disorders and miss a medically treatable illness.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To present a patient with history of Klinefelter9s syndrome (KS) presenting with parkinsonism in a setting of a normal presynaptic dopaminergic function by DAT scan SPECT brain.\nBackground: Klinefelter syndrome, 47 XXY is the most prevalent chromosome aberration. Patients with Klinefelter9s syndrome may present multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric abnormalities including a syndrome similar to Essential Tremor, slow motor development and attention problems. However, Parkisnonism has not been described in patients with KS. We describe a case of progressive Parkinsonism of unclear etiology in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome and tremor.\nDesign/methods: Single case report\nResults / Case report: 51yo male with history of KS who presented with action, posture and resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, ataxia, fatigue and cognitive decline. Clinical course had started and progressed since the age of 29. Later symptoms included urinary frequency, constipation, major depression with psychosis, dystonia, restless legs and obstructive sleep apnea. Trials with Propranolol, Clonazepam, and Amantadine had provided only minimal benefits. Brain MRI showed a single, non-specific lesion on the right frontal lobe. Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome, Wilson’s disease, and drug-induced parkinsonism were ruled out. DaTSCAN of the brain showed no pre-synaptic dopaminergic dysfunction.\nConclusions: Patients with KS have been reported to have multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Parkinsonism in a setting of a normal presynaptic dopaminergic function has been never described in patients with KS. It is possible that some of the KS patients present with postsynaptic abnormalities in dopamine receptors on the striatum responsible for this parkinsonian phenotype. Parkinsonism must be added to the spectrum of neurological syndromes in patients with KS. Disclosure: Dr. Lago has nothing to disclose. Dr. Moore has nothing to disclose.

      "title": "The Role of NMDA Receptors in Opiate Tolerance, Sensitization, and Physical Dependence",
      "abstract": "When administered acutely, opiates such as morphine produce characteristic behavioral effects, including a decrease in pain responsiveness (analgesia) and an increase in pleasure (euphoria). Because of their profound ability to produce analgesia, opiates are the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe or chronic pain. Because of their ability to produce positive reinforcement and pleasure, these drugs are widely self-administered and, therefore, represent an important class of abused drugs. Long-term treatment with opiates, as well as other drugs of abuse, leads to three well-known consequences: tolerance, which is a decrease in an effect of a drug with chronic use; sensitization, which is an increase in an effect of drug with chronic use; and physical dependence, which is a physiological change produced by chronic use, such that the absence of the drug results in an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome* (1–3). Tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence are important in both the clinical use of opiates and in their self-administration. For example, the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of opiates may lead to the need to escalate the dose during the treatment of chronic pain, whereas tolerance to the euphorigenic effect may be a factor in the escalation of drug use in addicts (4). Conversely, tolerance to dose-limiting side effects may allow addicts to escalate drug intake and achieve greater euphorigenic effects. The development of sensitization is thought to be involved in the craving that occurs following chronic use of drugs of abuse and, therefore, critical to addiction (5,6). Finally, the avoidance of withdrawal in physically dependent individuals is considered to be an important factor in maintaining self-administration (2,4).",

      "abstract": "Despite major advances in the treatment of mood disorders, major depression, a common mental disorder, remains a serious public health problem. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) regardless of the anesthetic agent used, is the most effective form of treatment in major depression and the gold standard therapy in treatment resistant depression. Ketamine is one of the anesthetic drugs approved by the Αmerican Psychiatric Association Task Force Report for use in ECT. However, it has been used infrequently as an anesthetic in ECT. The initial reports suggested that ketamine has antidepressant properties resulting in rapid antidepressant response when administered in subanesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) in slow intravenous injection in patients suffering from depression. In recent trials has been reported that ketamine as the only anesthetic or as an adjunctive to another anesthetic agent may enhance the antidepressant effect of ECT either by increasing efficacy or by producing a rapid antidepressant response. ECT with ketamine may also cause less cognitive side effects. The most notable limitations of these studies are the small number of patients enrolled and several methodological differences (patients characteristics, electrode placements, titration method, anesthetic agent used with ketamine). The results of the clinical trials have been summarized in six meta-analysis and suggest that ketamine when used as a sole anesthetic agent or as an adjunctive anesthetic in ECT may accelerates the antidepressant response but does not augment ECT efficacy. It also does not improve the cognitive profile of the treatment. Larger, double-blind randomized controlled trial are needed for a definite conclusion.",

      "abstract": "Long-haul flights allow rapid crossing of times zones. When four time zones are crossed, the transmeridian flight induce jet-lag syndrome. Jet-lag is essentially composed of digestive and behavioural disturbances (insomnia and/or drowsiness). It is due to an immediate conflict between external time cues, which have been phase-advanced or phase-delayed by eastward or westward flight, respectively, and the endogenous clock. This conflict induces a desynchronization of the biological rhythms. Different counter-measures could be advised, but the most used is the pharmacological one. Hypnotics like benzodiazepines, cyclopyrones or imidazopyridines induce a recovery sleep but could also induce secondary effects in case of chronic use. Melatonin secreted by pineal gland needs more studies before a safety use for jet-lag treatment. Psychostimulants are able to induce a prolonged wakefulness. But amphetamine-like substances have to be forbidden because of the importance of side effects. New researches are studying a new galenic form of caffeine: the time release caffeine, which permits to induce a long and good quality wakefulness.",

These and other movement disorders may also occur as presenting or prominent features of general neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or CNS tumors. Moreover, they may also occur in the setting of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, intoxications, hematological diseases, cancer, or infection.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Myoclonic seizures can be observed in various clinical settings and different epileptic conditions, including some forms of both diopathic and symptomatic epilepsies. Relatively little has been written on treatment of myoclonic seizures. Some old antiepileptic drugs, such as valproate and some benzodiazepines, are widely used but more treatment options exist today for some newer antiepileptic drugs. Nevertheless, patients can be refractory to drug treatment and some drugs may exacerbate or even induce myoclonus. Areas covered: Key safety, tolerability, and efficacy data are presented for different antiepileptic drugs with antimyoclonic effect, alone and/or in combination. Expert opinion: Treatment of myoclonic seizures in children is mainly based on prospective and retrospective studies, with little evidence from randomized clinical trials. Valproate is commonly the first choice alone or in combination with some benzodiazepines or levetiracetam. There is still insufficient evidence for the use of topiramate and zonisamide as monotherapy. Of major importance remains avoidance of medication that may aggravate the seizures. Better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of myoclonic seizures and myoclonic epilepsies could yield great improvement in the treatment and quality of life of patients.",

It resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome and is characterized by fever, marked rigidity, altered consciousness, leucocytosis and elevated creatine kinase. Malignant syndrome is a potentially fatal condition and awareness of this condition is imperative for prevention and treatment. The commonest precipitating factor is dopaminergic drug withdrawal or dose reduction. We report malignant syndrome (precipitated by hyponatremia) in a case of Parkinson's disease, in the absence of dopaminergic drug withdrawal. A 60-year-old man presented with fever, severe rigidity and altered sensorium following repeated vomiting. On investigation, he was found to have hyponatremia precipitated malignant syndrome. Treatment with hydration, cooling, correction of hyponatremia and dopaminergic drugs reversed his condition. The triad of fever, severe rigidity and altered sensorium should prompt evaluation for malignant syndrome in Parkinson's disease.",

The exact mechanism is unknown, but the cramps are probably caused by muscle fatigue and nerve dysfunction rather than electrolyte or other abnormalities. Nocturnal leg cramps are associated with vascular disease, lumbar canal stenosis, cirrhosis, hemodialysis, pregnancy, and other medical conditions. Medications that are strongly associated with leg cramps include intravenous iron sucrose, conjugated estrogens, raloxifene, naproxen, and teriparatide. A history and physical examination are usually sufficient to differentiate nocturnal leg cramps from other conditions, such as restless legs syndrome, claudication, myositis, and peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory evaluation and specialized testing usually are unnecessary to confirm the diagnosis. Limited evidence supports treating nocturnal leg cramps with exercise and stretching, or with medications such as magnesium, calcium channel blockers, carisoprodol, or vitamin B(12). Quinine is no longer recommended to treat leg cramps.",

Particular etiologies at risk for seizures include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury. The use of prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration remains controversial in many situations, with most of the larger studies having used older antiepileptic drugs prophylactically. If seizures do occur, patients are typically treated with parenteral antiepileptic drugs. The duration of treatment is unknown in most situations, but it should be individualized depending on acute and monophasic injury versus chronic process. Late seizures, which occur after the first 2 weeks from the insult, have a more ominous risk for subsequent epilepsy and should be treated for extended periods of time or indefinitely. Electrolyte and glucose abnormalities and medications at high or low levels, when corrected, usually lead to seizure control. This review discusses the risk for seizures with commonly encountered types of brain injuries in the NICU and ends by examining the treatment algorithms for simple seizures and status epilepticus and the role newer antiepileptics may potentially play.",

      "abstract": "This article has dealt with the psychophysiological phenomenon known as \"hyperventilation syndrome.\" Published research on this syndrome dates back at least a century to Da Costa's classic investigation involving \"soldier's heart\". Various labels such as \"effort syndrome,\" \"anxiety neurosis,\" \"neurocirculatory asthenia,\" \"vasoregulatory asthenia,\" and \"irritable heart,\" have been employed over the past century to describe this syndrome. The use of different labels to describe this syndrome seems to be inappropriate. While the symptoms associated with these diagnostic labels appear to be remarkably similar, the treatment for the syndrome often differs as a function of the diagnostic label. Symptoms include breathlessness or dyspnea with effort, parathesia, trembling, tachycardia, tetany, carpopedal spasms, and convulsions in the case of a full-blown attack. Hyperventilation, a normal consequence of vigorous exercise and/or high temperatures, can often occur in some individuals for no apparent reason. Hyperventilation, and the resulting physiological changes, are often associated with decrements in psychomotor performance along with increased error rates. The symptoms which characterize the hyperventilation syndrome can be readily produced in certain \"types\" of individuals within minutes by requiring the individual to overbreathe or through introduction of a CO2 challenge. The symptoms, once produced, can be quickly reversed by placing a paper sack over the subject's head and requiring him/her to rebreathe expired air. Overbreathing and CO2 challenges do not, however, produce full-blown hyperventilatory attacks in most individuals. That is, some individuals or \"types\" appear to be especially sensitive to the effects of overbreathing and/or CO2 loading.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibiity seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleo-vestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

All benzodiazepines possess dose-dependently anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsive properties. Likewise, the profile of side effects is almost identical, because all central actions of the benzodiazepines are based on a common molecular mechanism. CNS-depressant reactions, such as sedation, (hang-over) fatigue, ataxia, impairment of motor coordination and intellectual functions including memory (amnesia!) are most frequent, especially in the elderly if dosage has not been reduced accordingly. Rapid injection of higher doses should be avoided because these drugs (especially midazolam) can suppress ventilation.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

      "title": "#36946 Ketamine in acute and chronic pain",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Acute and chronic pain remains a significant health problem worldwide. The aging of the population has led to an increased number of individuals experiencing both acute injuries and chronic diseases that cause pain. Ketamine was originally developed by Craig Newlands and later synthesized by Calvin Stevens in 1962. It is a derivative of phenylcyclidine in order to produce a safer and more manageable drug. Recently there has been an increased interest about it especially in emergency medicine, acute and chronic pain and psychiatry. It is an analgesic imperative to maintain a balance between the adequate treatment of pain and preventing opiate dependence in the population. It is a 'dissociative anesthetic,' which refers to the fact that simultaneously different areas of the brain are either activated, such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex, or suppressed, such as the thalamus, and therefore the various areas of the brain are 'dissociated' from each other. It rapidly induces general anesthesia while preserving the patient's protective reflexes and vital functions besides its sympathomimetic effect. However, its psychomimetic effects have limited its use. Research in 1965 demonstrated its analgesic effect in subdissociative doses during painful procedures in children. In 1971, the analgesic effect of ketamine was further confirmed when it was observed that patients who underwent anesthesia with ketamine required less opioid medication and experienced better pain management. It is highy lipophilic with a distribution half-life of 10 min, onset time of 30 s, short duration of action after a bolus dose, large volume of distribution (160-550 litres) and it is least protein bound(10-50%). The liver metabolizes ketamine via the cytochromes CYP 2B6 and CYP3A4, producing (R, S)-norketamine, which is converted to 6-hydroxynorketamine and 5,6- dehydronorketamine. These metabolites have an extended half-life of up to 3 days and, according to various authors, provide prolonged analgesic and antidepressant effects. Bioavailability and duration of action vary depending on the route of administration: with intravenous administration, bioavailability is 100%. It is eliminated mainly in the urine (elimination half-life of 1,5-3 h) Women generally metabolize ketamine more rapidly (up to 20%) than men, whereas older people tend to metabolize it more slowly. It is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation. Due to its short half-life, no dosage adjustment is required in patients with impaired renal function. It has the ability to produce different effects depending on the dosage and this property is unique among drugs. Low-dose ketamine has been shown to have an opioid-sparing effect and has been shown to reduce opioid tolerance. In addition to its role as an analgesic in acute pain, it can reduce hyperalgesia and allodynia in chronic pain. The main mechanism of action of ketamine is to block glutamatergic neurons via its antagonistic effect on NMDA receptors. It does this by non-competitively blocking the opening of glutamatergic channels, mainly in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Ketamine also activates the prefrontal cortex via blockade of inhibitory interneurons, which is one of the mechanisms responsible for its psychomimetic effects. The effect of ketamine on NMDA receptors is unique in that it acts as an open-channel blocker. It blocks the calcium channels only when they are open and has no effect on the closed resting channel. However, the analgesic effects of ketamine are diverse and multifaceted. It modulates the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine and causes a paradoxical increase in glutamate with stimulation of the descending inhibitory pathways with effects on dopaminergic, adrenergic, serotoninergic, opioid and cholinergic receptors by stimulating the nicotinic pathway and inhibiting the muscarinic pathway by blocking M1 receptors. Ketamine also acts on spinal GABA interneurons. The blockade of NMDA receptors by ketamine is involved in reducing spinal cord exhaustion, which is a major contributor to the development of chronic pain. Severe pain activates NMDA receptors with hyperexcitability of spinal interneurons in the posterior horn, leading to spinal cord wind-up and central sensitisation. The paradoxical increase in glutamate is essential for the stimulation of medullary GABA inhibitors and for the stimulation of AMPA receptors, which are crucial for the control of depressive symptoms. Ketamine blocks the NMDA-Rs of GABAergic interneurons, leading to a paradoxical increase in extra- cellular glutamate and activation of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAr), which stimulates the mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) signalling pathway, particularly in cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons. Ketamine also has an anti-inflammatory effect by lowering the levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. In the past, great importance was placed on the analgesic role of ketamine metabolites, but this has since been revised. However, experimental evidence in animal models suggests that norketamine plays an essential role in hyperpolarizing the Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels(HCN) in the spinal cord and hippocampus, which is particularly important for antidepressant modulation by ketamine. However, in animal models, HCN receptors appear to be involved in the analgesic effect. The action of ketamine on opioid receptors does not appear to have a direct analgesic effect but does have a modulatory effect. Direct intrathecal antagonism of mu and delta receptors (but not kappa receptors) blocks the analgesic effect of ketamine, which is not affected by the parenteral administration of naloxone. It acts on sigma-1 receptors, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and voltage-gated sodium channels, but their exact functions and possible roles in analgesia are not yet known. Concerning chronic pain there is an interesting link between pain and depression: functional and neuroimaging studies have shown that ketamine reduces the activity of the insular cortex and thalamus, which are normally activated by pain. Although the effect of ketamine on NMDA-R receptors has not been fully elucidated, some observations have suggested that these receptors play a crucial role in the context of depression and chronic pain. Specifically, ketamine increases neuronal calcium via NMDA-R blockade, which causes a secondary decrease in NMDA-R receptors via gene depression, thereby increasing levels of brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are low in mouse models of induced depression and whose levels are increased by ketamine. In addition, ketamine has been shown to decrease receptor affinity for substance P, a neurotransmitter that increases in chronic pain and is one of the mechanisms underlying the loss of medullary pain inhibition. In addition, ketamine appears to block acetylcholine muscarinic receptors (m1ChRs), which may also play a role in modulating chronic pain. Studies suggest that agonists of these receptors may increase the pain threshold. In addition, animal studies have suggested that ketamine may modulate astrocytic and glial responses that also play a role in chronic neuropathic pain. It appears to have a stronger analgesic effect in patients with chronic pain and depression because it may interfere with the production of D-serine or glycine which are required by NMDA receptors in the medullary interneurons as co-agonists, especially in neurons in the limbic region involved in the development of depression and chronic pain. D-serine in medullary interneurons, increases during neuropathic pain, leading to the activation of NO synthase. Ketamine interacts with central and spinal opioid receptors and NMDA-R. Opiates reduce pain perception by activating mu receptors, but they activate NMDA receptors, leading to postsynaptic hyperexcitability, central tolerance, and sensitization. Ketamine has been shown to modulate and reduce these effects. It also exerts a downstream effect by increasing opioid-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal- regulated 1/2 kinase (ERK 1–2), so fewer opioids are required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect (opioid-sparing effect). This also helps reduce adverse events such as respiratory depression and vomiting. Ketamine is indicated for managing acute pain in patients with severe pain that is not responsive to standard opioid analgesics. It can be used safely in head injuries as it does not increase intracranial pressure. It is particularly useful in major surgery and especially when the nervous system is involved. Due to differences in the surgical setting, procedures, timing of administration and dosages, meta-analyses are difficult to compare, and a large study with 8000 participants has not yet been completed. In a recent systematic review, low-dose ketamine was comparable to morphine in analgesic effectiveness within 60 minutes of administration, with comparable safety profiles, when used in the emergency department. In 2018 the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists published the following consensus guidelines for the use of ketamine in the management of acute and chronic pain: When used for perioperative analgesia, ketamine bolus dose should not exceed 0.35 mg/kg, and infusion rate should not exceed 1 mg/kg/hr in non-intensive care settings. It should be avoided in patients with severe or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, severe liver disease, increased intracranial pressure, elevated intraocular pressure, pregnancy, and underlying psychiatric disease associated with psychosis. Evidence supporting patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with ketamine as the sole analgesic agent postoperatively is limited. For chronic regional pain syndromes (CRPS), there is moderate certainty evidence supporting the use of ketamine infusions for analgesia, which has been shown to provide pain relief for up to 12 weeks. For fibromyalgia, cancer pain, ischemic pain, migraine headache, and low-back pain, there is weak or no evidence to support the use of ketamine infusion for immediate pain relief. Oral ketamine is associated with high abuse potential and should be cautiously prescribed. Follow-up therapy (after intravenous ketamine infusion) with intra-nasal ketamine for breakthrough pain is supported by moderate certainty evidence and can be used in the appropriate population. For palliative therapies and the treatment of neoplastic pain, the evidence is still limited, as it is for the treatment of headache, but there is evidence of considerable interest. The optimal analgesic dosage of ketamine varies widely in the literature, ranging from 0.15 to 0.5 mg/kg. However, doses above 0.3 mg/kg can lead to psychomimetic symptoms, and 0.5 mg/kg is considered a subdissociative dose and is associated with a higher rate of adverse events. As a result, many authors define safe and effective analgesic dosing as 0.15–0.3 mg/kg bolus, 0.15–0.3 mg/kg/h continuous infusion, 0.5–1 mg/kg intramuscular administration, and 1 mg/kg intranasal administration. Oral administration of ketamine is not standardized, but doses of 0.5 mg/kg every 12 h are considered effective. Other possible routes of administration include transdermal (25 mg/24 h), subcutaneous (0.05–0.15 mg/kg/h), and rectal (10 mg/kg). The administration method can be tailored to the clinical setting: Continuous infusion administration (up to 100 hours) takes advantage of the increased levels of ketamine metabolites and their analgesic and antidepressant properties. Infusions (up to 100 h) resulted in a sustained analgesic response of 4 to 8 weeks, while infusions of 12 to 24 h resulted in a reduced but stable response of 7 to 10 days. Ketamine is an excellent drug for the treatment of severe pain in acute cases, but also has remarkable benefits in chronic pain infusions. Unfortunately, there is currently no clinical evidence to predict individual patient responses. Identifying clinical factors that can predict a patient's response to ketamine will help clinicians determine the most appropriate treatment option. So rigorous research is still needed. Given the opioid crisis, such studies are more urgent than ever. Future research should also investigate ketamine enantiomers and the development of molecules with more targeted analgesic effects and fewer psychomimetic side effects. Nevertheless, all healthcare providers involved in the treatment of acute, chronic, neuropathic, or neoplastic pain need to be aware of this treatment option and be able to manage its unique side effects. <h3>References</h3> Alessandro Riccardi, <i>et al</i>.

General anaesthesia and surgery have been previously reported as precipitating factors for functional disorders and mostly involve dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures. We report a patient with no psychiatric history or prior abnormal examination who developed sudden onset functional tetraplegia and sensory disturbances immediately after elective surgery, and who was subsequently discharged home several days later after nearly complete resolution of neurologic deficits. We highlight the features of this syndrome, including its unique postoperative presentation, unusual resolution and absence of any identifiable psycho-dynamic mechanism. We also introduce the tripod sign as a useful clinical tool in identifying functional tetraplegia.",

Behaviour may be a mediating variable in experiencing job-related stress in law enforcement, and among dispatchers, in particular.

      "abstract": "In the seventies and eighties spinal mechanisms inhibiting pain processing were discovered in animal studies leading to new therapeutic regimens such the use of spinal opioids. During the last decade additional studies revealed an increased sensibility of the spinal cord upon severe, long lasting pain perception, a mechanism called wind-up. Hyperalgesia is accompanied by persisting genetic changes of spinal cord cells, which may contribute to the chronification of pain. The severity and duration of acute pain apparently contributes to the possibility of chronic pain development. Although not all the consequences of these findings are clear, they may influence our way of performing anaesthesia and treating postoperative or acute pain situations, e.g. pain during herpes zoster or pain after trauma and amputation. In general, analgetic measures should be potent enough to prevent spinal sensiblisation, which can be best achieved with spinal blockade by local anesthetics. Another way of counteracting pain-induced spinal plasticity is by blocking or antagonizing its pathways with specific transmitters or their equivalents. All these spinally mediated regimens should be performed prior to later predominating mechanisms of supraspinal plasticity involving psychic changes due to persisting pain, which seem to evolve with delay to spinal processes.",

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

      "title": "Review: Cholinergic mechanisms and epileptogenesis. The seizures induced by pilocarpine: A novel experimental model of intractable epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract High‐dose treatment with pilocarpine hydrochloride, a cholinergic muscarinic agonist, induces seizures in rodents following systemic or intracerebral administration. Pilocarpine seizures are characterized by a sequential development of behavioral patterns and electrographic activity. Hypoactivity, tremor, scratching, head bobbing, and myoclonic movements of the limbs progress to recurrent myoclonic convulsions with rearing, salivation, and falling, and status epilepticus. The sustained convulsions induced by pilocarpine are followed by widespread damage to the forebrain. The amygdala, thalamus, olfactory cortex, hippocampus, neocortex, and substantia nigra are the most sensitive regions to epilepsy‐related damage following convulsions produced by pilocarpine. Spontaneous seizures are observed in the long‐term period following the administration of convulsant doses of pilocarpine. Developmental studies show age‐dependent differences in the response of rats to pilocarpine. Seizures are first noted in 7–12 day‐old rats, and the adult pattern of behavioral and electroencephalographic sequelae of pilocarpine is seen in 15–21‐day‐old rats. During the third week of life the rats show an increased susceptibility to the convulsant action of pilocarpine relative to older and younger animals. The developmental progress of the convulsive response to pilocarpine does not correlate with evolution of the brain damage. The adult pattern of the damage is seen after a delay of 1–2 weeks in comparison with the evolution of seizures and status epilepticus. The susceptibility to seizures induced by pilocarpine increases in rats aged over 4 months. The basal ganglia curtail the generation and spread of seizures induced by pilocarpine. The caudate putamen, the substantia nigra, and the entopeduncular nucleus govern the propagation of pilocarpine‐induced seizures. The antiepileptic drugs diazepam, clonazepam, phenobarbital, valproate, and trimethadione protect against pilocarpine‐induced convulsions, while diphenylhydantoin and carbamazepine are ineffective. Ethosuximide and acetazolamide increase the suspectibility to convulsant action of pilocarpine. Lithium, morphine, and aminophylline also increase the susceptibility of rats to pilocarpine seizures. The pilocarpine seizure model may be of value in designing new therapeutic approaches to epilepsy.",

Lesions of the brain stem or the hypothalamus are known to be associated frequently with pyrexia.1Typhoid vaccine and other foreign protein agents cause fever probably by functional alterations in the central nervous system.2Whether this effect occurs by virtue of changes in circulation or by direct chemical action on cells of the thermoregulatory apparatus is not yet clear. Even less clear is the mechanism responsible for elevations of body temperature accompanying emotional disturbances. The fact that they do occur, however, has long been known. Most of the writing on the subject has appeared in the German literature.

      "title": "Care of the AIDS patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Treatment of the person dying from AIDS requires attention to the biological, psychological, and social aspects of the patient. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions must be appropriate for the stage of the illness, the wishes of the patient, and the risk-benefit ratio of each particular situation. Symptom management requires familiarity with the multiple problems seen in persons with AIDS (PWA). Optimal treatment of any symptom requires accurate diagnosis. Pain occurs in PWA in approximately 53% of patients. Common causes of pain include nonspecific muscle aches; headache due to lymphoma or, more often, to direct infection of the brain with HIV or parasites; localized or diffuse lymphade-nopathy; peripheral neuropathy; esophagitis; and skin problems. Treatment of the underlying etiology, if possible, is the first consideration. Symptomatic pain relief proceeds in a stepwise fashion, beginning with a peripherally acting analgesic (e.g., acetaminophen or NSAID) and adding, not substituting, a narcotic analgesic in increasing doses and/or potency until pain control is achieved. Breathlessness may be due to a treatabl infection. Other causes may not be amenable to specific intervention but do require symptom management, which involves the liberal use of oxygen, bronchodilator (if bronchospasm is present), and, at times, low doses of narcotics. Oropharyngeal lesions due to Candida respond to clotrimazole troches, nystatin, or ketoconozole. Candida esophagitis usually responds to ketoconozole but occasionally requires low-dose amphotericin B. Diarrhea is usually treated symptomatically with loperamide, Lomotil, oral morphine, or deodorized tincture of opium. Neuropsychiatric problems have become the dominant problem in the terminal care of PWA. Depression may be organic or may be a psychological reaction to the diagnosis or to disease progression. Antidepressant medications carefully titrated are often helpful. Dementia occurs in over 65% of patients. Early signs may be subtle. Many patients become severely impaired by dementia. Environmental change and social adaptation remain the mainstays of treatment, but pharmacologic interventions with low doses of haloperidol may improve some behaviors, such as restlessness, agitation, sleeplessness, emotional lability, and hallucinations. Delirium usually is a sign of superimposed metabolic or infectious insult. Treatment requires reversing the underlying cause, but haloperidol may provide symptomatic relief. Psychosocial issues for AIDS patients are similar to those for any dying patient. However, isolation is more common and often includes the biological family of origin. Certain risk groups of patients may be considered undesirable. Too often patients have no primary care providers, inadequate housing, inadequate financial resources, and no health insurance. This paper addressed these issues in greater detail and provides a framework for working with patients, families, and caregivers.",

Usually this technique is considered as safe and short of psychiatric side effects, except for sometimes seen changes in frontal executive functions and transient postoperative depression. We report a 58-year-old patient with a 14 year history of Idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Due to severe L-Dopa-Induced dyskinesias and motor fluctuations the patient was deep brain stimulated in the Nc. subthalamicus. During intraoperative macrostimulation the patient developed sudden severe existential anxiety together with vegetative dysregulation for no obvious reason. After ending the test stimulation the anxiety vanished within a few seconds. This phenomenon was reproducible in another test stimulation. Using the next apical lead resulted in good symptom control considering IPD with no obvious side effects at first sight. During the next half-year the patient developed a fixed passiveness, loss of interest, apathy and loss of humor very unusual for him considering the preoperative state. The symptoms extended the sometimes seen mild transient postoperative dysthymia considering severity as well as duration of symptoms. Treatment with SSRI's led to no improvement of mental situation. A reprogramming of the neurostimulator, now using an even further apical lead resulted in a sudden and complete vanishing of the depressive symptoms within a few minutes. The now used lead still provides good symptom control, but without side effects with regard to mood.",

      "abstract": "Depression has surpassed HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war as the leading cause of disability and economic burden worldwide. It is the most common psychiatric disorder in developed countries. Another major public health issue is chronic pain. In Europe, pain is the most common cause for people to use healthcare resources. Nevertheless, there are no universally accepted treatment guidelines for treating chronic pain. The well-known anaesthetic agent ketamine appears as an interesting and promising management drug for both conditions. A single dose of ketamine alleviates depressive symptoms within minutes in patients who have failed to respond to two or more conventional antidepressants and these effects are sustained for one week to months. Ketamine is also effective for bipolar depression, it decreases suicidal ideation and has shown positive results in the treatment of other mental conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Furthermore, ketamine has shown antidepressant effects in patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy. Therefore, the off-label use of ketamine (i.e. using it for different purposes than anaesthesia) is increasingly common in the medical setting. In order to treat patients who are refractory to depression and chronic pain treatments, healthcare professionals are claiming compassionate reasons to obtain the authorisation to use ketamine as an antidepressant and/or analgesic. However, ketamine is a mood enhancer and its hedonistic use is widespread. Under medical surveillance and based in growing scientific evidence, the current psychedelic renaissance is bringing a new paradigm in the treatment of different types of disorders.",

Apart from drug rashes (discussed in the previous chapter), these idiosyncratic reactions can include hepatic, pancreatic, hematologic, neurologic, immunologic, or central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. These reactions can be unpredictable, but when they do occur, these typically arise within weeks of drug initiation and may be reversed when the drug is stopped. The management of idiosyncratic reactions depends on the manifestations and severity. Potentially life-threatening reactions warrant rapid drug discontinuation, with initiation of an alternative ASM with little cross-reactivity to prevent seizures. Other reactions can be managed with slower substitutions or with the addition of other drugs.",

As a consequence, neurotoxicity is one of the drug’s major side effects. The risk of neurotoxicity depends on dose, duration and schedule of paclitaxel. Risk increases for patients with pre-existing conditions that may cause neuropathy (such as alcohol consumption, diabetes, or renal disease) or with simultaneous or prior exposure to other neurotoxic chemotherapy such as platinum-based drugs, vinca alkaloids, immunomodulators, proteasome inhibitors, and epothilones. Patients with paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity (PINT) experience a constellation of symptoms over the course of treatment and beyond, ranging from mild to severe. Typically, the clinical presentation reflects an axonal peripheral neuropathy with glove-and-stocking distribution sensory loss, combined with features suggestive of nerve hyperexcitability including paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain. Proprioceptive and motor effects become apparent as neuropathy becomes more advanced. These symptoms may be prolonged, severe, disabling, relatively resistant to intervention and adversely affect activities of daily living and thereby quality of life. Management is mainly symptomatic and supportive. Despite attempts to minimize PINT with changes in dose, vehicle, delivery systems, infusion schedule and premedication or co-treatment with neuroprotective agents, PINT remains dose-limiting in many instances and is a barrier to achieving the desired clinical response.",

      "title": "Remission-Oriented Treatment of Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Given the wide variety of available antidepressant therapies, an important question is how effective are we in treating depression? In clinical research trials of antidepressants, a treatment response is defined as a 50% or greater improvement in depressive symptoms, whereas remission is defined as having minimal or absent symptoms at the end of treatment. Approximately 50% of patients treated with antidepressants have a treatment response, but only about 25% have a complete remission. Many treatment responders therefore have residual symptoms despite adequate treatment. This is critically important because depressed patients with residual symptoms, even though mild in severity, still have significant functional impairment, have a high risk of relapsing into a more severe episode, and may have a more chronic course of illness. Such patients also do not show a full functional recovery from their depression. Recent comparative studies have found that remission rates are significantly higher with venlafaxine (Effexor) compared to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which might be due to their different effects on neurotransmitter systems. The use of medication combinations, having additive and/or synergistic antidepressant effects, or adding psychotherapy following a course of pharmacotherapy also can be used to treat residual symptoms and lead to a more complete remission.",

For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

      "abstract": "To answer some of the questions surrounding the medicinal use of narcotic analgesics in advanced cancer, a group of 500 patients admitted to St Christopher's Hospice was reviewed. To achieve and maintain pain relief many of the patients received diamorphine (heroin) regularly every four hours. Almost all the patients received a phenothiazine concurrently; other drugs were prescribed when indicated. It was concluded that: 1) Although most patients receive parenteral diamorphine during the last 12 to 24 hours, the majority can be maintained on oral medication until this time. 2) There is no single optimal dose of diamorphine. 3) Psychological dependence does not occur. 4) Physical dependence may develop but does not prevent the downward adjustment of the dose of diamorphine when considered clinically feasible. 5) Tolerance is not a practical problem. 6) The prescription of diamorphine does not, by itself, lead to impairment of mental faculties. Also discussed are: 1) the psychobiological nature of pain; 2) the rational use of analgesics; 3) the need for further research; 4) the importance of the doctor's attitude.",

Would the addition of other therapy assist, for example amantadine, anticholinergics or bromocriptine? Is the patient on other drugs which may be contributing to the impaired function?

This is a particular problem in the treatment of depression, both because of the controversy over the division of depression into endogenous and reactive illnesses and because of the increasing use of the antidepressant drugs. These drugs will induce a remission in many patients, and will alter the clinical picture in others. As their use becomes still more widespread (Freyhan (1) has recommended that intensive imipramine treatment should be tried routinely before E.C.T. in all depressed patients) there may be further difficulties in the selection of depressed patients likely to respond well to E.C.T. Furthermore several recent reviews draw attention to a reduction in the use of E.C.T., and the lack of a consistent rationale for its use (2–4).",

In the last 20 years, the use of opioids for the management of chronic, non-malignant pain states, such as painful neuropathic conditions, and for recurring headaches has been steadily increasing. Because of increased long-term opioid therapies, there is a greater awareness that the prolonged exposure to opioids may result in a paradoxic enhanced pain state. Consequently, the notion that employing long-term opioid protocols might unwittingly cause harm to the patient has become a clinical concern. The commonly reported observations that aggressive analgesic therapy paradoxically results in increased frequency and intensity of the headaches may represent a manifestation of the development of opioid induced abnormal pain.",

The clinical picture may for a long time be dominated by disturbances of posture and gait (the myostatic phase of Wechsler and Brock<sup>2</sup>) before muscular restlessness becomes evident. Such cases do not even suggest dystonia and therefore are usually labeled hysteria, chorea, athetosis or some other form of muscular restlessness. Because dystonia resembles some other clinical manifestations, there is a tendency to discard it as a clinical entity. According to others, dystonia not only is a clinical entity but exhibits definite pathologic changes in some basal ganglions—caudate nucleus and putamen (corpus striatum).

Multidisciplinary treatment combining pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies is advised.Areas covered: Publications describing randomized controlled trials and long-term extension studies evaluating drug treatment for fibromyalgia were searched in PubMed and Scopus and included in this review.Expert opinion: Different drugs are recommended for the treatment of fibromyalgia by different published guidelines, although only three of them have been approved for this indication by the US FDA, and none have been approved by the European Medicines Agency. According to the available evidence, pregabalin, duloxetine and milnacipran should be the drugs of choice for the treatment of this disease, followed by amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine. Other drugs with at least one positive clinical trial include some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, moclobemide, pirlindole, gabapentin, tramadol, tropisetron, sodium oxybate and nabilone. None of the currently available drugs are fully effective against the whole spectrum of fibromyalgia symptoms, namely pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances and depression, among the most relevant symptoms. Combination therapy is an option that needs to be more thoroughly investigated in clinical trials.",

      "title": "A survey of peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) use",
      "abstract": "EDITOR: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants retain a vital place in anaesthetic practice. The number of available muscle relaxants has increased in recent years. All of these drugs vary in speed of onset, duration of action and in speed of offset. The manufacturers produce guidance for the use of these drugs in the form of data sheets. These may give recommendations for initial dose, speed of onset and duration of action. Clinical practice is however, likely to vary considerably with the manufacturer's guidance for the following reasons: 1. Variable individual response to muscle relaxants. Marked variation has been shown between healthy individuals for the same dose of muscle relaxant [1] 2. Renal function. Impaired renal function may prolong the duration of action. 3. Liver disease or reduced hepatic blood flow. These may prolong the duration of action. 4. Electrolyte disturbances. These may prolong the duration of action. 5. Other drugs. Aminoglycosides prolong the duration of action, other drugs may also affect the duration of action. 6. Obesity. Dose requirements are affected with variation between the different muscle relaxants. Knowledge about the state of neuromuscular blockade is important from induction through to recovery. Inadequate neuromuscular blockade during the procedure may make surgery difficult, and has the potential to be extremely dangerous to the patient. At the end of the procedure there is the potential for an awake patient with residual paralysis or for recurarization during the recovery period. Residual neuromuscular blockade may increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [2]. The peripheral nerve stimulator is not the perfect monitor; it measures neuromuscular function in the periphery, which is more sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants than is diaphragmatic muscle [3]. It may give an inaccurate test due to poor electrical contact or incorrect placement. At present, it is the most common monitor of neuromuscular function. This is due to its simplicity, ease of use, portability and cost. We have undertaken a survey to establish current practice in respect of PNS usage at five hospitals. We aimed to assess use and availability of the PNS. We also wanted to identify the factors which influence PNS usage, such as duration of anaesthesia and the muscle relaxant used. A questionnaire was sent to all grades of anaesthetist at five hospitals. Three teaching hospitals and two district general hospitals. The questionnaire asked a number of questions about PNS usage. One hundred questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 57%, of these, replies were from consultants (48%), from training grades (48%) and from other grades (4%). Question 1: Is there a place for using a peripheral nerve stimulator while using a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in your practice? Yes 89% No 11% Question 2: If a PNS is available in the theatre, how often do you use it? Never 8% Sometimes 74% Always 17% Question 3: Will you use a peripheral nerve stimulator if the duration of operation is less than 20 min, 20-40 min, 40-60 min and over 60 min? (Table 1)Table 1: Use of PNS with duration of operation Question 4: How often is a peripheral nerve stimulator available? (Table 2)Table 2: Availability of PNS in theatre (%) Question 5: How often do you use a peripheral nerve stimulator with different muscle relaxants? (Table 3)Table 3: Use of PNS with particular relaxants as percentage The response rate of 57% was disappointing but did show some marked differences. The large majority of anaesthetists (89%) in our survey have a need for a peripheral nerve stimulator in their practice. Most use it for selected cases, with a small group using it for all cases in whom a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is used (17%). This survey found that a factor affecting usage was the duration of anaesthesia with the number of anaesthetists always using a PNS rising from 11% for operations of 20-40 min duration to 21% always using a PNS for operations of 40-60 min. This may reflect the fact that an induction dose of muscle relaxant will often last between 20 and 40 min, but repeat doses are likely if the duration exceeds 40 min. There appeared to be a relation between the choice of muscle relaxant and the duration of drug action, with the least use for the short-acting mivacurium and most use for the long-acting pancuronium. It was interesting to find no increase in PNS use for the newer agents. This may reflect their predictability, although there are reports of recurarization with rocuronium [4]. It is of concern that in some hospitals there are insufficient nerve stimulators. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland recommends that a means of assessing neuromuscular block should be available whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are used [5]. In the case of one teaching hospital, 40% of respondents reported that peripheral nerve stimulators were 'rarely available' or 'never available'. While their use is not mandatory they should be readily available in every theatre complex. The results of this survey were presented to this hospital and have resulted in the provision of four extra peripheral nerve stimulators for the theatre complex. The use of the PNS helps with anaesthetic training and with the introduction of new or modified muscle relaxants but above all it may improve anaesthetic standards by preventing over- or under-curarization.

One hundred questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 57%, of these, replies were from consultants (48%), from training grades (48%) and from other grades (4%). Question 1: Is there a place for using a peripheral nerve stimulator while using a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant in your practice? Yes 89% No 11% Question 2: If a PNS is available in the theatre, how often do you use it? Never 8% Sometimes 74% Always 17% Question 3: Will you use a peripheral nerve stimulator if the duration of operation is less than 20 min, 20-40 min, 40-60 min and over 60 min? (Table 1)Table 1: Use of PNS with duration of operation Question 4: How often is a peripheral nerve stimulator available? (Table 2)Table 2: Availability of PNS in theatre (%) Question 5: How often do you use a peripheral nerve stimulator with different muscle relaxants? (Table 3)Table 3: Use of PNS with particular relaxants as percentage The response rate of 57% was disappointing but did show some marked differences. The large majority of anaesthetists (89%) in our survey have a need for a peripheral nerve stimulator in their practice. Most use it for selected cases, with a small group using it for all cases in whom a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant is used (17%). This survey found that a factor affecting usage was the duration of anaesthesia with the number of anaesthetists always using a PNS rising from 11% for operations of 20-40 min duration to 21% always using a PNS for operations of 40-60 min. This may reflect the fact that an induction dose of muscle relaxant will often last between 20 and 40 min, but repeat doses are likely if the duration exceeds 40 min. There appeared to be a relation between the choice of muscle relaxant and the duration of drug action, with the least use for the short-acting mivacurium and most use for the long-acting pancuronium. It was interesting to find no increase in PNS use for the newer agents. This may reflect their predictability, although there are reports of recurarization with rocuronium [4]. It is of concern that in some hospitals there are insufficient nerve stimulators. The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland recommends that a means of assessing neuromuscular block should be available whenever neuromuscular blocking drugs are used [5]. In the case of one teaching hospital, 40% of respondents reported that peripheral nerve stimulators were 'rarely available' or 'never available'. While their use is not mandatory they should be readily available in every theatre complex. The results of this survey were presented to this hospital and have resulted in the provision of four extra peripheral nerve stimulators for the theatre complex. The use of the PNS helps with anaesthetic training and with the introduction of new or modified muscle relaxants but above all it may improve anaesthetic standards by preventing over- or under-curarization. We are grateful to Dr Hugh James and audit secretary Dawn Burt for their help in carrying out this survey. J. SHAH O. OWEN-SMITH S.

      "title": "Psilocybin as an antidepressant strategy - a review of safety aspects",
      "abstract": "Introduction Psilocybin is considered a classical psychedelic and is increasingly attracting scientific and media attention as an alternative approach to the treatment of various mental disorders. Apart from its efficacy, an important question is the tolerability and safety of psilocybin in general and in a controlled environment. Accurate knowledge of drug safety aspects might be essential for applicability in clinical practice and for drug adherence. Objectives This paper aims to provide an overview of drug safety aspects of psilocybin. Methods A narrative review was conducted. The literature search was conducted using the bibliographic database MEDLINE. Results The literature search of papers published in recent years showed no serious side effects under psilocybin in controlled study conditions. Common reported ADRs were headache, gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting, tachycardia and arterial hypertension. The lethal dose of psilocybin is many times higher than the therapeutic dose and overdose deaths have not been identified. An often mentioned problem is the occurrence of hallucinogenic persisting perception disorder (HPPD) which, however, did not occur in the studies examined and is most likely to be a problem in the context of recreational use. The results on the safety of psilocybin must be regarded as preliminary; in the studies conducted, risk populations were predominantly excluded, which is, however, relevant for everyday clinical practice. The risk of delusional experiences and so-called “bad trips” is also a relevant safety risk, as it can be associated with risky behaviours. However, these would also be observed more in the area of recreational use. Conclusions The use of psilocybin in rigorously controlled study designs appears to be predominantly safe and without serious side effects. At the same time, it should be noted that the results must be considered preliminary and many questions remain open. Many of the risks are more likely to occur in uncontrolled recreational use of psilocybin. At the same time, we see a certain risk in the use of a substance associated with high expectations and a certain “fame” that, without appropriate regulations, the boundaries between sensible therapeutic use and abusive use could become blurred and permeable.

      "title": "Sympathetic Overstimulation During Critical Illness: Adverse Effects of Adrenergic Stress",
      "abstract": "The term ‘‘adrenergic’’ originates from ‘‘adrenaline’’ and describes hormones or drugs whose effects are similar to those of epinephrine. Adrenergic stress is mediated by stimulation of adrenergic receptors and activation of post-receptor pathways. Critical illness is a potent stimulus of the sympathetic nervous system. It is undisputable that the adrenergic-driven ‘‘fight-flight response’’ is a physiologically meaningful reaction allowing humans to survive during evolution. However, in critical illness an overshooting stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system may well exceed in time and scope its beneficial effects. Comparable to the overwhelming immune response during sepsis, adrenergic stress in critical illness may get out of control and cause adverse effects. Several organ systems may be affected. The heart seems to be most susceptible to sympathetic overstimulation. Detrimental effects include impaired diastolic function, tachycardia and tachyarrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, stunning, apoptosis and necrosis. Adverse catecholamine effects have been observed in other organs such as the lungs (pulmonary edema, elevated pulmonary arterial pressures), the coagulation (hypercoagulability, thrombus formation), gastrointestinal (hypoperfusion, inhibition of peristalsis), endocrinologic (decreased prolactin, thyroid and growth hormone secretion) and immune systems (immunomodulation, stimulation of bacterial growth), and metabolism (increase in cell energy expenditure, hyperglycemia, catabolism, lipolysis, hyperlactatemia, electrolyte changes), bone marrow (anemia), and skeletal muscles (apoptosis). Potential therapeutic options to reduce excessive adrenergic stress comprise temperature and heart rate control, adequate use of sedative/analgesic drugs, and aiming for reasonable cardiovascular targets, adequate fluid therapy, use of levosimendan, hydrocortisone or supplementary arginine vasopressin.",

      "title": "Epilepsy, cognition, and behavior: The clinical picture",
      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

Many patients, however, after years of levodopa therapy at doses needed to control parkinsonism, are disabled by dyskinesias or psychoses. Others experience a progressive shortening of levodopa's effect (reduced \"on\" time) after each dose or sudden, freezing episodes (the \"on/off\" phenomenon) not related to dose. These therapeutic difficulties have encouraged a search for other antiparkinsonian agents. Because the primary neurohumoral defect in patients with Parkinson disease is loss of striatal dopamine, much research has focused on direct-acting dopamine agonists.Pergolide mesylate, a synthetic cousin of...References1.

This article reviews the clinical effects and treatment of persons who use cocaine, methamphetamines, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), synthetic cannabinoids, and synthetic cathinones (\"bath salts\"). Cocaine blocks the reuptake of the monoamine transporters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Immediate clinical effects include increased energy and euphoria, as well as hypertension and arrhythmias. Acute myocardial infarction, seizures, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and movement disorders are among the possible adverse effects. Like cocaine, methamphetamine blocks reuptake of monoamine transporters, but also stimulates dopamine release and has a longer duration of action. Methamphetamine misuse is associated with severe dental problems. MDMA is a stimulant and psychedelic with a chemical structure similar to serotonin. Adverse effects include serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, long-term memory impairment, and mood disorders. Synthetic cannabinoids can have a more intense and long-lasting effect than natural cannabis. Acute intoxication may cause severe cardiac and respiratory complications and seizures. Synthetic cathinones are marketed as cheap substitutes for other stimulants. Their effects are similar to those of other stimulants, and they are addictive. Psychosocial intervention is the main form of treatment for addiction to these substances. Promising therapies include disulfiram and substitution therapy for cocaine misuse disorders, and mirtazapine for methamphetamine use disorder.",

According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

      "title": "The pharmacological management of neuropathic pain",
      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain has recently been defined as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system\". Neuropathic pain is a debilitating chronic condition that remains very difficult to treat and challenging to manage. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitryptiline, nortriptyline, imipramine), selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine, venlafaxine), anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin), and 5% lidocaine patches have demonstrated efficacy in neuropathic pain and are recommended as first-line medications. In patients who fail to respond to these first-line medications alone and/or in combination, opioid analgesics or tramadol can be used as a second-line treatment alone or in combination with one of the first-line medications. Opioid analgesics and tramadol can also be considered for first-line use in selected clinical circumstances. Other pharmacological therapeutic options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiepileptic drugs (levetiracetam, lacosamide, lamotrigine, valproic acid), cannabinoids, high concentration capsaicin patch, and botulinum toxin A. Medication selection should be individualized, with side effects taken into consideration as well as potential beneficial or deleterious effects on comorbidities, and whether or not prompt onset of pain relief is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease, with physical exercise being a widely endorsed strategy in its management guidelines. Exerkines, defined as cytokines secreted in response to acute and chronic exercise, function through endocrine, paracrine, and/or autocrine pathways. Various tissue-specific exerkines, encompassing exercise-induced myokines (muscle), cardiokines (heart), and adipokines (adipose tissue), have been linked to exercise therapy in OA. Exerkines are derived from these kines, but unlike them, only kines regulated by exercise can be called exerkines. Some of these exerkines serve a therapeutic role in OA, such as irisin, metrnl, lactate, secreted frizzled-related protein (SFRP), neuregulin, and adiponectin. While others may exacerbate the condition, such as IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-33, myostatin, fractalkine, follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), visfatin, activin A, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), apelin and growth differentiation factor (GDF)-15. They exerts anti-/pro-apoptosis/pyroptosis/inflammation, chondrogenic differentiation and cell senescence effect in chondrocyte, synoviocyte and mesenchymal stem cell. The modulation of adipokine effects on diverse cell types within the intra-articular joint emerges as a promising avenue for future OA interventions. This paper reviews recent findings that underscore the significant role of tissue-specific exerkines in OA, delving into the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved.",

      "title": "Psychedelics: The New Kid on the Block",
      "abstract": "HISTORY In the early part of twentieth century, these molecules were known as psychotomimetics, meaning that they create a state similar to psychosis. Later on, they were also termed as hallucinogens, but psychedelics usually do not cause hallucinations at a therapeutic dose. The name psychedelics for these substances was first given by Osmond in 1957, meaning that they reveal useful or beneficial properties of the mind.[1] However, the idea that psychedelics can have beneficial effects has had mixed response till recently among the medical fraternity. Psychedelics strictly mean substances that alter perception, mood, and consciousness by acting on brain 5-HT2A receptors mainly as an agonist in the layer 5 of pyramidal cells in the cortex. This definition excludes other agents such as cannabinoids, dissociative agents such as ketamine, and entactogens such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, although all of them may cause hallucination, but their mechanism of action is different. The classic serotonin psychedelics such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) cause brain processes that are significantly different compared with normal consciousness[2] mainly by reducing between-network synchrony and increasing the connectivity between brain networks. These changes in integrative functions of the brain may be demonstrated using investigations such as electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography synchrony (decreased) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity (increased).[2] The effect on brain connectivity is long lasting and may persist for months after single use. Contrary to popular belief, psychedelics do not produce physical dependence or withdrawal on repeated use. PSYCHEDELICS AS TREATMENT Use of plant-based psychedelics like psilocybin or eyote in religious/ritualistic practices has an ancient history particularly in the American continent.[3] Psilocybin mushrooms were used by the Aztec shaman in healing and in a variety of religious rituals. Peyote (Lophophora williamsii) is a small cactus found mainly in the South America and Northern Mexico that has been used since ancient times and is consumed as a sacrament during services of the Native American Church. Psychedelics are an exceptional category of mind-altering substances and has been in use in various cultures as Sacrament.[4,5] In this regard, Jaffe[6] has given a highly revered definition of psychedelics \"…The feature that distinguishes the psychedelic agents from other classes of drug is their capacity reliably to induce states of altered perception, thought, and feeling that are not experienced otherwise except in dreams or at times of religious exaltation.\" Psychedelics played a substantial role in defining the youth culture of the 1960s and 1970s. The powerful psychological effect of LSD was accidently discovered in 1943 by Hofmann,[7] after 10 years of LSD discovery the detection of serotonin in the mammalian brain was done by Twarog and Page in 1953.[8] The discovery of LSD has greatly influenced the research in the field of Serotonin Neuroscience. One of the eminent LSD researchers[8] noted that \"…One basic dimension of behavior… compellingly revealed in LSD states is \"Portentousness\" which is the capacity of the mind to see more than it can tell…. to believe in more than it can rationally justify, to experience boundlessness and \"Boundaryless\" events, from the banal to the profound.\" The word entheogen has been coined as a substitute for psychedelic to reduce the negative overtone. The word entheogen usually means a substance or material that generates God or the divine within someone. However, the effects produced by psychedelics are highly dependent on the set (mental expectation) of the user and the setting (environment).[9] RESEARCH WITH PSYCHEDELICS The initial research into psychedelics was done by the American and European physicians with peyote (Mescaline). Mescaline was identified in 1894 by the German chemist Arthur Heffter, then synthesized in 1919 by the Austrian chemist Ernst Späth. This opened the gate for Medical Research in psychedelics in North America and Europe. As early as in 1934, French psychiatrists Henri Claude suggested the possibility of using mescaline for the treatment of depression.[10] The discovery of the effects of the LSD in 1943 and the rediscovery of Mexican divinatory mushrooms in 1953 led to extensive medical research on psychedelics.[11] However, by 1960s, the research in psychedelics drastically declined due to various factors like anti-war demonstration by so-called hippies who used to abuse LSD, rejection of conventional social norms by adolescents and college students, public hysteria concerning drug-induced insanity, and experiments conducted at a renowned US university without institutional approval.[12] Interestingly, since the late 1980s, there was a gradual increasing interest in psychedelics with numerous publications in the field of neurobiology and neuroscience of psychedelics, which has been termed as \"Psychedelic renaissance.\"[13] Initial clinical trials focused on the benefits of psilocybin to reduce anxiety and improve the mood of patients with cancer.[14] In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial, they investigated the effects of a very low dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) versus a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up in 51 cancer patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in measures of depressed mood and anxiety, improved quality of life, increased optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were maintained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety.[14] Many researchers have tested psychedelics in conjunction with psychotherapy for the treatment of anxiety and depression. A study compared psilocybin with escitalopram over a 6-week period in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder in a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 59 patients were enrolled: 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. All the subjects received psychotherapy. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self-Report. At the end of 6 weeks, there was no significant difference in the antidepressant effects between escitalopram and psilocybin.[15] In a recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression, a single dose of ayahuasca was compared against placebo.[16] Improvement in depression was assessed with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale at baseline, at 1, 2, and 7 days after dosing. Significant antidepressant effects of ayahuasca were seen when compared with placebo at all-time points. Ayahuasca is a brew that contains the psychedelic DMT and Harmine (RMAOi). This was a unique study which assessed the efficacy of a single-dose psychedelic in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Researchers have also investigated the effects of psilocybin in addiction disorders. Researchers conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess the effects of psilocybin in alcohol-dependent participants. Ten volunteers received orally administered psilocybin in one or two supervised sessions along with Motivational Enhancement Therapy. Abstinence increased significantly following psilocybin administration (P < 0.05) and was maintained at follow-up to 36 weeks. The magnitude of effects in the first psilocybin session also predicted decreases in craving. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events.[17] Since DMT can induce a rapid (3–5 min) intense altered state of consciousness with a sense of being transported to an alternative world, without any disturbances in wakefulness which subsides within 15–20 min, it is a very useful molecule to study consciousness. In a recent landmark study, they assessed the effects of single bolus dose of 20 mg intravenous DMT on human brain by doing simultaneous fMRI and EEG before (8 min prior), during, and after the DMT dose (20 min) on 20 healthy volunteers in a within group placebo controlled, pseudo-randomized setting. The fMRI results correlated with significant increases in global functional connectivity, network disintegration, and desegregation. DMT was associated with decrease modularity, especially for frontoparietal, salience, and default-mode networks. Analyses of EEG activity revealed widespread decreases in alpha under DMT and increases in both delta and gamma bands. The major finding of the study was dysregulation of activity in the brain's transmodal association cortex pole (TOP), so that TOP becomes less segregated from or more integrated with the rest of the cortex. This implies that brain functions mainly in entropic mode under psychedelics which may be the reason for their distinct phenomenology. This multimodal, multivariate EEG-fMRI study with DMT revealed a robust dysregulating effect on activity in the brain's TOP with increased communication between the TOP of the cortex and the rest of the brain. This may be interpreted as evidence of increased information processing and a hyper-associative style of cognition.[18] Researchers performed a scientometric analysis to assess the research trend on psychedelics over a period of 100 years. A scientometric approach objectively maps the scientific knowledge area and shows how research trends have evolved over time which is superior to bibliometric analysis. Total 31,867 documents cumulating 591,329 references from 2809 different sources in 22 different languages were found, with 95.5% being in English. The analysis revealed reveals two essential time periods. The first time period was from early 1900 to 1990 with maximum 171 articles in 1974. The second time period from 1990 to date presents consistently increasing trend of publications, from 190 publications in 1990 to 1538 in 2021. The topmost cited study was the randomised controlled trial of psilocybin use for life-threatening cancer patients with depression by Solmi et al. with depression was published in 2016. The research network analysis found 16,162 institutions, the top three institutions with highest number of publications were University of California (n = 929), the National Institutes of Health USA (n = 770), and the University of London (n = 740). The important trend saw an evolution from LSD effects to the therapeutic potential psilocybin and DMT.[19] Evidence has been accumulating on the efficacy of psychedelics in depression, several phase 2 trials have shown very promising results; both ayahuasca[20] and psilocybin[21] were superior to placebo, and psilocybin was comparable to escitalopram. Other than depression and anxiety new randomized controlled trials are ongoing to evaluate psychedelics in anorexia nervosa.[22] Interestingly, psychedelics seem to reduce the gap between pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, using the effects of the pharmacological intervention as a key to enhance psychotherapy.[23] CONCLUSIONS The use of psychedelics in otherwise treatment refractory conditions is perhaps the most promising development in Psychiatry. Multiple phase II and III clinical trials have proven the efficacy of psychedelics particularly Psilocybin in various mental and physical conditions like depression, addictions, anxiety, anorexia nervosa, and pain. Psychedelics are also a good adjunct to psychotherapy. If used responsibly and with proper caution the psychedelics may revolutionize the field of psychopharmacology. With the approval of esketamine in depression, it may not be too far when psilocybin will also be used in patients with various mental health conditions. The ethical and legal ramifications of the same will also have to be looked into and stringent guidelines will have to laid out.",

However, some patients fail to develop significant tolerance despite careful adjustment, and a few particularly sensitive patients develop severe nausea or vomiting even with the initial doses of levodopa. Since these side effects appear to reflect a central action at the medullary vomiting center similar to that of apomorphine hydrochloride and epinephrine<sup>1,2</sup>a specific antiemetic drug that does not adversely affect the parkinsonian state nor antagonize the therapeutic action of levodopa would be useful.

We report a 10-month-old boy with psychomotor regression and infantile spasms. He was diagnosed with classic phenylketonuria and West syndrome. Treatment was initiated with phenylalanine-restricted diet and vigabatrin. After 5 months of treatment, he persists with developmental delay, severe hypotonia, swallowing disorder, and drug-resistant epilepsy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed the typical abnormalities in supratentorial white matter and exceptional infratentorial and basal ganglia compromise. Severity of white matter abnormalities and neurologic symptoms correlates with blood levels of phenylalanine. Infratentorial changes occur in severe cases. Other mechanisms could take part in cases like this with atypical neuroimaging abnormalities of the basal ganglia.",

      "abstract": "5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-associated neurotoxicity is uncommon; symptoms may occur abruptly or more gradually during the course of chemotherapy. Peripheral neuropathy with 5-FU therapy has only rarely been reported. Two patients treated in a phase I trial of oral 5-FU, leucovorin and eniluracil, an inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), developed delayed onset symptoms of unsteady gait and reduced sensation in the legs. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain and neurologic examination did not support a CNS basis for the condition. Electromyograms and nerve conduction studies revealed sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Other common etiologies of peripheral neuropathy were excluded. The neurological condition of these patients stabilized after 5-FU dose reduction and partial resolution gradually occurred when protocol therapy was stopped. Although CNS symptoms may rarely complicate 5-FU therapy, peripheral neuropathy is unexpected. Patients with DPD deficiency treated with conventional doses of 5-FU typically develop acute CNS toxicity shortly after therapy, accompanied by extremely high systemic exposure to 5-FU. Patients with normal 5-FU clearance may also experience CNS toxicity, particularly with high-dose schedules, and both parent drug and its catabolites may be contributory. Since DPD was profoundly inhibited during eniluracil therapy in these two patients, it is likely that 5-FU or its active metabolites were contributing factors to the peripheral neuropathy.",

Through this updated review, we aim to contribute to the evolving understanding and management of fibromyalgia, offering insights into the diverse tools available to improve the lives of those affected by this challenging condition. Management begins with educating patients to ultimately relieve them of unnecessary testing and provide reassurance. Treatment emphasizes a comprehensive approach, combining nonpharmacological interventions such as aforementioned education, exercise, and psychotherapy, alongside pharmacologic management—namely duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, and amitriptyline—which have consistent benefits for a range of symptoms across the spectrum of fibromyalgia. Notably, drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen are generally not recommended due to limited efficacy and associated risks. Lastly, a variety of other medications have shown promise, including NMDA-receptor antagonists, naltrexone, and cannabinoids; however, they should be used with caution due to a small amount of evidence and potential for adverse effects.",

Several drugs including cocaine, phenytoin, lithium, and amitriptyline are known to cause ocular flutter/opsoclonus rarely. It is poorly described with PCP. This case highlights PCP as a rare cause of toxin-induced saccadic intrusions and attempts to postulate its pathogenesis.

      "title": "ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SILEXAN IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY ANXIETY SYNDROMES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Anxiety and depressive diseases represent leading causes of burden worldwide with a globally increasing prevalence and suffering [1]. Although the heterogeneous clinical presentations do not always fully meet the criteria required for a diagnosis of a full-blown psychiatric disease as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the so-called “subthreshold” or “subsyndromal” severity consistently showed a long-term negative impact on general health, life quality and functionality, and hence a decreased working capability in the affected individuals [2, 3]. For both, subsyndromal as well as full-blown manifestations, beneficial clinical effects on anxious, depressive, psychosomatic and cognitive symptoms and favorable safety profile lacking pharmacological interactions, undesirable sedation, withdrawal symptoms, or abuse potential were repeatedly confirmed for Silexan in patients with primary anxiety syndromes [4, 5]. Additionally, in-vitro studies indicated stimulation of synaptic plasticity, and in rats repeated administration of Silexan decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test [6]. Aims &amp; Objectives Based on the available clinical and preclinical international evidence, the pharmacological profile suggests that Silexan, a proprietary active substance produced from Lavandula angustifolia Miller flowers that has been approved in many countries for the oral treatment of anxiety disorders, may also have an antidepressant effect [6]. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on data from placebo- controlled clinical trials with Silexan at a daily dose of 80 mg [7]. Methods The present meta-analysis investigating comorbid depressive symptoms was conducted based on five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials performed with Silexan in subthreshold anxiety (n = 3) and generalized anxiety disorders (n = 2) [7]. Results The results of the item depressed mood assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale clearly showed that Silexan has a beneficial effect on co-occurring depressive symptoms in these patients [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 315 patients suffering from mixed anxiety and depressive disorder [7]. Silexan was significantly superior to placebo regarding the antidepressant efficacy measured with the Montgomery Å sberg Depression Rating Scale as well as the anxiolytic efficacy measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [7]. Discussion &amp; Conclusion Based on these encouraging results and the need for an antidepressant agent with a beneficial efficacy and tolerability profile lacking unfavorable pharmacological interactions or withdrawal symptoms harming the quality of life, especially in patients with milder forms of depression [4, 7, 8], the antidepressant efficacy of Silexan is currently being investigated in an international randomized placebo-and reference-controlled phase III trial in patients with a mild to moderate major depressive episode (EudraCT Number: 2020-000688-22).

These were strictly unilateral (always on the left side), and were absolutely responsive to indomethacin. They differ clinically from the other two indomethacin‐responsive headaches described up to now: Hemicrania Continua (HC) and Chronic Paroxysmal Hemicrania (CPH). He has a sister suffering from HC. Similar to HC, but unlike CPH, topical tyramine in our patient's eyes resulted in anisocoria before, but not after, indomethacin treatment. Our case differs from HC, however, in its time pattern; it could either be a pre‐chronic stage of HC or a new type of headache. it seems unlikely that a time pattern that has remained unchanged for 17 years will become continuous, as in HC, in the future, and thus it is possible that our patient represents a case of a new type of headache that we propose to name “Hemicrania Episodica.” In any case, it seems probable that this type of headache, although clinically different, may share a common pathogenic basis with HC.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

This may apply to such frequently prescribed drugs as antihistamines, antidepressants and neuroleptic agents, antibiotics, lipid lowering drugs, and many others. Negative chronotropic, inotropic or dromotropic effects, changes in pre- and afterload with a decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output, or the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias have all been reported upon treatment with extracardiac drugs. Physicians mostly fail to consider that these adverse events may well be related to drug effects, but rather ascribe them to the underlying disease or variations in the course of the patient's illness. Recent characteristic examples of the cardiovascular effects of extracardiac drugs are the cardiac arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) caused by the H1-receptor antagonists terfenadine and astemizole. These observations were made only many years after the availability of these drugs on the market-- in some countries even as over-the-counter drugs. In general, both the number of drugs causing undesired cardiac events and the different types of adverse cardiovascular reactions ascribable to these drugs appear to be on the increase.",

      "title": "Use of benzodiazepines in psychiatry.",
      "abstract": "Benzodiazepines are generally well tolerated (compared to barbiturates or antidepressants, their side-effects are milder). They may be used safely, their toxicity is low. Benzodiazepine overdosage may be lethal only if the drug is taken simultaneously with other drugs or alcohol. They act primarily through inhibiting the GABA system, their anxiolytic and sedative effects are of primary importance from the psychiatric aspect. Their classification is based on the difference in their receptor affinity (potency) and kinetics. Derivatives of low, medium and high potency are known. The introduction of high potency benzodiazepines in psychiatry has increased the therapeutic means. The major field of indication of benzodiazepine therapy is DSM-III anxiety disorders and insomnias but they may be successfully used in the treatment of manic conditions, schizophrenia, delirium tremens, clinical conditions accompanied by anxiety-depression, acute restlessness, neuroleptic-induced acute distonias, and akathisias. Even if therapeutic doses are used, tolerance to benzodiazepines may develop after some weeks of therapy. The general withdrawal symptoms are not severe, but the rebound symptoms often hinder the discontinuance of the drug or the reduction of doses. When prescribing benzodiazepines the risk of long-term therapy and the prevention of the development of drug addiction have to be considered.",

      "title": "CHCHD10-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CHCHD10-related disorders are characterized by a spectrum of adult-onset neurologic findings that can include: Mitochondrial myopathy (may also be early-onset): weakness, amyotrophy, exercise intolerance Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): progressive degeneration of upper motor neurons (UMNs) and lower motor neurons (LMNs) Frontotemporal dementia (FTD): slowly progressive behavioral changes, language disturbances, cognitive decline, extrapyramidal signs Late-onset spinal motor neuronopathy (SMAJ): weakness, cramps, and/or fasciculations; areflexia Cerebellar ataxia: gait ataxia, kinetic ataxia (progressive loss of coordination of lower- and upper-limb movements), dysarthria/dysphagia, nystagmus, cerebellar oculomotor disorder Because of the recent discovery of CHCHD10-related disorders and the limited number of affected individuals reported to date, the natural history of these disorders (except for SMAJ caused by the p.Gly66Val pathogenic variant) is largely unknown. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established when a heterozygous CHCHD10 pathogenic variant is detected in an individual with one or more characteristic clinical findings. Management Treatment of manifestations: Adequate nutrition and weight maintenance are essential. Appropriate bracing and stretching can minimize joint contractures, which are often painful and can interfere with caregiving. Those with weakness benefit from assistance with ambulation and posture. Management of ALS, FTD, SMA, and cerebellar ataxia is the same as for other causes of these disorders. Surveillance: Regular evaluations to detect manifestations that can occur with time including neurologic deficits, psychiatric abnormalities, impaired respiratory function, and sensorineural hearing loss. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Baclofen (used to treat spasticity) can sometimes worsen muscle weakness; some drugs used to treat the behavioral manifestations of FTD may worsen dysarthria, dysphagia, and/or respiratory weakness. Genetic counseling CHCHD10-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Many individuals diagnosed with a CHCHD10-related disorder have an affected parent. The proportion of CHCHD10-related disorders caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Each child of an individual with a CHCHD10-related disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the CHCHD10 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible.",

The use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances without medical supervision is associated with significant health risks to the individual who depend on drugs. Therefore, providing of proper treatment services and interventions is important and it must be based on scientific evidence, and match the specific needs of individual patients at a particular phase or severity of their disorder. As a part of that medications can be very helpful in managing and/or treating a variety of drug use disorders and health conditions due to drug use, such as acute intoxication and overdose, withdrawal syndromes, as well as a variety of comorbid disorders. Pharmacological interventions should be administered, when appropriate, alongside psychosocial interventions. Majority of these abusive drugs, medications or their metabolites are excreted through the kidneys. Therefore renal complications including wide range of glomerular, interstitial and vascular diseases leading to acute or chronic renal failure of these drugs are very common. The present review discusses the possible renal complications associated with pharmacotherapy",

Our findings resulted in the following therapeutic recommendations: A monotherapy should be used for as long as possible with slowly increasing doses up to the threshold of tolerance. Only if necessary should alternative drugs or a combination of not more than two drugs be used. Parkinsonism progresses even with the present best therapy. So far, it was only been possible to mitigate this progress, but not to prevent it. In the late stage of the disease it is more appropriate to accept some remaining symptoms than to risk an overdose or polypharmacy with its attendant problems.",

      "abstract": "Because fluoxetine may be associated with an induction or exacerbation of parkinsonism, caution has been suggested when considering fluoxetine as an antidepressant for patients with Parkinson's disease.We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 23 outpatients with Parkinson's disease who were receiving or had received fluoxetine. One author evaluated all patients using the Northwestern University Disability Scale for scoring parkinsonism. Rather than employing a formal depression scale, we assessed depression globally. Concurrent medications were permitted.Twenty of the 23 patients experienced no worsening of parkinsonism while being treated with up to 40 mg of fluoxetine per day. The other 3 patients' parkinsonism worsened to a mild degree: a 74-year-old man experienced an increase in akinesia, tremor, and rigidity; a 77-year-old man experienced a slight worsening in tremor and rigidity; and a 56-year-old man experienced a decline in gait and akinesia. It was unclear if these declines, which were neither acute nor severe, were due to fluoxetine treatment or the progression of the disease. Signs of parkinsonism in 2 patients appeared to improve during fluoxetine treatment.Fluoxetine, in doses up to 40 mg/day, does not appear to be associated with exacerbations of parkinsonian signs and symptoms in outpatients with Parkinson's disease. Further investigation of fluoxetine for the treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease is warranted.",

A 67-year-old female with chronic kidney failure was admitted with febrile sense and lower back pain. The patient was treated with cefepime against pyogenic spondylitis and subsequently suffered from deteriorated mental status. Encephalopathy as a side effect resulting from drug treatment was suspected after other possible causes had been ruled out. The antimicrobial prescription was stopped, and the patient’s mental status recovered. In conclusion, the clinical course of the patient improved after immediate withdrawal of cefepime.

For many AEDs, the mechanisms of action are incompletely understood. More than half of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieve sustained seizure freedom with their first or second drug trials. After a prolonged time of seizure freedom discontinuation of therapy may be considered; the risk of relapse after drug withdrawal can be estimated on the basis of a number of clinical factors.

      "abstract": "Of the community-dwelling elderly population, 25-50% can be expected to suffer pain.The elderly population often receives inadequate pain relief due to (1) ignorance of recommended guidelines for pain control and (2) concern among physicians about prescribing appropriate analgesics for elderly patients, who often have other ailments that directly or indirectly affect pain and its management.Management of chronic pain in older patients differs from that in younger patients because of age-related changes in metabolism and an increased likelihood of multiple medication use.Understanding age-related physiologic changes and other principles of pain management in the elderly patient will allow clinicians to reduce suffering successfully.By considering these factors and by choosing analgesics based on receptor activity, mode of action, and adverseeffect profile, better pain control can be achieved.This article reviews the nociceptive and psychologic factors that contribute to pain.Pharmacologic interventions and pitfalls in pain management for the elderly patient also are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "■ Medications are the most common cause of poisoning morbidity and mortality. Any chemical can become toxic if too much is taken in relation to body weight and physiologic capacity. ■ Substance misuse often leads to acute and chronic toxicity from a variety of medications, commercial products, and illicit agents. The management of acute toxicity from substance misuse typically follows the same general approaches as those for poisoning and overdose. A challenge faced in many acute drug overdoses is determining the agents taken and possible adulterants or contaminants. Chronic misuse can lead to dependence, tolerance, withdrawal, and addiction. ■ Substance use disorder is a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress within a 12-month period. It is a disease that typically starts with drug experimentation and escalates to physiologic, behavioral, and mental changes.",

Fibromyalgia pain does not result from peripheral nociceptor stimulation but instead arises from deficient CNS processing and modulation of pain signals. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and related drugs have some efficacy when compared with placebo in clinical trials. In addition to TCAs and antidepressants, the other commonly seen approach to treating fibromyalgia pain is the use of anticonvulsants. In fibromyalgia patients taking long-term opioids, a methodologically rigorous study shows that administration of the non-ergot dopamine agonist pramipexole significantly reduces pain and improves myriad quality-of-life indices. The benzodiazepines are also associated with mixed results in fibromyalgia trials. Given the lack of inflammatory pathophysiology in fibromyalgia, it is not surprising that no data support use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs in treating fibromyalgia pain.",

      "abstract": "Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)-responsive epilepsies are severe forms of epilepsy that manifest as seizures immediately after birth, sometimes in utero, sometimes months or years after birth. Seizures may be treated efficiently by life-long supplementation with pyridoxine or its biologically active form, pyridoxal phosphate, but even so patients may become intellectually disabled, for which there currently is no effective treatment. The condition may be caused by mutations in several genes (TNSALP, PIGV, PIGL, PIGO, PNPO, PROSC, ALDH7A1, MOCS2, or ALDH4A1). Mutations in ALDH7A1, MOCS2, and ALDH4A1 entail build-up of reactive aldehydes (α-aminoadipic semialdehyde, -glutamic semialdehyde) that may react non-enzymatically with macromolecules of brain cells. Such reactions may alter the function of macromolecules, and they may produce 'advanced glycation end products' (AGEs). AGEs trigger inflammation in the brain. This understanding points to aldehyde-quenching, anti-AGE, or anti-inflammatory therapies as possible strategies to protect cognitive development and prevent intellectual disability in affected children. Studies on how aldehydes traverse cell membranes and how they affect brain function could further the development of therapies for patients with pyridoxine-responsive epilepsies.",

      "abstract": "Objective Certain drugs used in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders can interact with other psychotropic drugs and with pharmacological treatments for physical illnesses. There is a need for an updated comparative review of clinically relevant drug interactions in this area. Design Relevant literature on drug interactions with medications used in the treatment of anxiety disorders was identified through a search in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Results Drug interactions involving medications used to treat anxiety disorders may be pharmacokinetic, such as enzyme inhibition or induction in the cytochrome P450 system and transporter‐mediated drug interactions, or pharmacodynamic, such as additive effects in causing drowsiness or additive effects at neurotransmitter receptors. Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) are particularly liable to be potentially involved in untoward pharmacokinetic interactions. Conclusions The potential for drug interactions with medications used in anxiety disorders should be the cause of clinical concern, particularly in elderly individuals. However, the liability for harmful drug interactions may be anticipated, and the risk reduced. Although not all interactions are clinically relevant, careful monitoring of clinical response and possible interactions is essential. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "title": "Fungal Meningoencephalitis Masquerading as Metabolic Encephalopathy: A Case Report in a 65-Year-Old Geriatric Patient",
      "abstract": "Highlight: A geriatric patient may present with subtle or nonspecific symptoms of meningoencephalitis, such as confusion, altered mental status, or lethargy, rather than classic signs like fever and neck stiffness. Negative CSF cultures of fungal infection should not delay the initiation of antifungal therapy. ABSTRACT Introduction: Infectious pathogens or autoimmune disorders can cause meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, altered mental status, seizure, or neurological deficits. Symptoms frequently manifest atypically in the elderly, which can result in delayed treatment. This case emphasizes how important it is to consider meningoencephalitis in elderly patients with altered consciousness, even without typical signs of it. Case: A 65-year-old female with a history of recurrent hyponatremia and hypokalemia arrived at the emergency room with sudden loss of consciousness, vomiting, and behavioral changes that persisted for a week. The neurological examination and brain CT scan revealed no abnormalities. Severe electrolyte imbalances prompted the initial diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy. Following progressive electrolyte correction, the patient’s mental condition improved. On the second day, she had generalized seizures and developed right-sided hemiparesis. An MRI of the head with contrast showed thicker dura mater and leptomeningeal enhancement in both hemispheres, indicating meningoencephalitis. Ceftriaxone and dexamethasone were administered intravenously, along with levetiracetam, to treat seizures. The next day, cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed Candida spores, but cultures were negative. Intravenous fluconazole was then added to the therapy. Throughout her two-week stay, the patient’s neurological condition improved consistently. Conclusion:Fungal causes should be considered in cases with unclear meningoencephalitis in the elderly, even if fever or meningeal signs are not present. Although CSF culture continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing fungal CNS infection, negative results should not delay the start of antifungal therapy. Early initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy is crucial for successful results in these cases.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Aniracetam is a pyrrolidinone‐type cognition enhancer that has been clinically used in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia following stroke and in Alzheimer's disease. New discoveries in the behavioral pharmacology, biochemistry and pharmacokinetics of aniracetam provided new indications for this drug in the treatment of various CNS disorders or disease states. This article reviews these new findings and describes the effects of aniracetam in various rodent models of mental function impairment or cerebral dysfunction. Also, several metabolites of aniracetam have been reported to affect learning and memory in animals. It is, therefore, conceivable that major metabolites of aniracetam contribute to its pharmacological effects. The animal models, used in pharmacological evaluation of aniracetam included models of hypo attention, hypovigilance‐arousal, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, fear and anxiety, depression, impaired rapid‐eye movement sleep, disturbed temporal regulation, behavioral performance, and bladder hyperactivity. These are models of clinical disorders or symptoms that may include personality disorders, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and sleep disorders. At present, there is no convincing evidence that promising effects of aniracetam in the animal models will guarantee its clinical efficacy. It is conceivable, however, that clinical trials will demonstrate beneficial effects of aniracetam in the above listed disease states. New findings regarding the mechanism of action of aniracetam, its central target sites, and its effects on signal transduction are also discussed in this review article.",

      "abstract": "Within the context of the comprehensive treatment of sleep disorders, which includes medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and social interventions, use of medication is often indicated. Among the three benzodiazepine hypnotics that are available in the United States for the treatment of insomnia, flurazepam is effective for both sleep induction and maintenance, and it retains most of its efficacy over a 4-week period of nightly administration; temazepam is effective only for sleep maintenance, and triazolam improves both sleep induction and maintenance with initial but not with continued administration. Rebound phenomena are more frequent and intense with the more rapidly eliminated drug, triazolam, and to a lesser degree with temazepam. Also, with triazolam, certain behavioral side effects, such as amnesia and psychotic-like symptoms, have been reported. With flurazepam, which is a slowly eliminated benzodiazepine, daytime sedation is more frequent than with the other two drugs. When insomnia is secondary to major depression, antidepressant medication should be administered. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, or other stimulant medications are used for the symptomatic treatment of the sleepiness and sleep attacks of narcolepsy and hypersomnia. For cataplexy and the other two auxiliary symptoms of narcolepsy, imipramine or other tricyclics are the drugs of choice. Protriptyline and medroxyprogesterone have been used in treating mild cases of obstructive sleep apnea, but their efficacy is limited. Similarly, for the treatment of central sleep apnea, medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide have shown only limited effects. Medication for patients with sleepwalking, night terrors, or nightmares should be prescribed judiciously, and primarily when treatment of an underlying psychiatric condition is desired. The neuropharmacology of sleep should also consider drugs that may cause sleep disorders. Medications with sleep disturbing effects include various antihypertensives, bronchodilators, and the energizing antidepressants. Withdrawal of REM-suppressant drugs, such as the barbiturates, may cause nightmares in association with a REM rebound. Occasionally, a drug or a combination of drugs may produce somnambulistic-like activity in some patients.",

Neurological and cardiac symptoms may share underlying physiopathological mechanisms in diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia and Wilson's disease, and in certain metabolic disorders, including Refsum disease, Gaucher disease, a congenital disorder of glycosylation, or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In certain conditions, such as Sydenham's chorea or dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome (ATX-DNAJC19), heart involvement can present early in the course of disease, whereas in others such as Friedreich's ataxia or Refsum disease, cardiac symptoms tend to present in later stages. In another 68 acquired or inherited conditions, cardiac involvement or movement disorders are seldom reported.As cardiac disease is part of the phenotypic spectrum of several movement disorders, heart involvement should be carefully investigated and increased awareness of this association encouraged as it may represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.",

Although diazepam is commonly associated with a variety of side effects, it is generally not believed to cause fugue-like states or retrograde amnesia. This report presents the case of an active duty patient who developed a brief fugue-like state with retrograde amnesia. This was associated with the short-term oral use of diazepam. There was no other apparent cause for his symptoms, which resolved within 24 hours after the diazepam was discontinued. This case suggests that short-term use of diazepam can lead to a brief fugue-like state with retrograde amnesia that has not been reported previously.",

Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

Rhabdomyolysis should be suspected in a patient with vague complaints of muscle pain, and an elevation in creatine kinase is diagnostic in this clinical picture. Patients who have been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis must also be carefully evaluated for compartment syndrome. The mainstay of treatment is aggressive intravenous fluid administration.

These include the diazepam, flunitrazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam, the more potent tri‐ring derivatives alprazolam, midazolam, and triazolam. Some benzodiazepines are also used for posttraumatic stress and obsessive compulsive disorders, alcohol withdrawal, muscle spasm, and seizures. Benzodiazepines are widely abused particularly in drug‐dependent persons using other drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, and opiates. These drugs depress the central nervous system adversely affecting psychomotor and cognitive function and as such cause a range of behavioral changes including disinhibition and increased crash risk of drivers in motorized vehicles. High doses benzodiazepines can cause ataxia, slurred speech, nystagmus, and in susceptible persons paradoxical effects leading to increased aggression.",

      "abstract": "The Landau-Kleffner syndrome consists in the association of an aphasia acquired during childhood or adolescence after a period of normal development, accompanied by epileptic fits and, sometimes, psychological disturbances. The appearance of the symptoms may not be simultaneous. The nature of this syndrome has been widely discussed and even the possibility of being a non-unitary syndrome has been considered. It may be possibly due to diverse etiologies, genetic or acquired (infectious). The relation between the aphasic, the psychologic and the convulsive symptoms has also raised controversies. A case of a female is described in which the psychological symptomatology was so severe, she had to be admitted in a psychiatric unit. The symptoms consisted in agitation during the night and severe persistent insomnia so as difficulties for relationship during day. No abnormalities were detected in a TAC nor in a RM but electroencephalographic and neuropsychological abnormalities were detected. The epileptic fits disappeared with a carbamacepine treatment but the rest of symptoms remained even more accentuated. After her admission, a treatment with valproate achieved to control her fits and the aphasic symptoms and neuropsychological deficits were compensated in the course of several months. After a year of treatment the patient's life was normalized, she resumed her studies, the EEG abnormalities disappeared so as the psychological disturbances and the behavior problems with the exception of phobic symptoms, similar to the ones of other family members. The patient has a history of epilepsy on its mother's side. The evolution and treatment response suggests that at least in some cases of the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, the etiology of the aphasia and other neuropsychological deficits and of the behavior disorders are related with some subclinical epileptic discharges and with a \"functional inhibition\" of some areas of the nervous system.",

When these symptoms are seen in a newborn infant, the physician should consider a diagnosis of withdrawal from maternal drugs. Narcotics reported to cause these symptoms in the neonate are heroin,1 methadone,2 meperidine,3 morphine, codeine,4 pentazocine,5,6 and propoxyphene.7 A glossary of drugs is provided in Fig. 2. The onset of symptoms may be present at birth or may begin within four days of delivery. In some instances, symptoms may not become obvious until 10 days of age. This depends upon the drug the infant was exposed to in utero and the pharmaco-kinetic excretion of the drug. Subacute symptoms of narcotic drug withdrawal may last for 4 to 6 months.8 Rosen and Pippenger9 have demonstrated that infants born to mothers maintained on methadone do not begin to manifest withdrawal symptoms until the plasma level is less than 0.06 µg/mL. In utero exposure to multiple drugs may cause a biphasic pattern of withdrawal symptomatology in the neonate.10 Polydrug abusers frequently use as many as two to five drugs in combination; these might include phenobarbital, diazepam, marijuana, pentazocine, tripelennamine, phencyclidine, and codeine.11 A physician who is unaware of a mother's drug ingestion may initially make an erroneous diagnosis of colic in the infant; therefore, a detailed maternal drug history should be obtained, including prescription and nonprescription drugs received, social habits of the parents, and whether the mother is breast-feeding.",

      "abstract": "The modern era of psychiatric drug treatment began with the introduction of chlorpromazine into the chaotic mental hospital setting in the 1950s as a new psychotropic agent for controlling excitement, agitation, and aggressivity. In that setting the urgency of management problems operated to shrink the complexity of the patient as a psychosocial being down to specific symptoms targeted for chemical subjugation. From this beginning - a chemically produced quieting or tranquillisation - there emerged a revitalised psychiatric movement to expand the strictly medical understanding and treatment of psychological disturbance that acknowledges no limits. This state of affairs has achieved a position of dominance and respect in the mental health industry, based upon social forces operating within psychiatry as a profession and outside of psychiatry in the larger political-economic realm. The catastrophe of widespread and expanding medically-produced disease has failed to alarm psychiatry into taking stock of the determinants of the catastrophe - indeed the existence and magnitude of the tragedy is barely recognised within psychiatry. This conclusion is illustrated by detailed examination of the psychopharmacologic agents alprazolam (Xanax) and fluoxetine (Prozac).",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY The anticonvulsant effect of benzodiazepines is reviewed, both on experimentally produced seizures and on epilepsy in man, including aspects of clinical pharmacology and toxicology. The drugs are chlordiazepoxide (Librium®), diazepam (Valium®), oxazepam (Serax®), nitrazepam (Mogadon®) and clonazepam. Flurazepam (Dal‐mane®) has not been tested extensively. The benzodiazepines suppress generalized EEG discharges but not focal ones. They are highly effective in stopping absence (petit mal), infantile and other myoclonic seizures, akinetic, photosensitive and alcohol withdrawal attacks. They are the drugs of choice to arrest status epilepticus of all kinds and eclamptic convulsions. Grand mal, focal and partial (psychomotor, temporal lobe) seizures are less often controlled and grand mal may be aggravated. Because tolerance may develop, the benzodiazepines are most effective when given parenterally and less effective when given continuously by mouth. Toxicity, usually drowsiness or ataxia, is less apt to be troublesome when the dose is increased gradually. RESUME On a revu ľeffet anticonvulsant des benzodiazepines à la fois sur les crises produites expérimentalement et sur ľépilepsie chez ľhomme, en tenant compte des aspects de pharmacologic clinique et de toxicologic Les drogues étudiées sont le chlordiazepoxide (Librium®), le diazepam (Valium®), ľoxazepam (Serax®), le nitrazepam (Mogadon®) et le clonazepam (Rivotril®). Le flurazepam (Dalmane®) n'a pas été testé de façon étendue. Les benzodiazepines suppriment les décharges EEG généralisées mais non les décharges focales. Elles sont très efficaces pour arrêter les absences (petit mal), les crises infantiles et les autres crises myocloniques, les crises akinétiques et les crises photosensibles et les crises après sevrage alcoolique. Les benzodiazepines sont les drogues de choix pour arrêter les états de mal de toute sorte et les crises eclamptiques. Les crises grand mal, focales et partielles (psychomotrices, temporales) sont moins bien contrôlées et le grand mal peut être aggravé. Parce que la tolérance peut se développer, les benzodiazepines sont plus efficacies quand elles sont données par voie parenterale et moins efficaces quand elles sont donnees de façon continue per os. La toxicité, généralement somnolence ou ataxie est moins fréquente quand le traitement est augmenté progressivement. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Überblick über die antikonvulsive Wirkung der Benzodiazepine auf experimentell erzeugte Krämpfe und auf die Epilepsie beim Menschen; klinisch pharmakologische und toxikologische Aspekte. Folgende Präparate werden berücksichtigt: Chlor‐diazepoxyd (Librium®), Diazepam (Valium®), Oxazepam (Serax®), Nitrazepam (Mogadon®) und Clonazepam. Flurazepam (Dalmane®) wurde nicht ausführlich getestet. Die Benzodiazepine unterdrücken generalisierte EEG Entladungen, nicht aber fokale. Ihre anfallverhütende Wirkung erstreckt sich vorwiegend auf Absencen (Petit Mai), infantile und andere myoklonische Anfälle, akinetische, photosensible Anfälle und solche bei Alkoholentzug. Es handelt sich um Präparate der ersten Wahl zur Behandlung jedes Status Epilepticus und eklamptischer Krämpfe. Die Wirkung auf Grand Mai‐, fokale‐ und Partialanfälle (psychomotorische‐, Temporallappen‐anfalle) ist geringer, ein Grand Mai kann verstärkt werden. Da sich eine Gewöhnung gegenüber den Präparaten entwickeln kann, ist die Wirkung der Benzodiazepine am größten, wenn sie parenteral gegeben werden, geringer bei oraler Applikation über einen längeren Zeitraum. Toxische Nebenwirkungen, gewöhnlich Schläfrigkeit oder Ataxie, sind weniger zu befürchten, wenn die Dosierung allmählich erhöht wird. RESUME El efecto anticonvulsivo de las benzodiacepinas es revisado tanto desde el punto de vista experimental como en la epilepsia del hombre, incluyendo aspectos de farma‐cologia clinica toxicología. Las drogas estudiadas son clorodiacepoxido (Librium®), diacepam (Valium®), oxacepam (Serax®), nitracepam (Mogadon®) y clonacepam. El flurazepam (Dalmane®) no ha sido estudiado. Las benzodiacepinas suprimen las descargas EEG generalizadas, pero no las focales. Son extraordinariamente eficaces en las ausencias (petit mal), en los espas‐mos infantiles y otras crisis mioclonicas, y en las crisis aquinéticas fotosensibles o debidas a la supresión de alcohol. Constituyen el medicamento de electión para detener el status epiléptico y las convulsiones eclám ticas. Las crisis de gran mal, focales y parciales (psicomotoras, lóbulo temporal) son ineficazmente controladas y el gran mal puede incluso verse agravado. Las benzodiacepinas son más activas cuando se administran por via parenteral y menos eficaces “per os” debido a que en estas condiciones su efecto puede ser tran‐sitorio. La somnolencia y la ataxia constituyen los principales efectos secundarios, que pueden evitarse, mediante una administration progresiva.",

Case Summary: A 29-year-old white man and a 29-year-old white woman developed apathy, hypoactivity, blunted affect, depressed mood, and other depressive symptoms while taking olanzapine. Both showed a distinctly abnormal appearance. Clinicians attributed these symptoms to psychiatric illness, but the symptoms disappeared rapidly after drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Discussion: The only previous report of depression from olanzapine involved a medication interaction with fluoxetine. Another report described olanzapine-induced orbital-frontal syndrome, with childlike oversimplicity. If such symptoms are observed, the discontinuation of olanzapine is recommended. Conclusions: These observations suggest additional cautions when olanzapine is used outside of schizophrenia.",

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen. RESUMEN Se aportan seis casos de niños con cefaleas paroxísticas a consecuencia de enfermedades con crisis agudas.

Se discuten los factores diferenciales entre la crisis de cefalea y la migraña. Los ataques de cefalea pueden ser la única manifestación de crisis focales en el sistema límbico y otros puntos del córtex. Algunos de estos pacientes pueden tener otros fenómenos vegetativos tales como palidez y dolor abdominal; casi todos tíenen nauseas y vómitos.",

      "title": "Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson’s Disease: An Updated Overview Focusing on Emerging Pharmaceutical Treatment Approaches",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the commonest and most disabling non-motor manifestations during the course of the disease. The clinical spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment includes subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and PD dementia (PDD). As the disease progresses, cognitive decline creates a significant burden for the family members and/or caregivers of patients with PD, and has a great impact on quality of life. Current pharmacological treatments have demonstrated partial efficacy and failed to halt disease progression, and novel, effective, and safe therapeutic strategies are required. Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence shows that several agents may provide beneficial effects on patients with PD and cognitive impairment, including ceftriaxone, ambroxol, intranasal insulin, nilotinib, atomoxetine, mevidalen, blarcamesine, prasinezumab, SYN120, ENT-01, NYX-458, GRF6021, fosgonimeton, INT-777, Neuropeptide S, silibinin, osmotin, cordycepin, huperzine A, fibroblast growth factor 21, Poloxamer 188, ginsenoside Rb1, thioredoxin-1, tangeretin, istradefylline and Eugenia uniflora. Potential underlying mechanisms include the inhibition of a-synuclein aggregation, the improvement of mitochondrial function, the regulation of synaptic plasticity, an impact on the gut–brain axis, the modulation of neuroinflammation and the upregulation of neurotrophic factors, as well as cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and norepinephrine neurotransmission. In this updated overview, we aim to cover the clinical aspects of the spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment and discuss recent evidence on emerging treatment approaches that are under investigation at a preclinical and clinical level. Finally, we aim to provide additional insights and propose new ideas for investigation that may be feasible and effective for the spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Tardive dyskinesia remains a significant, potentially stigmatizing or crippling adverse effect for any patient treated with an antipsychotic medication. While second- and third-generation antipsychotics have exhibited lower annual incidence rates for tardive dyskinesia than classic or first-generation agents, 3.9% versus 5.5%, the estimated incidence rate is only modestly lower. When coupled with the fact that second- and third-generation antipsychotic medications have come to be employed in treating a wider range of disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, mood disorders, personality disorders, etc.), it is clear that the population of patients exposed to the risk of tardive dyskinesia has expanded. On April 3, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a deuterated version of tetrabenazine (Xenozine®) for the treatment of the involuntary choreic movements associated with Huntington's disease. More recent data, however, have indicated that deuterium tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine (Austedo®) is effective in treating tardive dyskinesia. Moreover, like the other derivative of tetrabenazine, valbenazine (Ingrezza®), deutetrabenazine offers less frequent dosing and a better short-term adverse effect profile than that of tetrabenazine. Longer use in a broader range of patients, however, will be required to identify risks and benefits not found in short-term trials, as well as optimal use parameters for treatment of tardive dyskinesia.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To report a case of serotonin syndrome (SS) resulting from the addition of tramadol to a medication regimen of venlafaxine and mirtazapine. CASE SUMMARY A 47-year-old white man receiving combined mirtazapine and venlafaxine therapy for major depressive disorder developed agitation, confusion, severe shivering, diaphoresis, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, mydriasis, tachycardia, and fever on coadministration of tramadol for chronic pain. An objective causality assessment revealed that the addition of tramadol was the probable cause of the adverse reaction. DISCUSSION SS is a potentially fatal iatrogenic complication of serotonergic polypharmacy. Considered idiopathic in presentation, it typically appears after initiation or dose escalation of the offending agent to a regimen including other serotonergic agents. All drugs that directly or indirectly increase central serotonin neurotransmission at postsynaptic 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors can produce SS. Individual vulnerability appears to play a role in the development of SS. It is likely that the activation of 5-HT 1A receptors by mirtazapine, the combined serotonin reuptake inhibition by venlafaxine and tramadol, as well as possible serotonin release by tramadol, contributed to the development of SS in this case. CONCLUSION It is vital that clinicians are aware of the potential for SS when psychotropic and nonpsychotropic agents are coadministered to certain patients, such as those with both depression and chronic pain.",

Although specific causes such as whiplash injury, prior skull base surgery, rheumatoid arthritis, nerve entrapment by hypertrophied atlantoaxial ligaments, compression of the greater occipital nerve by an anomalous ectatic vertebral artery, and degenerative C1-C2 arthrosis are reported, the majority of cases are idiopathic [8] [11]. A wide variety of treatments have been tried, including cervical collars, transcutaneous nerve stimulation [15], analgesics and antimigraine drugs [9] [18], occipital nerve block with or without glucocorticoid injection, chemical or radio-frequency occipital nerve ablation [19], atlantoaxial arthrodesis, and dorsal cervical rhizotomy [16], all with variable degrees of success.

Not surprisingly, because of the illegality of these substances, many of these individuals die while in the custody of law enforcement. In fact, forensic pathologists have often divided these drug-related custody deaths into four different categories: (a) death during arrest and transport or soon thereafter; (b) death within 12 hours of arrest: (c) death after 12 hours, but within a few days to weeks; and (d) death after days to weeks of incarceration (2). Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

      "title": "Paroxysmal Dyskinesia with Secondary Generalization of Tonic–clonic Seizures in Pseudohypoparathyroidism",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal dyskinesias (PDs) and some motor manifestations of epileptic seizures have been difficult to differentiate clinically. Whether the two disorders are clinically distinct or share common pathophysiologic mechanisms remains undetermined. The classification of PD has been revised according to its precipitating factors as kinesigenic, nonkinesigenic, exertional, or hypnogenic (1). Most sporadic and all familial cases of PD are idiopathic. Symptomatic PD accounts for only a minority of sporadic cases, such as multiple sclerosis, hypoxic encephalopathy, and hypoparathyroidism (2). We report a case of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHT) with kinesigenic PD and secondary generalization of tonic–clonic seizures. A 25-year-old male soldier was admitted to our hospital after losing consciousness twice within a month. In one episode, he remembered running and accelerating down a slope but could not recall what happened later. According to the witness's statement, he was running very fast, then suddenly fell down with trismus and generalized tonic–clonic movements for 3 min. A postictal confusional state was noted. A similar episode occurred when he was doing strenuous horizontal bar exercises. After several successive up-and-down exercises, he lost consciousness and was found with generalized tonic–clonic movements. Records show he had a history of paroxysmal movement disorder since junior high school. The movement disorder always occurred in 100-m running tests. At 70–80 m, he had to decelerate and stop when he felt his arms tightly flex and twist. The duration of each episode was ∼1 min. Episodes never occurred at rest or during moderately paced activities. No history of other neurologic disease was known. A general physical examination noted a short stature (158 cm), alopecia, round face, and a stocky figure. The general examination was otherwise unremarkable. A neurologic examination showed mild cognitive impairment (20 for Mini-mental Status Exam). Trousseau and Chvostek signs were positive. Laboratory examinations revealed a normal chemistry profile with the exception of a calcium total of 4.9 mg/dl; phosphorus, 5.2 mg/dl, and Mg, 1.6 mg/dl. Complete blood count and thyroid function studies were normal. Serum parathyroid hormone level was 164.2 pg/ml. These are consistent with a diagnosis of PHT. Sphenoid electroencephalography (EEG) was normal, except for some focal slow waves (5–6 Hz) over the bilateral frontotemporal regions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed marked, symmetric calcifications on the bilateral putamen and dentate nucleus. No family history of similar paroxysmal dyskinesia was found. During admission, we set up a portable EEG and video recording for the patient and stressed that he run as fast as possible. At 70 m, he felt marked tightness in his arms, and his fists clenched tightly and twisted. He experienced no pain and stopped immediately. The choreoathetoid movement gradually resolved after 1 min. The EEG recording showed paroxysmal generalized sharp-and-slow waves at 4–5 Hz, especially in the frontal areas during the attack (Fig. 1). EEG showing generalized 4–5 Hz sharp-and-slow wave activities with emphasis on bilateral frontal leads induced by running (calibration 1 s, 70 μV). The patient was treated with supplemental calcium and vitamin D with near normalization of his serum calcium in 2–3 months. The paroxysmal movement disorder gradually resolved after calcium replacement and elevation of the serum calcium levels. Cognitive performance improved (25 for Mini-mental Status Exam). By the third month, no further events of PD were reported. The EEG was normal. Hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia and basal ganglion calcification has been described as a secondary cause of kinesigenic PD (3). Hypocalcemia in the absence of renal disease, in association with elevated parathyroid hormone levels, as well as Albright osteodystrophy, are diagnostic of PHT, as in this case. Rare case reports concern PHT and kinesigenic PD. The PD manifested by this patient is precipitated by very strenuous exercise. The choreoathetoid movement and the absence of pain suggest dyskinesia, rather than carpopedal spasm. The following loss of consciousness, trismus, and generalized tonic–clonic convulsion would be most consistent with an epileptic seizure. To our knowledge, it is the first case report of PD leading to secondary generalization of a tonic–clonic seizure. It has been argued that PD may represent one expression of epileptic seizures (1, 2). Our case showed episodes of kinesigenic PD with secondary generalization of tonic–clonic seizures. In the presence of extremely intensive kinesigenic stimuli; that is, a strong sensory (proprioceptive) input to the subcortical thalamic relay and then to the basal ganglia; subcortical-cortical spreading develops (4). Thus in the presence of hypocalcemia, the subcortical-cortical spread may be enhanced owing to increased excitability and lead to the development of secondary generalization of tonic–clonic seizure. However, it is not known in whom with PHT will kinesigenic PD and generalization develop. Recently it was suggested that dopaminergic hypersensitivity in the striatum, known to be a cause of PD, is a secondary phenomenon of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic disinhibition (5). The decrease in extracellular calcium lessens the probability of vesicle release and posttetanic potentiation of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents in central neurons (6). Therefore it may be postulated that GABA may act as an important modulator with hypocalcemia in the pathogenesis of PD and even generalization, because GABAergic dysfunction may alter GABA inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in thalamic relay neurons and may result in rebound bursts of action potential in thalamocortical circuits. We suggest that people with symptomatic PD, such as PHT, avoid rigorous exercise as much as possible. If a kinesigenic PD is followed by a secondary generalization of tonic–clonic seizure, the existence of PHT should be investigated, because this is a potentially treatable disorder.",

The paradigm of learned helplessness represents a model of stressinduced changes in behavior. Using standardized sessions of unpredictable and inescapable footshock, animals have repeatedly been shown to develop a depressive-like behavior including agitation [1], sleep disturbance [2], weight loss, libido reduction, and associativecognitive deficits [3]. Additionally, a lately shown reversion of stress-induced behavioral changes after use of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine proved this model to have a good face, construct, and predictive validity in mice [4].

      "title": "No pain, much gain",
      "abstract": "Most patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) are receiving sedation in order to tolerate the treatment and not to suffer. Sedation is, however, associated with several well-known adverse effects. The need for cardiovascular support increases, weaning from the ventilator is prolonged, ICU delirium may develop, muscle weakness may develop, and the patient's risk for infections increases. In most units, sedation and analgesia are given as a combination of an analgesic, typically an opioid, and a sedative. Other drugs for sedation are also in use such as alfa-2-agonists, ketamine, and isoflurane, but these agents are usually given for specific indications. In Scandinavia a benzodiazepine is most often used for long-term sedation, while propofol is applied for shorter periods. This distinction is not universally applied, in the United States propofol is the most applied agent for sedated patients.1 The most used analgesic is fentanyl.1 However, perhaps the connection of analgesics and sedation as a standard combination represents a conceptional failure. Drugs given for pain control and sedation are often in clinical practice considered as one entity named ‘sedation’, and, indeed, in some centers the practice is to mix analgesics (i.e. morphine) and sedatives (i.e. midazolam) into one drug infusion. A few units sedate only a minority of patients.2 This illustrates that many ICU patients can be treated with no or very low doses of sedatives. The reduced need for sedatives has been facilitated by developments in ventilatory treatment, improving patient ventilator synchrony, more use of noninvasive ventilation, better ICU facilities, use of shorter acting analgesics and sedatives suited during painful or unpleasant procedures, and less use of muscle relaxants. One prerequisite in order to decrease sedation is to treat pain. For pain control, opioids is the current cornerstone among the therapeutic alternatives. Additional potential analgesic efficacy can be achieved by using non-opioid analgesics, neuroaxial blocks with local anesthetics, physical therapy, and optimizing nursing routines. Perhaps a new treatment strategy could be that the physicians approach the patients in a two-step fashion, in which the first step is to relieve pain and the second step is to assess the need for sedation. Doing this, in principle the sedatives would only be given in order to relive anxiety not to camouflage bad pain control. Lower doses of sedatives would thus be needed and sedatives with less respiratory depression, such as alfa-2-agonists, could be more easily applied. The IASP definition of pain is ‘An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.’3 This definition underlining pain as a subjective experience give that pain cannot be measured by a technical device. The gold standard in assessing pain is patient self-report with the numeric rate scale as the most commonly used instrument.4 However, self-report of pain is not usually feasible in the ICU due to the patients' lack of ability to communicate. Still, this is not a setting unique for the ICU. Also for pain in small children and in cognitive impaired patients lack of communication skills hinder self-report of pain intensity. In these patients observer instruments have been developed such as the Doloplus and MOBID used for cognitively impaired persons.5,6 During the development of these instruments, patient behaviors, which are observed during known painful procedures and which are sensitive to analgesics, are included in the scoring systems indicating that the patient is at risk for experiencing pain. Similar instruments are not used in the ICU on a routine basis. The current practice is that nurses and physicians obtain an overall impression about the patients' pain. This impression is subjective, and often physiological observations, such as blood pressure and tachycardia, both parameters that are influenced by a number of other factors, are given too much emphasis. Obviously in order to treat pain adequately, pain intensity must be identified in order to identify patients who need pain treatment and to have the pain treatment response evaluated. Therefore, the effort to develop a pain assessment instrument suited for ICU patients is important. An instrument for measuring pain in the ICU, Critical-Care Pain Observer Tool (CPOT), by observing facial expression, body movement, muscle tension, and compliance with the ventilator was first developed in French and later translated to English by Gelinas and colleagues.7,8 This instrument has been shown to be sensitive to detect suspected increased pain related to painful procedures and reduced pain concomitant with administration of analgesics. However, that an instrument has acceptable properties in one setting and in one language does not guarantee that the instrument measures similar constructs after translation to another language and during use in other contexts. Therefore, it is an imperative that instruments are formally translated and validated before applied. It is therefore highly commendable that Damström et al.9 have performed a formal translation and validation of CPOT to be used in Scandinavian ICUs. It is also important for its implementation into routine use that the instrument is short and that it is scored relatively similar by different observers. The study by Damström et al.9 shows that CPOT has reasonable good psychomimetric properties. However, this does not necessarily mean that the use of this or other pain observations instruments in non-communicating ICU patients will be of clinical benefit. In order to give clinical benefit observations of pain must be coupled with effective pain treatments. Therefore, ICU pain assessment instruments must be tested in clinical studies in order to learn if the use of, for instance, CPOT improves quality of care. Improved pain control can become increasingly viable as a result of usage of pain measurement instruments; both by identifying patients with pain and by enabling researchers to test pain treatment modalities in the ICU. The work by Damström and colleagues, launching a Scandinavian ICU pain intensity assessment tool, can generate a research agenda addressing pain in the ICU. Hopefully, sedation will, in future day-to-day practice, be used generally to treat anxiety and only be used infrequently as a rescue treatment for patients where pain control fails.",

      "abstract": "Hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium below 135 mmol/l, is a potentially life-threatening condition and was shown to be more frequent in elderly and psychiatric patients. In the last years numerous case reports on SSRI- and venlafaxine-induced hyponatremia were published indicating a higher incidence than previously thought. Only few studies have been performed and the incidence reported varies widely from 4.6/1000 people to 25%. It is still unclear if any single SSRI shows a higher incidence of hyponatremia than the others. Some data suggest that venlafaxine may have a stronger association to hyponatremia than SSRIs. Risk factors include age, female sex, low body mass index, severe physical illness, history of former hyponatremia and co-medications known to induce hyponatremia, especially thiazide diuretics. Symptoms of hyponatremia are usually neuropsychiatric (e.g. restlessness, lethargy, cognitive impairment), and any worsening in psychiatric symptoms in patients with a corresponding risk-profile receiving SSRIs or venlafaxine should give cause to check serum electrolytes. Usually SSRI-induced hyponatremia occurs within approximately 30 days and is reported to improve after withdrawal of the drug. Further controlled studies to confirm the true incidence of hyponatremia due to SSRI or venlafaxine and to define predictors more precisely are needed.",

      "title": "A case of incomplete Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome with schizophrenia and global cerebral atrophy",
      "abstract": "Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS), a congenital malformation, is characterized by the triad of capillary malformation, venous varicosities (with or without lymphatic malformation), and limb overgrowth due to soft tissue and bone hyperplasia. Its clinical severity can range from mere cosmetic concerns to severe debilitation consequent to bleeding and deep vein thromboembolic episodes.[1] KTS can also be associated with abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) such as hydrocephalus, cerebral calcification, vascular malformations, cerebral and cerebellar hemihypertrophy.[2,3] Rarely, neurological and/or psychiatric disorders such as mental retardation, seizures, or bipolar affective disorders have been described.[1,4] We herein report a 35-year-old female, product of a nonconsanguineous marriage, referred to the dermatology OPD from the psychiatry ward where she was currently admitted due to complaints of feeling irritable, restless, ineffective, withdrawn, and continually distracted from work since about a year. A day before the current admission, she had physically and violently attacked her brother without any provocation. She also felt that all her family members and acquaintances at work were plotting to harm her. The parents opined her to be oversensitive over trivial matters and worsening over the years to become almost insular. On examination, she was found to be aware of her physical problems and was compliant to commands. Mental status examination revealed formal thought disorder and first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. She was diagnosed as having grade 3 paranoid schizophrenia, i.e., being aware of the illness but attributing it to external factors. History and examination on dermatologist referral revealed the presence of well-defined varicosities on her left arm [Figure 1] around the axilla [Figure 2], cubital fossa [Figure 3], and forearm since birth along with gradually increasing hypertrophy of the 4th and 5th digits [Figure 4] of the left hand since 2-year consistent with a diagnosis of incomplete KTS. Doppler of the axilla revealed grade 3 dilated veins with normal blood flow. Karyotyping, as also biochemical and hematological parameters, were found to be normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain revealed prominent ventricles, sulci, Sylvian-fissure, and basal-cisterns implying mild diffuse cerebral atrophy [Figure 5]. There was no evidence of midline shift, intracranial bleed, or diffusion restriction. Corpus striatum, neuroparenchyma, sellar and parasellar structures along with major intracranial vessels and dural venous sinuses showed normal flow voids.Figure 1: Varicosities seen on the left axilla, cubital fossa, and forearm along with the hypertrophy of 4th and 5th digitsFigure 2: Varicosities - left axillaFigure 3: Varicosities – left cubital fossaFigure 4: Varicosities seen on left forearm along with the hypertrophy of 4th and 5th digitsFigure 5: Axial section of MRI brain in Flair mode at the level of ventricles showing a smaller total brain volume and prominent (a) ventricular system, (b) sylvian fissure and (c) sulci suggestive of mild cerebral atrophyThe patient is currently responding well to aripiprazole along with cognitive therapy. Structural brain abnormalities are well established in schizophrenia, with MRI consistently demonstrating a reduced global cerebral volume along with an increased lateral ventricular volume in its sufferers. Several studies have also reported these abnormalities to progress with time; with greater rates of progression being associated with a worse clinical prognosis. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are inherent to the disease processes underlying schizophrenia or are accelerated upon treatment with antipsychotic agents or other yet-unknown factors.[5] Cerebral hemimegaloencephaly and hemihypertrophy are the most frequent CNS findings reported in up to 18% of patients with KTS.[3] However, global cerebral atrophy-the intracranial abnormality demonstrated in our case has been documented earlier in only two cases of KTS (along with bilateral facial vascular abnormality), though without any evidence of schizophrenia.[5–7] The largest study exploring the psychosocial morbidities associated with KTS till date reported 23.2% of them to have a diagnosed psychiatric disorder (depression in 15% and anxiety in 5%), of which 15% had undergone treatment.[1] The study also reported that the highest prevalence of psychiatric disorder was seen in those above 50 years of age and concluded that KTS patients in pain had a significantly higher chance of developing a psychiatric condition.[1] This increased risk could be due to the diathesis-stress model which suggests that stress exposure on top of a preexisting vulnerability precipitates schizophrenia with increased risk of psychotic episodes.[8] To the best of our knowledge, this forms the first reported concurrence of KTS and paranoid schizophrenia and combined with earlier studies highlights the need to investigate the likelihood of psychiatric conditions in people with KTS. Patients should thus be routinely asked about symptoms of pain, particularly when factors that are more likely to be associated with pain are present.[1] Future larger prospective studies with a longer follow-up are required to define the association between psychiatric disorders and KTS more clearly.

      "abstract": "To the Editor.— Pseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter amphetamine commonly used as a decongestant. Pseudoephedrine is a mixed-acting sympathomimetic amine, causing both the release of neurotransmitters from adrenergic nerve endings and the direct stimulation of adrenergic receptors. While overdoses of other amphetamines can produce a life-threatening adrenergic crisis comprising hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, agitation, and convulsions, serious overdoses with pseudoephedrine alone are rare.1-3 We report the case of a child who suffered a generalized seizure after ingesting pseudoephedrine tablets, a finding not previously reported after isolated pseudoephedrine ingestions.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

This chapter mostly focuses on practical considerations in pharmacotherapy. It also focuses on topics of clinical importance when using conventional antidepressants to treat major depressive disorder: efficacy, overdose potential, treatment-emergent suicidality, therapeutic monitoring and drug–drug interactions, discontinuation syndromes, side effects and adverse events. Major psychological issues that arise in the treatment of depression are also discussed here. Successful treatment of depression is a collaborative effort involving patient, family, clinician (and associates). Faith is needed, and so persuasion and the support of others surrounding the patient can have greater influence on treatment outcome than does the particular choice of pharmaceuticals or psychotherapeutic method.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Due both to the expansion of the psychopharmacological armamentarium and the advances in the medical treatment of severely ill pediatric patients, child and adolescent psychiatrists are increasingly being called upon to manage these patients adjunctively with psychiatric medication. This need has been tempered with concerns over the potential effects of psychotropic medications on the developing central nervous system (CNS) (Jensen, 1998; Vitiello, 1998). The management of these medically ill children and adolescents falls into several categories: A. Pediatric patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders requiring continued treatment for their psychiatric symptomatology (e.g., a schizophrenic patient admitted with an asthma exacerbation) B. Pediatric patients with psychiatric syndromes arising secondary to their medical condition (e.g. a hypoxic patient who becomes agitated secondary to delirium) C. Pediatric patients with psychiatric symptomatology secondary to medications being used to treat medical conditions (e.g., a transplant patient treated with high-dose corticosteroids for organ rejection who develops irritability) D. Pediatric patients who develop psychiatric syndromes following acute medical illness or injury or invasive procedures (e.g., a child who develops posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] following a motor vehicle accident and trauma; a child who develops PTSD following stem cell transplantation) E. Pediatric patients who develop psychiatric syndromes in association with chronic illness (e.g., major depression in a patient with cystic fibrosis) F. Pediatric patients with complex syndromes involving both medical or neurological and somatoform symptoms (e.g., a patient with both seizures and pseudoseizures).",

      "abstract": "Summary Super‐refractory status epilepticus (SE) is a stage of refractory SE characterized by unresponsiveness to initial anesthetic therapy. It is a new concept that has been the focus of recent basic and therapeutic work, and is defined as “SE that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anesthesia, including those cases in which SE recurs on the reduction or withdrawl of anesthesia.” It is encountered typically, but not exclusively, in two quite distinctive clinical situations: (1) in patients with severe acute brain injury, and (2) in patients with no history of epilepsy in whom status epilepticus develops out of the blue with no overt cause. There are a variety of treatments used, almost entirely based on open observational studies or case reports. Therapy includes anesthesia, antiepileptic drug therapy, hypothermia and ICU therapy, other medical, immunological, and physical therapies. In this review, the range of possible therapies is outlined and an approach to therapy is discussed.",

      "title": "The preventive effect of sensorimotor- and vibration exercises on the onset of Oxaliplatin- or vinca-alkaloid induced peripheral neuropathies - STOP",
      "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and clinically relevant side effect of chemotherapy. Approximately 50% of all leukemia, lymphoma, colorectal- and breast cancer patients are affected. CIPN is induced by neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and can manifest with sensory and/or motor deficits. It is associated with significant disability and poor recovery. Common symptoms include pain, altered sensation, reduced or absent reflexes, muscle weakness, reduced balance control and insecure gait. These symptoms not only affect activities of daily living, subsequently reducing patients' quality of life, they have far more become a decisive limiting factor for medical therapy, causing treatment delays, dose reductions, or even discontinuation of therapy, which can affect the outcome and compromise survival. To date, CIPN cannot be prevented and its occurrence presents a diagnostic dilemma since approved and effective treatment options are lacking. Promising results have recently been achieved with exercise. We have revealed that sensorimotor training (SMT) or whole body vibration (WBV) can reduce the symptoms of CIPN and attenuate motor and sensory deficits. We furthermore detected a tendency that it may also have a preventive effect on the onset of CIPN. We are therefore conducting a prospective, multicentre, controlled clinical trial involving 236 oncological patients receiving either oxaliplatin (N = 118) or vinca-alkaloid (N = 118) who are randomized to one of two interventions (SMT or WBV) or a treatment as usual (TAU) group. Primary endpoint is the time to incidence of neurologically confirmed CIPN. Secondary endpoints are pain, maintenance of the functionality of sensory as well as motor nerve fibres as well as the level of physical activity. The baseline assessment is performed prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy. Subsequent follow-up assessments are conducted at 12 weeks, after completion of chemotherapy, and at a 3-month follow-up. Patients who develop CIPN receive an additional assessment at this time point, as it represents the primary endpoint. We hypothesize that SMT and WBV prevent the onset or delay the progression of CIPN, decrease the likelihood of dose reductions or discontinuation of cancer treatment and improve patients' quality of life.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare, but potentially fatal, complex of symptoms associated with antipsychotic use. Acepromazine is a low-potency phenothiazine neuroleptic agent that blocks postsynaptic dopamine receptors and increases the turnover rate of dopamine. Chlorpromazine is a phenothiazine antipsychotic agent with properties similar to acepromazine. Haloperidol is indicated for use in the management of psychotic disorders and to control tics associated with Tourette's disorder.

      "abstract": "Agitation, aggression, and violent behaviour commonly present in acute care settings and may be a factor in up to 2.6% of emergency department (ED) encounters in the US., Agitation is often of unknown or multifactorial etiology; however, it is commonly a result of alcohol or drug intoxication, trauma, or mental health disorders., Patients with agitation can present a risk to staff, other patients, and property. Therefore, for cases in which verbal de-escalation fails, physical restraint and sedation may be required to ensure a safe environment where further acute care diagnosis and treatment can proceed., Treatment goals for this indication are rapid and safe sedation.Droperidol is a butyrophenone used in acute care settings for a variety of purposes, including the rapid sedation of patients with agitation, aggression, or who are exhibiting violent behaviour., Droperidol can be administered intravenously and it can also be administered intramuscularly, which has practical advantages when safely dealing with agitated patients. Many antipsychotic drugs, including droperidol, haloperidol, and olanzapine, have a similar adverse event profile that includes serious events such as respiratory depression, cardiac events, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).In 2001, a black box warning was issued by the US FDA for the use of droperidol based on post-marketing surveillance data., The black box warning emphasized careful patient selection and increased monitoring to prevent corrected QT (QTc) interval elongation in patients administered droperidol. QTc elongation can lead to sudden cardiac death. The extra burden placed on management of patients with droperidol has greatly decreased its use and availability in the US.The purpose of this report was to retrieve and review the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of droperidol for patients with agitation, aggression, or violent behaviour in acute care settings. In addition, this report aimed to retrieve and review relevant evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of droperidol in acute care settings.",

These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fibromyalgia is a pain syndrome which is not due to tissue damage or inflammation and is thus fundamentally different from rheumatic disorders and many other pain conditions. In addition to widespread pain it is associated with a range of other symptoms such as sleep disturbance, fatigue, cognitive disturbance, stiffness and depressive symptoms. A number of multidisciplinary therapeutic programmes involving education, exercise and cognitive therapy have been shown to be effective in bringing relief. The various medications that are currently being developed for the treatment of fibromyalgia are based on different mechanistic approaches. In particular, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) such as duloxetine and milnacipran and α 2‐ δ receptor ligands such as pregabalin have been shown, in a variety of placebo‐controlled studies, to bring significant relief from pain and other symptoms. The complex symptomatology of fibromyalgia will, however, continue to require a multidisciplinary approach including education and exercise in addition to drug therapy to achieve the most efficient management of fibromyalgia.

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

      "title": "Estudio comparativo de la acción psicofarmacológica y analgésica de extractos de plantas de uso terapéutico tradicional con antidepresivos inhibidores selectivos de la recaptación de monoaminas",
      "abstract": "El dolor es una manifestacion clinica frecuente cuyo tratamiento esta lejos de ser optimo, aunque en los ultimos anos se han producidos avances muy significativos. A esto hay que sumar el hecho de que el dolor suele acompanarse de otras enfermedades comorbidas entre las que destacan la depresion, la ansiedad, el deterioro cognitivo y las alteraciones del sueno. Los antidepresivos son farmacos frecuentemente utilizados en el tratamiento del dolor, bien solos o en combinacion con otros analgesicos. Su utilizacion se debe principalmente a dos motivos: por su accion analgesica en algunos cuadros clinicos de dolor neuropatico, y por sus propiedades antidepresivas, logicamente, e incluso ansioliticas en algunos casos. Hasta el momento, no se conoce con exactitud el mecanismo de accion por el cual los antidepresivos producen su efecto analgesico, ni tampoco las diferencias entre ellos en el contexto del dolor. Centrandonos en las investigaciones preclinicas, es necesario de cara a un futuro desarrollo de nuevos farmacos antidepresivos analgesicos, conocer la sensibilidad de los diferentes modelos de dolor a los mecanismos especificos de accion antidepresiva. Los antidepresivos con alguna excepcion suelen ejercer su accion farmacologica inhibiendo la recaptacion de monoaminas, concretamente serotonina y noradrenalina, y este mismo mecanismo parece ser el que les concede actividad analgesica. Asimismo, este mecanismo les hace poseer accion ansiolitica. Es necesario por tanto en psicofarmacologia preclinica, discernir sobre la capacidad de los diferentes antidepresivos para inducir efecto antidepresivo, analgesico y ansiolitico en diferentes metodos que puedan servir para orientar la investigacion futura en este campo. Tambien es necesario conocer su capacidad de producir efectos sobre la cognicion ya que su uso cronico puede derivar en un deterioro cognitivo . Un aspecto de gran importancia y que ha constituido uno de los objetivos de esta tesis es saber el rango de potencia en relacion con la dosificacion de los antidepresivos y su mecanismo de accion como agentes capaces de inducir efecto analgesico y ansiolitico. Es decir, es importante conocer si las dosis a las que se evidencia un efecto analgesico son las mismas a las que se observa un efecto ansiolitico y tambien relacionar este orden de potencia con los efectos cognitivos. Como quiera que el mecanismo de accion de los antidepresivos esta relacionado con la inhibicion de la recaptacion de serotonina y noradrenalina y que los rangos de potencia para inducir este efecto son diferente entre ellos, es de importancia saber que modelos son mas sensibles a un mecanismo u otro. Es decir, es de interes conocer que modelos son mas especificos para detectar un efecto serotoninergico o noradrenergico o los dos, en relacion con el efecto antidepresivo, ansiolitico, analgesico y cognitivo. Tambien es importante, puesto que la mayor parte de los modelos son interferidos por la posible capacidad que tienen los antidepresivos de producir cambios en la motricidad, conocer si los efectos que observamos estan o no relacionados con estos cambios motores, con el fin de no inducirnos a error en futuras investigaciones.",

One patient additionally developed systemic symptoms (including fever, fatigue, and night sweats) and another had a posterior circulation stroke. Symptoms developed with either early or prolonged use of minocycline. Despite withdrawal of minocycline, patients needed long-term immunotherapy to gain neurologic improvement.Our findings suggest that the typical neuropathy associated with minocycline use is painful single or multiple mononeuropathy due to peripheral nerve vasculitis, which may also be accompanied by presumed CNS vasculitis (presenting as stroke).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: A subsequent headache within seven days of a head injury (or after regaining consciousness after the head trauma)is referred to as a post-traumatic headache (PTHA); it is referred to as chronic or chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTHA) if it lasts longer than three months after the injury. Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

The emergence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment of clozapine has been reported in some case studies. We report on the case of a 31-year old man with chronic schizophrenia who had shown obsessive-compulsive symptoms during treatment with clozapine.A 31-year old patient with treatment refractory schizophrenia was treated with clozapine. During clozapine treatment, positive symptomatology decreased, but after 4 months after starting clozapine the patient showed obsessive and compulsive symptoms. This symptomatology had previously not been a feature of this patient's illness.Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were observed during treatment of clozapine in a schizophrenic patient. This may be explained either by the serotonin-receptor antagonism of clozapine or its atypical dopaminergic receptor effects.",

Pharmacologic management of acute agitation relies on typical antipsychotics, particularly haloperidol; benzodiazepines; and atypical antipsychotics. The selection of a specific agent (or combination of agents) should be guided by etiologic considerations, efficacy of the drug(s), side effects, potential drug interactions, and drug formulation. Seclusion or restraints are treatments of last resort due to safety issues.Compared with conventional antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol), preliminary evidence indicates that atypical antipsychotics effectively reduce agitation, are better tolerated, and have fewer side effects. After an acute episode, atypical agents also help ease the transition from intramuscular to oral medication to promote ongoing treatment.",

      "title": "Epilepsy: Treatment Options.",
      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

      "title": "Baclofen neurotoxicity in chronic hemodialysis",
      "abstract": "Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46‐year‐old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5 mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37 °C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4 g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm 3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm 3 . Serum sodium was 134 mmol/l, potassium 6.4 mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3 mmol/l, urea 30 mmol/l, creatinine 998 μmol/l, glucose 5.16 mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4 mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen‐associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was &gt;600 ng/ml (therapeutic range 80–400 ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (&lt;200 ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4‐h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72 h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low‐dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.",

Examples of such drugs are LSD, mescaline, and tryptamine derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The imagery-producing psychodysleptics such as cannabis and various coumarins (e.g., from Calea zacatechichi) potentiate visual imagery and produce characteristic distortions in time perception, body-image, and thought. Trance-producing psychodysleptics (such as lysergic acid amide (obtained from Rivea corymbosa) ololiquhqui, turbicoryn, and corymbosine), as their names suggest, produce trance-like states.

      "abstract": "General anesthesia is characterized by unconsciousness, analgesia, muscle relaxation, and depression of reflexes, generally in response to the administration of chemical agents that induce reversible unconsciousness. Study of the cognitive neuroscientific basis of general anesthesia involves evaluation of the effect of anesthetic agents on consciousness and the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive function. Central nervous system dysfunction after anesthesia and/or surgery can occur at any age but is a particular issue for elderly patients. Studies of delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction have been published in many countries since the end of the last century. We present a discussion of delirium disorders and a review of the literature.We also present case reports for 2 patients who underwent general surgery for epilepsy. The first patient experienced postoperative visual illusions, hallucination, and time and space disorientation. The second patient experienced a postoperative zombie-like delirium state. The status of both patients was improved in response to treatment with methylprednisolone. The first patient also received amantadine sulfate, and the second patient received antiepileptic drugs.The brain is the main target organ for anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and age-associated changes in the brain have important implications with respect to general anesthesia. Anesthetists and surgeons have suspected for many years that some patients suffer a postoperative decline in cognitive function. The condition generally has a good outcome because oxidative nerve cell derangements and neurotransmitter imbalances are transient.",

      "abstract": "Behaviour disorders resulting from localized lesions of the brain have attracted increasing attention recently. With the rapid progress being made in neurosurgical treatment there is a prospect that their accurate diagnosis may become more than an academic exercise. In the present paper a description will be presented of characteristic overactive behaviour which appears, in the majority of cases, to be due to cortical damage, frequently involving the temporal lobe, and sustained either at the time of birth or in later childhood. The behaviour symptoms exhibited were remarkably constant throughout the series of twenty-five children studied. There was marked restlessness, distractibility and an inability to concentrate for more than a few seconds at a time. The affected children showed an apparent compulsive need to touch every object which they saw, and to suck or chew them. Outbursts of aggressive and irresponsible behaviour occurred frequently, and the patients seemed to be incapable of responding to reprimand or chastisement for longer than a few minutes. The majority suffered from epilepsy or showed other evidence suggesting the presence of cerebral damage on examination.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "The presence of cataplexy in people with narcolepsy has a well-documented tight association with very low or non-detectable levels of the central nervous system neuropeptide, hypocretin (also termed orexin) while levels of hypocretin are normal in people with narcolepsy without cataplexy. There is evidence to suggest that hypocretin may have an association with pain, migraines and headaches in people with narcolepsy. However, these studies have not compared findings across narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Currently, there are no studies published to determine whether pain, migraines and headaches are just common symptoms experienced by all people with narcolepsy or whether the presence of the cataplexy symptom (and thus assumed low levels of hypocretin) exacerbates these symptoms. Also, it is unclear whether general health and wellbeing (including psychological wellbeing) is similarly affected by hypocretin levels, or may be confounded by different levels of other health symptoms, such as pain. This review poses a number of research questions that need to be explored about whether the presence or absence of cataplexy is differentially associated with different types, severity and location of chronic pain; frequency, location and types of migraines and headaches; and general health and wellbeing among people with narcolepsy. A greater understanding of the role of hypocretin in these health complaints could aid in the development of more appropriate treatments for pain, migraines and headaches amongst people with and without narcolepsy.",

There are several mania/hypomania cases that have been associated with atypical antipsychotic treatment that also display antimanic, antidepressive and anxiolytic effects in addition to their antipsychotic effects. In this study, a case of schizophrenia in which manic symptoms developed after increasing the dosage of quetiapine to 300 mg/day, and subsequently disappeared after cessation of treatment is presented. Although the blockage of 5HT2 receptors and the disinhibition of frontal dopamine secretion seemed to be the reasons for the development of the mania/hypomania related to atypical antipsychotics, the mechanism is not clear. During the use of atypical antipsychotics, clinicians should be cautious to patients' mood fluctuations.",

We report on a case of primary diagnosis of ADHD in adulthood with secondary cocaine dependency, who was neuropsychologically assessed before and following treatment with methylphenidate. Frequency of errors and reaction time in performance on attention tests, concentration tasks, and multiple stimuli-/reaction tasks improved under treatment with methylphenidate. ADHD may be treated efficiently even after primary diagnosis in adulthood.

For acute pain, analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates are commonly used, sometimes combined with regional anesthesia, such as peripheral nerve block or peridural local anesthesia. The mechanism of transition from an acute to a chronic pain state is poorly understood. Only NMDA receptor antagonists and epidural morphine have shown relatively consistent results as preemptive analgesics. Agents more successfully used to manage chronic pain include those that modify the neurochemistry of the spinal cord dorsal horn, such as tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, γ-amino butyric acid agonists, local anesthetic analogs, and NMDA antagonists. Opiates may be used chronically, but tolerance and lack of efficacy may then develop. In selected patients with refractory chronic pain, centrally administered analgesics may be considered, including opiates, dilute local anesthetic, NMDA receptor antagonists, clonidine, midazolam, baclofen, or calcium channel blockers. For both acute and chronic pain, a single agent may be less effective than combinations of analgesics with different mechanisms of action.",

Two or more attacks could occur in a single night and were most common in the early morning hours. Family and personal histories did not show epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, or (with 1 exception) previous somnambulism. Electrographic investigation revealed that all patients had normal waking‐sleep cycles but that 4 of them had epileptiform abnormalities on their electroencephalograms. All patients were treated with either phenytoin or carbamazepine, with cessation of the abnormal nocturnal behavior during follow‐up periods ranging from 9 to 48 months. This syndrome appears to be distinct from more typical non–rapid eye movement dyssomnias and suggests an atypical form of epilepsy.",

Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

      "abstract": "Clarithromycin-induced psychosis is a rare phenomenon; however, over the previous two decades, there has been increasing evidence linking psychotic episodes to the use of clarithromycin. The exact aetiology of this remains unclear, but several key hypotheses have arisen, including gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA-A) antagonism and active clarithromycin metabolites altering brain neurotransmitters such as glutamate. Recent evidence describes a broad range of symptoms, including delusions and catatonic states. Prior psychiatric comorbidities are a substantial risk factor. This case report describes the development of clarithromycin-induced psychosis in an 86-year-old patient with no prior psychiatric medical history, cognitive or functional impairment, and no other pathology found accountable for this neuropsychiatric disturbance. By acknowledging this rare adverse effect of clarithromycin and discontinuing the drug, the patient's psychotic symptoms resolved within 24 hours. Given the widespread use of clarithromycin, this case report demonstrates the importance of being aware of its rare neuropsychiatric adverse effects to diagnose this relatively unusual presentation.",

      "abstract": "Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a common disorder often seen in elderly patients affected with neurodegenerative disorders and peripheral neuropathies. Defective baroreflex-mediated sympathetic activation in response to standing results in neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Lightheadedness, dizziness, blurring of vision, palpitations, and/or recurrent syncope in response to sudden postural change or prolonged standing are the characteristic symptoms presented by patients with orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic symptoms may be further aggravated by certain medications, fluid depletion, food intake, increased temperature, or physical deconditioning. Bedside orthostatic test, head-up tilt table test, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are the important tests to diagnose orthostatic hypotension. Discontinuation of medications that cause or exacerbate orthostatic hypotension and non-pharmacological approaches should be initially tried to treat neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. If the patient does not have significant improvement, add-on pharmacotherapy should be administered. Midodrine, droxidopa, and fludrocortisone are the commonly administered medications for treating neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Systematic reviews have shown that there is moderate level of evidence that droxidopa and midodrine improve orthostatic hypotension in the short term. Fludrocortisone is included in the treatment guidelines based on expert opinion, despite having low level of evidence. However, there is no much evidence for the long-term efficacy of any pharmacological agent used to treat orthostatic hypotension. Treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension should be periodically assessed. Predominantly, it involves measuring symptomatic benefit including impact on activities of daily living as well as blood pressure monitoring.",

      "title": "Classification and Definition of Disorders Causing Hypertonia in Childhood",
      "abstract": "Objective. This report describes the consensus outcome of an interdisciplinary workshop that was held at the National Institutes of Health in April 2001. The purpose of the workshop and this article are to define the terms “spasticity,” “dystonia,” and “rigidity” as they are used to describe clinical features of hypertonia in children. The definitions presented here are designed to allow differentiation of clinical features even when more than 1 is present simultaneously. Methods. A consensus agreement was obtained on the best current definitions and their application in clinical situations. Results. “Spasticity” is defined as hypertonia in which 1 or both of the following signs are present: 1) resistance to externally imposed movement increases with increasing speed of stretch and varies with the direction of joint movement, and/or 2) resistance to externally imposed movement rises rapidly above a threshold speed or joint angle. “Dystonia” is defined as a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. “Rigidity” is defined as hypertonia in which all of the following are true: 1) the resistance to externally imposed joint movement is present at very low speeds of movement, does not depend on imposed speed, and does not exhibit a speed or angle threshold; 2) simultaneous co-contraction of agonists and antagonists may occur, and this is reflected in an immediate resistance to a reversal of the direction of movement about a joint; 3) the limb does not tend to return toward a particular fixed posture or extreme joint angle; and 4) voluntary activity in distant muscle groups does not lead to involuntary movements about the rigid joints, although rigidity may worsen. Conclusion. We have provided a set of definitions for the purpose of identifying different components of childhood hypertonia. We encourage the development of clinical rating scales that are based on these definitions, and we encourage research to relate the degree of hypertonia to the degree of functional ability, change over time, and societal participation in children with motor disorders.",

      "title": "Clozapine therapy for Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders",
      "abstract": "Recent research on the role of clozapine in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders is discussed. Most clinical trials have shown resolution of or improvement in psychotic symptoms accompanying Parkinson’s disease without worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. Adverse effects appear to be mild at dosages of < 100 mg/day; sedation is the most frequent problem. Most of these studies have serious limitations, however; until better studies have been completed, the decision to use clozapine for Parkinson’s disease-related psychosis should be made on a case-by-case basis, with thorough evaluation of risks, benefits, and other therapeutic options. Some patients with Parkinson’s disease have shown improvement in tremor and other abnormal movements when given clozapine. Clozapine cannot be recommended for treating tardive dyskinesia on the basis of the research done so far; some trials show dramatic resolution of symptoms, others no benefit. Anticholinergics or dopamine-reuptake inhibitors should be considered before clozapine is given to patients with tardive dyskinesia because of clozapine’s potential for serious adverse effects. A few patients with Huntington’s disease have responded to clozapine, but again no conclusions can be drawn. Clozapine appears to offer no real advantage over haloperidol for treating choreiform movements in Huntington’s disease. The frequency of tics in Tourette’s syndrome does not seem to be reduced by clozapine. Clozapine has shown some efficacy as a treatment for psychosis and abnormal movements in Parkinson’s disease. Results have been less promising for other movement disorders. Further study in larger populations is needed before any definitive conclusions about clozapine’s place in movement disorder therapy can be made.",

      "abstract": "Drug allergies represent nowadays the big imitators of diseases. One of the still puzzling diseases with irritates doctors and patients alike is the severe drug (induced) hypersensitivity syndrome (D[i]HS), often also called drug rash (or reaction) with eosinolphilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). It appears after 2 ― 12 weeks of treatment, affects liver (hepatitis), but also other organs like the heart (carditis), lung (pneumonitis), colon (colitis) and kidney (nephritis). Most cases have an exanthema, a rather typical swelling of the face, fever and a massive eosinophilia. Eliciting drugs are antiepileptics, certain sulfanil-amides like sulfasalazin and sulfamethoxozalole, minocyclin, allopurinol and antiretroviral agents. Depending on the eliciting drug, some organs are more frequently affected than others. The diagnosis of a drug hypersensitivity reaction underlying the severe disease is often delayed and doubted, in particular as many symptoms may continue for weeks and reappear later with other, non related drugs. Recurrences of symptoms may also be precipitated around the third week by reactivation of herpes viruses (HHV-6, CMV). Since the lethality is in the range of 10%, an early diagnosis and use of corticosteroid in cases with severe organ involvement is necessary.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the regional administration of opioids is to provide an efficient and prolonged analgesia. Then, opiates can be useful for postoperative analgesia and for the treatment of chronic pain of malignant origin. Analgesia is correlated with several adverse effects of which the most frequent are nausea and itching and the most severe is respiratory depression. Beside the adverse effects, other properties of opiates could be responsible of favourable effects which can be taken in advantage in specific indications. In the postoperative period, epidurally administered opioid can attenuate the neuroendocrine and metabolic responses to surgery and pain. This effect is responsible of a reduction of the resistance to insulin and of a better nutritional balance, especially after major abdominal surgical procedures. Opioids also act by a reduction of the motor functions of the bowel, which perhaps could reduce the incidence of anastomotic breakdowns. Finally, other effects have been reported, as anecdotes, such as the treatment of spasm after bilateral replantation of the ureters, neurologic bladder dysfunctions and enuresis. Spinal administration of opioids has also been used as a treatment of premature ejaculation.",

      "title": "ANTYPSYCHOTICS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT – LITERATURE REVIEW",
      "abstract": "Aim. To analyze the administration of antipsychotics as main pharmaceuticals in treatment of schizophrenia as chronic mental disease involving several positive, negative, cognitive, and affective symptoms resulting in disorganization of mental activity and mental disadaptation in patients. Results. We have found the data on the absence of significant differences in efficacy of antipsychotics relative to positive symptoms and mental disorganization symptoms except for advantages of clozapine in the treatment of resistant cases. It shown that the therapy efficacy from the position of treatment of negative, depressive, and cognitive symptoms is determined depending on: (1) how the reduction of positive symptoms (delirium and hallucinations) improves the secondary symptoms of disease, and (2) how side extrapyramidal effects (EPSE) and side anticholinergic effects are corrected by drugs administered to influence EPSE aggravating the mentioned symptoms. There is a reasonable opinion that strong antipsychotics that do not have accompanying extrapyramidal actions and do not require the combined anticholinergic therapy have huge therapeutic advantages. Conclusion. It is found that having much in common in efficacy all antipsychotics greatly differ in rate and intensity of side effects. Contrary to belief that second-generation antipsychotics (so called atypical antipsychotics) are normally considered the drugs with less risk of extrapyramidal actions and higher risk of metabolic side effects in comparison with traditional antipsychotics; the significant variability of frequency of these and other side effects of these two types of drugs indicates that such categorical distinguishing of pharmaceuticals is not clinically justified. The choice of antipsychotic should be based on individual preferences of patients, their therapeutic response to the previous treatment, history of presence and specifics of antipsychotic side effects, medical data on risk factors, level of compliance to the prescribed treatment, and, especially, the profile of side effects of various antipsychotics.",

Its main symptoms are tremor at rest muscle stiffness and bradykinesia, i.e. slowness of movement (the so-called parkinsonian triad). Atrophic lessons of substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, responsible for the production of dopamine, contribute to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Patients with Parkinson’s diseases suffer from a variety of extra-motor symptoms often psychiatric disorders, especially panic or generalized anxiety. The author presents the case of 63 years old man diagnosed with Parkinson’s diseases 4 years ago, with quite a significant severity in the last 2 years. Left limb weakness (upper and lower) deepened and general slowing of movement developed then restless legs syndrome developed fully (specific sensations in the area of the feet and lower legs in the evening and night hours, temporarily decreasing when moving, walking, stretching the muscles). For about 6 months he have had attacks of anxiety and anxiety as well as a fully developed generalized anxiety disorder. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa and pregabalin was used, resulting in a reduction of slowness and stiffness as well as a significant reduction in anxiety and anxiety after approximately 8 weeks.",

      "abstract": "Many areas of neurodivergence are associated with heightened sensitivity, discomfort, and aversion to certain visual stimuli (e.g., bright lights, patterns, movement, flicker, complex scenes). This hypersensitivity also associates with mental health and some areas of neurology. However, it remains unclear whether this is a transdiagnostic phenomenon, implying a common underlying mechanism of shared vulnerability, or whether the forms of visual discomfort differ instructively across the wide range of associated conditions and areas of neurodivergence. We compared the four recently clarified subtypes of visual hypersensitivity (Brightness, Pattern, Strobing, Intense Visual Environments) self-reported by 2582 participants across 11 areas of neurodivergence, neurology, and mental health: Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Fibromyalgia, Migraine, PPPD, synaesthesia, Distress, Eating Pathology, and Fear (HiTOP System). Enhanced sensitivity in all four factors was reported for every area. Sensitivity to Intense Visual Environments was especially pronounced across Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, and Dyspraxia, forming a shared pattern. The same pattern was shared with fibromyalgia and PPPD, and to some extent with Eating Pathology and Fear, while migraine and synaesthesia showed a different pattern. Regression analyses controlling for comorbidities showed significant unique prediction by 9 out of 11 neurodivergence/condition labels, the strongest predictors being autism, fibromyalgia, migraine, and PPPD. In conclusion, the four factors of visual hypersensitivity are all transdiagnostic, and the relative emphasis on each factor also forms transdiagnostic patterns that transcend traditional discipline boundaries. This implies there are common underlying vulnerabilities in the development of perceptual systems that can be associated with a wide range of other symptomologies.",

This attack is not accompanied by loss of consciousness, and a fully realized person. Most episodes are caused by the specific manifestations of emotions — laughter, joy, anger. Purpose of the study. Cataplexy is often considered as part of a fairly rare disease — narcolepsy type 1, which is also characteristic of sleep at night, severe daytime sleepiness, and may hypnagogic hallucinations hypnopompic. Despite the fairly objective criteria for the disease, there are a number of states, is also accompanied by paroxysmal changes in muscle tone, which makes it necessary to conduct a thorough differential diagnosis. Material and methods. The clinical observation of the patient, who appealed for urgent indications of the guide with a diagnosis of «state after an epileptic seizure». Results and discussion. This describes the clinical observation of the patient with sudden bouts of loss of tone in the lower extremities, neck, provoked by fear, laughter, and a long time is observed at the neurologist diagnosed with epilepsy and receive anticonvulsant therapy. Conclusion. After several studies, including specific neurophysiological data paroxysms were regarded as katapleksicheskie patient with narcolepsy.",

Over 100,000 American veterans of Desert Storm/Shield (approximately 15% of deployed U. S. Armed Forces) returned from the Persian Gulf and slowly (6-24 months or more) presented with a variety of complex signs and symptoms characterized by disabling fatigue, intermittent fevers, night sweats, arthralgia, myalgia, impairments in short-term memory, headaches, skin rashes, intermittent diarrhea, abdominal bloating, chronic bronchitis, photophobia, confusion, transient visual scotomata, irritability and depression and other signs and symptoms that until recently have defied appropriate diagnoses (1-3). These symptoms are not localized to any one organ, and the signs and symptoms and routine laboratory test results are not consistent with a single, specific disease (1). The signs and symptoms of GWI have been reported by 27/28 of the Coalition Armed Forces that were deployed against Iraqi units in Kuwait and Southern Iraq. The only exception is France. This brief review will summarize some of the possible exposures that occurred, the types of illnesses that resulted from these exposures, and some of the treatments that have been used on GWI patients.

Treatment resistance, non-adherence, and severe adverse effects such as diabetes mellitus type II, extrapyramidal side effects, etc. are among the unmet needs commonly faced by clinicians, probably due to the fact that the pathophysiology of both schizopherenia and depression have not been fully elucidated. Today, neither the monoamine hypothesis of depression nor the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia explains either disorder in full. In spite of its widespread presence throughout the brain, the glutamatergic system has remained almost unexplored with respect to drug discovery for psychiatric illnesses.Recently, the promising outcomes of intravenous use of ketamine to overcome resistance to antidepressant treatment and the administration of a nitroprusside infusion to address resistance to antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia have drawn attention to the glutamatergic system.",

      "title": "Clinical studies in patients with persistent pain: towards optimisation of pharmacological treatment",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain can be nociceptive, inflammatory, neuropathic or a combination of these types ofpain. Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) are two of the mostcommon types of neuropathic pain. A number of drugs including tricyclic antidepressants,gabapentin, pregabalin, oxycodone, and topical lidocaine are available for the treatment ofneuropathic pain. However, when each is used as monotherapy, these drugs provide pain relief in40-60% of patients, leaving the rest with unremitting pain.Within the past fifteen years, there has been increasing evidence that cytokines produced by nonneuronalcells in the central nervous system (CNS) such as activated glia, may play a key role inthe establishment and/or maintenance of chronic pain. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as theinterleukins, IL-1H and IL-6, appear to exacerbate pain while anti-inflammatory cytokines such asIL-10 appear to ameliorate pain. In the past five years, the potential role of cytokines incompromising the analgesic effects of opioids, has been recognized. Hence, it has been proposedthat receptors and ion channels on activated glial cells in the CNS may provide novel targets forthe development of new therapeutic agents for the relief of chronic pain in humans. In addition,an improved understanding of their ability to modulate opioid analgesia has the potential toimprove the clinical utility of opioid analgesics in the management of chronic pain.My doctoral research program was undertaken in an attempt to generate new knowledge that mayhave the potential to improve outcomes in the management of chronic pain in patients. Part Oneof my research evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed low daily dose of oxycodone at10 mg/day in combination with pregabalin (75-600 mg/day) in 62 patients with PHN or PDN.The results from this six week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group studydemonstrated that irrespective of whether patients received a combination ofpregabalin/oxycodone or pregabalin/placebo, they reported a significant improvement in theirlevels of pain at the end of the study. This study further supports the effectiveness of pregabalinin the treatment of PHN/PDN, but does not support the notion that the addition of a low doseoxycodone 10 mg/day enhances the pregabalin effect.Part Two of my research program was a preliminary investigation of the plasma andcerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of cytokines in patients with chronic non-cancer painwho had received intrathecal (i.t.) opioid therapy of morphine or hydromorphone administeredalone or in combination with local anaesthetics. The aim of Part A of this cytokine study was toexamine whether or not there was a significant correlation between the plasma and CSFconcentrations of each of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, and the anti-inflammatorycytokine, IL-10, in paired samples of these fluids collected from 50 patients who were alreadyreceiving i.t. opioids for chronic pain management. The paired blood and CSF samples collectedduring a pump refill. The results showed that there was no significant correlation between pairedplasma and CSF concentrations of either IL-6 or IL-10 (p > 0.05), consistent with the notion thatcytokines produced by peripheral immune cells do not readily cross the blood-brain-barrier andthat cytokines in the CNS are produced by activated glia.Part B of this latter study was designed to evaluate a possible temporal effect of chronic use of i.t.opioids on the concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, and the anti-inflammatorycytokine, IL-10, in paired plasma and CSF samples collected from 10 patients, who werescheduled to start using i.t. opioids and who were assessed over a three month period. The plasmaand CSF samples were taken just prior to i.t. pump implantation, at 4 to 7 days after i.t. pumpimplantation and initiation of a chronic i.t. opioid infusion, and at three months after initiation ofthe chronic i.t. opioid infusion. These preliminary results demonstrated that chronic i.t. opioidadministration appears to upregulate CSF concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6,which in turn may contribute to the attenuation of opioid analgesia and subsequently to thedevelopment of tolerance and hyperalgesia after chronic use of opioids. Future studies beyond thescope of the present investigation are required to further investigate this notion.The outcomes from Part One and Two of my doctoral research program provide a significantcontribution to the knowledge base for the management of chronic pain. The randomizedcontrolled trial suggests a potential for lower doses of pregabalin 75 and 150 mg/day incombination with a low fixed daily dose of oxycodone at 10 mg/day to be used for the treatmentof neuropathic pain. This subsequently would be more cost effective and would reduce thehealthcare utilization of pregabalin in the treatment of neuropathic pain, but larger clinical trialsconducted over a longer timeframe are required to further evaluate this proposition. The resultsfrom Part Two of this study show that evidence from animal studies implicating a role forcytokines in the establishment and maintenance of persistent pain as well as modulating theeffects of opioids appear to translate to humans with persistent pain, but additional research isrequired. Together my doctoral research findings provide important information in the quest toimprove the clinical management of chronic pain and to improve the clinical utility of analgesicsdrugs.",

      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is often \"spontaneous\" or \"stimulus-independent.\" Such pain may result from spontaneous discharge in primary afferent nociceptors in injured peripheral nerves. However, whether axotomized primary afferent nociceptors give rise to pain is unclear. The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) mediates the negative affective component of inflammatory pain. Whether the rACC integrates the aversive component of chronic spontaneous pain arising from nerve injury is not known. Here, we used the principle of negative reinforcement to show that axotomy produces an aversive state reflecting spontaneous pain driven from injured nerves. Additionally, we investigated whether the rACC contributes to the aversiveness of nerve injury-induced spontaneous pain. Partial or complete hind paw denervation was produced by sciatic or sciatic/saphenous axotomy, respectively. Conditioned place preference resulting from presumed pain relief was observed following spinal clonidine in animals with sciatic axotomy but not in sham-operated controls. Similarly, lidocaine administration into the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) produced place preference selectively in animals with sciatic/saphenous axotomy. In rats with spinal nerve ligation (SNL) injury, lesion of the rACC blocked the reward elicited by RVM lidocaine but did not alter acute stimulus-evoked hypersensitivity. Lesion of the rACC did not block cocaine-induced reward, indicating that rACC blockade did not impair memory encoding or retrieval but did impair spontaneous aversiveness. These data indicate that spontaneous pain arising from injured nerve fibers produces a tonic aversive state that is mediated by the rACC. Identification of the circuits mediating aversiveness of chronic pain should facilitate the development of improved therapies.",

Duloxetine is one of three medications currently FDA approved for use in FMS management. Duloxetine is a mixed serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that functions by increasing central nervous system levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. This review is a primer on use of duloxetine in FMS management and includes information on pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, a review of the three duloxetine FMS treatment trials currently in publication, a discussion of the safety and tolerability of duloxetine, and patient-focused perspectives on duloxetine use in FMS management. Duloxetine has proven efficacy in managing pain and mood symptoms in adult FMS patients with and without major depressive disorder. However, due to side effects, duloxetine must be used with caution in patients with fatigue, insomnia, gastrointestinal complaints, headache, cardiovascular disease, bleeding-risk, and in those 24 years of age and younger due to risk of suicidality. Duloxetine use should be avoided in patients with liver disease or alcoholics. As with all medications, duloxetine is best used as part of an individualized regimen that includes nonpharmacologic modalities of exercise, education and behavioral therapies.",

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has also been found in patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and parkinsonism, after abrupt discontinuation of usage of L-dopa and drugs that are dopamine receptor agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine, pergolide, ropinirole, pramipexole, and amantadine). Symptoms that may suggest the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are low muscle tone, fluctuations in blood pressure, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased or very high body temperature, sweating, confusion, dysarthria, or urinary retention, psychomotor agitation, tremors, drooling, or shortness of breath.",

      "title": "Amitriptyline for fibromyalgia: Off‐label treatment, but non‐inferior to approved medication",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic and widespread musculoskeletal pain disorder. The prevalence of FM is 2.7% worldwide, especially in women and in patients over the age of 50.1 The main symptoms of FM are chronic pain, fatigue, depression, and insomnia. FM is also associated with a variety of diseases.2-4 Patients commonly experience chronic and widespread pain. The clinical presentation may have a negative impact on the quality of life. The prognosis for FM is generally poor. Most patients experience only partial relief of symptoms and there is a risk of recurrence and chronic pain. In severe cases, the patient may even become too disabled to carry out daily tasks. The management of FM is currently divided between pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies. Patients often use a variety of strategies to manage their pain and comorbidities.5, 6 There are three drugs currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of FM, which are pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used off-label for the treatment of FM;7 some studies even suggest that low doses of amitriptyline are the first choice for the treatment of FM.8 However, off-label policy use makes the definition of true efficacy and acceptability unclear. The lack of comparisons with other drugs may overestimate the clinical efficacy of amitriptyline. Recently, Farag et al9 published a network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of amitriptyline compared with other FDA-approved therapeutic agents. A total of 36 randomized clinical trials (11 930 patients) were included. NMA enables comparisons that cannot be made in clinical studies or traditional meta-analyses. This NMA confirms the results associated with the treatment of FM with pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran. It was also found that the use of amitriptyline was associated with improvements in sleep disturbances (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.97; 95% CI, −1.10 to −0.83) and quality of life (SMD −0.80; 95% CI, −0.94 to −0.65), fatigue (SMD, −0.64; 95% CI, −0.75 to −0.53), and small improvements in pain (SMD, −0.27; 95% CI, −0.21 to −0.32) compared with placebo. The NMA shows that amitriptyline is no less effective than other drugs in the treatment of symptoms of FM. The results of the study are presented in Table 1. Fibromyalgia brings a large economic burden to the healthcare system and society, with drugs being the main source of total costs.10, 11 In the previous cost-effectiveness analysis, amitriptyline, pregabalin, and duloxetine are considered cost-effective medications for FM. Most notably, amitriptyline is the drug of preference and the most cost-effective.12 In conclusion, the proven efficacy and acceptability of amitriptyline in fibromyalgia is an encouragement to both medical professionals and patients. Clinicians can choose the appropriate medication through shared decision-making with fibromyalgia patients based on disease severity, co-morbidities, and tolerability.

The first is the hitherto unknown disease discovered by an unexpected adverse reaction to anesthetics or/and muscle relaxants up to a life-threatening incident. A second problem is the probable, suspected or proven disposition to malignant hyperthermia in patients with other neuromuscular diseases. Furthermore, severe rhabdomyolysis can be induced in myopathic muscle by the application of succinylcholine alone or in combination with inhalational anesthetics resulting in hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria and CK-elevation, sometimes followed by cardiac arrest. Cardiomyopathy is a common feature in many neuromuscular diseases. All cardiodepressant agents must be avoided. Specific problems with muscle relaxants arise in myasthenia gravis and in the myotonias. In the later stages of severe neuromuscular diseases the main problem concerning anesthesia is respiratory failure. The individual risk of every patient has to be evaluated before anesthesia. Recommendations for the anesthetic management are given.",

The disease is apparently inherited as a dominant trait; x-linkage cannot be excluded. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria; (1) attacks of stiffness precipitated by surprise or minor physical contact; difficulty in sudden movements but absence of signs of myotonia or myokymia; (2) presence of the electromyographic counterpart of the stiffness, continuous activity at rest with normal action potentials; (3) disappearance of the continuous electrical activity after diazepam. The symptoms were most marked in infancy, but ameliorated with time, becoming milder than in the average acquired case. The cause of this familial syndrome is presumably different from that or those of acquired, sporadic cases of stiff-man syndrome.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to differentiate whether neuropsychiatric symptoms are caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or psychiatric background, coexisting disorders or drug-induced side effects. The aim of this paper is to present two cases of psychotic symptoms (bipolar and paranoid disorder) induced by chloroquine. Case 1: Severe depressive episode with psychotic features appeared in the context of third SLE exacerbation and chloroquine treatment. Hydroxychloroquine was used instead and symptoms resolved. Later, manic episode (with psychotic features) emerged several days after chloroquine was prescribed for concomitant arthritis. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Case 2: The second patient started to suffer from headaches and being lightheaded three days after chloroquine administration and within next few days feeling of derealization and poorly defining persecutory delusions accompanied by strong anxiety with occasional visual illusions occurred with clear consciousness. After eighteen days chloroquine was withdrawn and after two days all the symptoms resolved. Clinicians should be vigilant for possible psychiatric disorder when using chloroquine in patients with SLE. Such cases are probably rare and may include both paranoid and bipolar spectrum disorders. Studies on interactions of chloroquine with brain neurotransmitter systems are needed. Hydroxychloroquine may represent lower risk considering psychiatric complications. Mechanism of the difference is currently not known.",

      "title": "Psychedelic Therapy: A Primer for Primary Care Clinicians – Part I. Historical Perspective and Overview",
      "abstract": "Background: Psychedelic drugs have recently emerged as plausibly effective pharmacological agents for the management of depression, anxiety, and other neuropsychiatric conditions, including conditions that have not benefited from prior interventions. The latter half of the twentieth century marked a revolution in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and psychosis, exemplified by the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, dopamine antagonists, and other pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, mental illness remains a major public health crisis, affecting nearly one billion individuals worldwide. Areas of Uncertainty: Due to the recency of the resurgence in psychedelic research, there are still only a small number of large, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of psychedelics in psychiatric populations. While initial clinical trials of psychedelics for depression were very promising, trials of psilocybin with larger sample sizes (100+ participants) seem to suggest that it may not be more effective than antidepressants.Therapeutic Advances: Esketamine, a dissociative hallucinogen drug, was approved for the management of major depressive disorder by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019. As of December 2023, two Phase III trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a synthetic drug that inhibits the serotonin transporter, have been completed; the results indicate that MDMA is superior to existing pharmacological treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder. A phase III trial of psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonin receptor partial agonist, is currently underway. The following series details the current state of research in psychedelic therapeutics, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N-N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and ayahuasca, psilocybin, ibogaine, MDMA, and ketamine. Conclusions: Psychedelic drugs and structural derivatives offer a great deal of promise for the management of a wide range of psychiatric morbidities. It is imperative that clinicians become familiar with these novel agents and learn how to implement psychedelic therapeutics as part of a patient-centered care paradigm.",

It is difficult to calculate the number of drug addicts or the number of occasional drug users. It is important take into account that some patients are using more than one drug. The acute use of cannabis induces important changes in cognition and psychomotor performance. No signs of neurotoxicity were found in chronic marihuana users. Some \"designer drugs\" can induce neurotoxicity. MDMA, that have hallucinogenic activity, is a neurotoxin in animals. MPTP kill dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, inducing Parkinson's disease. Volatile substances containing toluene or n-hexane are usually abused by young people.

      "title": "The Potential Role of Iatrogenic Comorbidity in the Interaction between Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy in Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the setting of anxiety disorders is often viewed as a potential source of augmentation of clinical effects, with little attention paid to the potential occurrence of negative events. In most of the studies, however, if benefits ensued, they were modest and likely to fade. Further, 4 high-quality and well-designed individual studies suggest that the addition of a benzodiazepine or an antidepressant to cognitive behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders could be detrimental compared to placebo at follow-up. The aim of this review was to outline a novel hypothesis, which needs to be adequately tested but may shed some new light on this interaction. Any type of psychotropic drug treatment, particularly after long-term use, may increase the risk of experiencing additional psychopathological problems that do not necessarily subside with discontinuation of the drug or of modifying responsiveness to subsequent treatments. The changes are persistent and not limited to a short phase, such as in the case of withdrawal reactions, and cannot be subsumed under the generic rubrics of adverse events or side effects. The term ‘iatrogenic comorbidity' refers to unfavorable modifications in the course, characteristics, and responsiveness of an illness that may be related to treatments that were administered previously. The likelihood of iatrogenic comorbidity needs to be considered in clinical practice: The concurrent use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may yield advantages in the short term, but its costs at some later point in time may largely outweigh such benefits.",

ADHD is a risk factor for academic difficulties, school dropout, social isolation, injury, oppositional behaviour. In school-age children and adolescents having moderate to high or persistent impairment despite psycho-educational support and environmental modification, the first-line treatment is methylphenidate. Group or individual cognitive behavioural therapy for parents and/or children and adolescents is recommended for co-occurring disorders and persistent impairment. In France, the initiation of methylphenidate requires an annual hospital prescription by a paediatrician or psychiatrist, and a regular medical supervision (weight, heart rate, blood pressure…). At least once a year, the indication of methyphenidate needs to be re-evaluated and confirmed at the hospital. In case of lack of efficiency and/or poor tolerance, therapeutic alternatives including non-psychostimulants should be considered.Quelle prescription des psychostimulants chez l’enfant ?

      "abstract": "Sir: Rhabdomyolysis, a syndrome characterized by muscle necrosis, can be fatal, and it needs immediate attention.It can be classified as either traumatic or nontraumatic. 1 Nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis is associated with many etiologies, including hypothyroidism. 2 In both traumatic and nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis, intracellular muscle contents are released into systemic circulation.There are a few reported cases of hypothyroidism disclosed by rhabdomyolysis. [2]3][4][5][6] We hereby report a rare case of a patient who presented with new-onset gait abnormalities, limb weakness, rhabdomyolysis, and agitation, which were precipitated by noncompliance with levothyroxine and were secondary to hypothyroidism.The noncompliance was secondary to the patient's paranoia.Since the patient carried the diagnosis of schizophrenia, his agitation was automatically and incorrectly attributed to his mental illness.Case report.Mr. A, a 65-year-old white man, was admitted to the psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) for psychomotor agitation and combative behavior in April 2007.He had a past medical history significant for hypothyroidism secondary to thyroidectomy and radical neck dissection for carcinoma.It was reported that, a few weeks before admission, Mr. A had been threatening his caregivers, shaking his fist, and raising his voice.In addition, 2 days prior to admission, he woke up unable to walk but able to crawl to a phone and seek help.Mr. A's agitation was presumed to be a result of his mental illness.Due to his past psychiatric history of untreated schizophrenia, he was directly admitted to the PICU from the emergency room.The results of a complete blood count, basic metabolic profile, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, coagulation profile, magnesium and phosphate levels, liver function tests, urine drug screen, and routine urine analysis were normal.Mr. A's creatinine kinase (CK) level was elevated at 394 IU/L (normal range, 30-170 IU/L), with a CK-myocardial band isoenzyme fraction of 7.7, and his myoglobin level was elevated at 153 ng/mL.His troponin levels were normal.Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T 4 ) levels were 60.4 mU/L and 2.9 mU/L, respectively.A head computed tomography scan revealed no definitive acute intracranial abnormality but was suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic gliosis.A neurology consultation was sought for new-onset gait abnormalities and limb weakness.Mr. A refused to follow through with the consultant's recommendations of further neuroimaging, including a magnetic resonance imaging scan.His lower extremity weakness and gait instability were attributed to his profound hypothyroidism.The plan was to initiate levothyroxine along with physical therapy, but the patient did not agree to it.Mr. A's CK level continued to elevate during his stay and peaked at 4969 IU/L on the fifth day after admission.Due to these high levels, he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit.Mr. A continued to be uncooperative with all of the interventions, including intravenous hydration.He was eventually transferred back to PICU on the same day.Mr. A continued to refuse psychotropic agents but accepted levothyroxine after much persuasion.In addition, he was treated with aggressive oral fluid resuscitation.With treatment, Mr. A's free T 4 and triiodothyronine levels normalized, and TSH levels were in a downward trend.Quite interestingly, his CK levels also normalized, and there was resolution of both his physical and psychiatric symptoms.This outcome provides evidence that hypothyroidism may account for rhabdomyolysis accompanied by psychiatric symptoms.Mr. A did not receive any neuroleptics for his aggression in view of elevated CK levels, and he refused to take valproic acid and lorazepam, which were recommended to address his impulsivity, irritability, and aggression.Hypothyroidism may cause rhabdomyolysis and present with psychiatric symptoms, which may go unnoticed. [2]][4][5][6] Mentally ill patients can have significant comorbid medical illnesses that may have a cause-effect relationship with the mental illnesses, as well.The agitation should not be automatically attributed to underlying psychiatric condition, and the necessary medical workup should not be withheld, as illustrated by this case report.",

      "abstract": "Amphetamines are central nervous system (CNS) stimulants and belong to psychoactive drugs that affect chemicals in the brain, nerves and exert a constant contribution to hyperactivity and impulse control. The communal group of amphetamines comprises amphetamine, dextroamphetamine and methamphetamine. Amphetamines show its action on the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system by inducing release of dopamine and to some extent norepinephrine, in the synaptic clefts of the nucleus accumbens and other terminal areas. They offer not only a sense of euphoric state, but also addiction. Amphetamines are frequently prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents and adults, narcolepsy and obesity. At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, improved cognitive control, etc. The balance of benefit/risk is the main challenge for its clinical use. When overused these medications can be highly addictive, are often diverted from the user to be used as recreational drugs. Adverse effects include anxiety, aggression, headache, insomnia, hyperactivity, palpitations, increased breathing rate, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, arrhythmia, dilated pupils, paranoia, etc. However, at large doses, these drugs may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Even higher doses may give rise to hallucinations, paranoia, psychosis and potentially lifethreatening conditions such as convulsions, stroke, kidney failure, etc. The furthermost serious health implications of amphetamine resulting from chronic use are dependence, considered by compulsive drug-seeking and drug use and a phenomenon notorious as amphetamine psychosis. Therefore the objective of this study was to explore the functions of the amphetamines as recreation drug of abuse.",

      "abstract": "Frank Lagattuta: I Have No Relevant Financial Relationships To Disclose To determine how many patients on tramadol developed serotonin syndrome with or without other medications. Retrospective cohort. Pain management clinic. 4,415 patients at multiple sites who were prescribed tramadol (alone or with other medications) in the last 12 months. Not applicable. Serotonin syndrome (a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by a change in mental status, neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic hyperactivity) and other abnormal side effects, including nausea and vomiting. There were 3,798 patients on tramadol alone; 58 patients on tramadol and venlafaxine; 195 patients on tramadol and duloxetine; and 364 patients on tramadol and nortriptyline. None of these patients suffered from serotonin syndrome. 5% developed nausea, vomiting, or an uneasy feeling and stopped taking the medication. Although tramadol has previously been linked to serotonin syndrome, this study shows that is a rare occurrence, and, if monitored appropriately, tramadol can be used alone or with other antidepressants in chronic pain patients with depression. Mental health providers use combination antidepressants in many cases with minimal serotonin syndrome as well. Other studies have shown that tramadol has a very low abuse potential and may be a better choice of analgesic for long term treatment for mild to moderate chronic pain. Level III",

Abuse of certain noncontrolled prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications also may occur. To some degree, any medication that exerts psychoactive effects may be abused if taken in high enough doses or by means that result in high serum or cerebrospinal fluid levels. Many clinicians may be unaware of the potential for abuse of these medications. This review examines evidence of the possibility of abuse of several common medications that theoretically do not have abuse potential, including cough and cold preparations, antihistamines, anticholinergics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, skeletal muscle relaxants, and antiemetics. Means by which such medications may be abused and biochemical and physiological mechanisms fostering their abuse also are discussed.",

The development of neuropsychological deficits depends on the type of seizures. Particularly BNS-seizures and the Lennox-Gastaut-syndrome have generally a poor prognosis concerning the intellectual development. Not only clinically manifest seizures but also subclinical discharges could disturb the psychic condition of epileptic patients.

Cette pathologie survient le plus souvent au decours d'un traumatisme ou d'une intervention chirurgicale. On estime sa prevalence a environ 1/2 000 traumatismes. Le traitement de cette affection est mal codifie et les formes graves responsables de douleurs invalidantes ou de dystonies sont le plus souvent rebelles aux traitements usuels. Deux nouvelles approches therapeutiques de ces formes graves sont proposees par Kemler et al. et par van Hilten et al. \\rLes premiers ont compare sur une periode de 6 mois 54 patients ayant une symptomatologie douloureuse tres invalidante rebelle aux traitements depuis plus de 6 mois, traites par reeducation conventionnelle seule ou associee a une stimulation electrique medullaire. La stimulation medullaire reduit considerablement l'intensite de la douleur et ameliore la qualite de vie de 11 % des patients sans pour autant apporter d'amelioration fonctionnelle nette. Ce type de traitement semble donc etre indique dans les formes tres algiques d'algodystrophie.\\rVan Hilten et al. ont traite 7 femmes atteintes de formes dystoniques multifocales ou generalisees, par un agoniste des recepteurs GABA de type b, le baclofene, en injection intrathecale. En bolus, ce traitement induit chez 6 patientes sur 7 une regression partielle ou complete des dystonies des mains mais n'a que peu d'effet sur les atteintes des membres inferieurs. Administre de facon continue, le baclofene permet de recuperer une fonction normale des mains chez 3 patientes, dont 2 ont aussi retrouve un usage des membres inferieurs permettant la marche. Le baclofene semble aussi agir sur la symptomatologie douloureuse et les retractions des membres inferieurs. Cette etude confirme ce qui etait suspecte : l'implication de circuit neuronaux GABAergiques dans la survenue de ces formes dystoniques d'algodystrophie. L'utilisation de baclofene intrathecal en perfusion continue a deja demontre son innocuite a le long terme dans le traitement des spasticites. Ce traitement semble donc une nouvelle option therapeutique des formes graves dystoniques d'algodystrophies.1. Kemler M.A. 2000.

Behavioral findings include symptoms such as drowsiness, ataxia, fatigue, confusion, weakness, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, reversible dementia, depression, impairment of intellectual, psychomotor and sexual function, agitation, auditory and visual hallucinations, paranoid ideation, panic, delirium, depersonalization, sleepwalking, aggressivity, orthostatic hypotension, and insomnia. Neuroendocrine findings include: central depletion of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine, adrenaline (AD), and serotonin (5-HT); reduction in the ratio of circulating NA/AD as well as platelet 5-HT and increase of AD, plasma free 5-HT and cortisol. These disturbances together with the increased platelet aggregability observed in the three groups are typical of unresolved-stress situations. Immunological findings include significant reduction of peripheral T lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) and the CD4/CD8 ratio, CD 16 and gamma-delta cells. On the other hand, the three groups (elderly subjects, subjects faced with unresolved stress, and BZ consumers) show increase of the CD57 lymphocyte subset as well as natural killer cytotoxicity. Alterations of several biological markers have also been found, specifically in the oral glucose tolerance test, the intramuscular clonidine test, and the supine/orthostasis/exercise test. From a clinical point of view, the three groups appear to be more susceptible to the appearance and progression of many acute and chronic diseases (infectious and malignant diseases). As a result, chronic consumption of BZs should be avoided in both the elderly and subjects in unresolved-stress situations.",

      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease Idiopathic Parkinson`s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction frequently being associated with frontostriatal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.The prevalence of PD increases with age and is estimated at 100-200/100000 people (Chen et al., 2001;Schrag et al., 2000) worldwide.The clinical hallmarks of PD are akinesia, rigidity and tremor (Douglas et al., 1999;Hughes et al., 1992).In the past PD has been considered as a pure movement disorder, but in recent years the presence of non-motor symptoms in PD has been recognized.Non-motor symptoms include a variety of autonomic dysfunctions such as orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia, bladder dysfunction, sleep disturbances, psychiatric symptoms, i.e. depression, hallucinations or psychosis and cognitive impairment.Non-motor symptoms such as pain, depression or sleep disturbances might precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and are sometimes even more disabling than motor deficits.For many years cognitive impairment and the occurrence of dementia have been considered as not typical for IPD.James Parkinson (Parkinson, 1817) wrote in his essay on the shaking palsy \" the senses are not disturbed\".However, there is now enough evidence in the literature that dementia might occur in up to 40% of PD-patients (Emre et al., 2004).PD dementia is the third most common reason for dementia.Dementia in PD has been associated with reduced quality of life, greater sensitivity to medication, higher risk of developing psychosis, shortened survival (Levy, 2002), increased caregivers stress and frequent transfer to nursing homes (Aarsland et al., 2000) compared to PD-patients without dementia.In contrast to dementia mild cognitive impairment might occur early in the course of the disease.Approximately, a quarter of PDpatients without dementia have mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 20% might have MCI at the time of diagnosis (Aarsland et al., 2011).The cognitive deficits in PD are specific and include executive dysfunction, attentional and visuospatial deficits.Executive functions include control, manipulation, and cognitive flexibility (",

      "title": "Some Psychosomatic Aspects of Food Allergy",
      "abstract": "Summary Some patients experience untoward idiosyncratic reactions when they eat certain wholesome foods. Such illness may be caused by psychogenic or allergenic mechanisms, or by both. The relative importance of psychogenic and allergenic factors in the production and continuance of food-induced illness must be estimated correctly in order to plan a correct program of therapy. This paper reports some of my experiences with the treatment of about 600 patients (seen in the past ten years) who had certain food-induced syndromes, with or without associated primary neuropsychiatric disturbances. Foods become endowed with various dynamic emotional meanings according to the person's upbringing, cultural and religious training, and personal life experiences. Psychogenic food reactions may include anger, anxiety, anorexia, depression, euphoria, feelings of security, guilt, hostility, passive-dependent attitudes, pleasure, syncope, and relaxation. The most common untoward idiosyncratic psychosomatic reactions to food include nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort or pain, intestinal cramps, aerophagia, belching, and rarely diarrhea--all being part of the riddance reaction. The symbolic supportive values of certain foods are such that a person may overeat these foods when he is subjected to unusual emotional stresses. Such categories of foods include the \"security,\" \"reward,\" and \"pleasurable association\", foods. An individual may eat excessive amounts of these foods during times of emotional stress, even though they may be the very ones which produce his allergic illness. The fixed food allergy is very well known, but relatively uncommon. The variable food allergy is very common, but not very well known. In the variable food allergy, tolerance for a given food may vary so that at some times small amounts of the offending food will cause an allergic reaction. But at other times the amount of this food which must be ingested to cause an allergic reaction may be very much greater than any amount that the patient would ordinarily eat. Allergic reactions following the ingestion of offending foods have certain characteristics: there is a latent period between ingestion of the food and the appearance of signs and symptoms; the allergic syndrome has a certain pattern of development and regression of signs and symptoms; it has intensity and duration. These properties in part determine the nature of allergic reactions to repeated ingestion of subthreshold and threshold doses of offending foods. With brief postcibal allergic reactions, each ingestion of a threshold dose of offending food is followed by a discrete reaction. Usually there is no summation of subclinical effects produced by ingestion of repeated subthreshold doses. Repeated daily ingestion of threshold doses of foods which give prolonged postcibal allergic reactions will cause a clinical pattern of allergic reaction resulting from summation, fusion, and adaptation to each individual allergic insult, until finally many patients may develop a steady state of allergic reaction. The daily ingestion of subthreshold doses of such foods is capable of causing a clinically obvious allergic reaction through virtual summation of clinically inapparent allergic reactions caused by ingestion of each subthreshold dose. Each primary allergic reaction set off by ingestion of an unknown allergenic food actuates a secondary postnoxious pattern of behavior which becomes an important part of the patient's reaction to the offending food. But if a patient knows he is eating an allergenic food which will make him sick in a specific way, he does not develop the secondary postnoxious behavior pattern. Recurrent episodes of spontaneous food-induced allergic illness occurring at unpredictable intervals cause certain patterns of conditioned responses in humans. Not knowing when he will be well or sick acts as a frustrating cue, in response to which a patient develops the human counterpart of the non-problem-solving behavior described by Maier for frustrated rats. These secondary reaction patterns of behavior often become so prominent and extensive a part of the patient's complaints to the doctor that even an astute allergist at first glance may consider mistakenly that the patient's problems are purely psychiatric. But further careful clinical study of such a patient will show that he is experiencing a primary allergic reaction to an offending food, which in turn sets off a chain of behavior patterns which are the patient's unconscious response to his allergic illness. Sometimes the secondary behavior patterns engendered by intermittent allergic episodes may become so incapacitating to the patient that they constitute his chief health problem. The food-induced allergic mental, fatigue, and pain syndromes are described. These may occur singly or in any combination, and may be associated with any other allergic syndromes. The patient's response to combined allergic and psychological therapy is illustrated by three case reports. As a result of psychotherapy alone, a patient may unconsciously modify his diet so that he includes less of the security, reward, and pleasurable association foods. If he is also allergic to these foods, he will have a remission in his illness as an indirect consequence of psychotherapy. Many patients are relieved of allergic ill health when they abstain from known offending foods. However, some of these patients will have conscious or unconscious needs at certain times to eat allergenic foods which they know will make them sick. The subtle nature of food-induced self-injury readily escapes the attention of the patient's family and friends--and even, sometimes, of his unsuspecting physician. Self-inflicted, food-induced allergic illness can become a recurrent problem until the physician can understand the basic psychodynamics of such self-injurious behavior, and can then help the patient to make better adjustments to life problems. The best management of all patients with food allergies requires both expert allergic therapy and expert psychotherapy.",

More recently, deep brain stimulation/motor cortex stimulation has anecdotally been utilized for certain intractable pain states. Although brain electrical stimulation has not been adequately trialed or in some cases even tried at all for management of a variety of symptoms, it is conceivable that in the future it may be a potential therapeutic option in efforts to palliate various severe refractory symptoms (eg, intractable pain, nausea, dyspnea, delirium).",

      "abstract": "Structural damage of the human brain (perinatal damage, cerebral trauma, head injury, cerebrovascular and degenerative diseases, intracranial tumor, metabolic diseases, toxins, drug-induced seizures) may lead to chronic epilepsy in survivors. Epidemiologic analyses show that a considerable time-delay occurs between the exposure of the brain to injury and the appearance of seizures. Such seizures are usually partial or mixed, may develop at any age, and are difficult to treat. In rats subjected to structural damage of the brain induced by sustained convulsions triggered by systemic administration of the cholinergic agent pilocarpine, spontaneous seizures may develop after a mean latency of 14-15 days. The mean frequency of spontaneous recurrent convulsions remains constant for several months. Evolution of these convulsions proceeds through several electrographic and behavioral stages resembling kindling. Kindling may be otherwise induced in rodents by repeated systemic administration of convulsants or by repeated electrical stimulation of sensitive brain regions. These observations demonstrate that structural damage of the brain may lead to spontaneously recurrent convulsions (chronic epilepsy) in rats and that kindling may be involved in the evolution of such a condition. This finding suggests that kindling mechanisms underlie the development of epileptic foci from structural brain lesions. Such mechanisms may be involved in the etiology of some forms of epilepsy in humans.",

      "title": "Aging and tardive dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome of abnormal, involuntary body movements, is produced by administration of antipsychotic drugs. The movements can involve the face, lips, jaw, tongue, neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Less obvious internal body regions can also be involved, such as the muscles of respiration. “Dyskinesia” is a generic term, referring to excessive or abnormal movements of any etiology or character. Historically, it has been used predominantly to refer to choreoathetoid-type movements; more recently it has also been used to include tics, dystonia, akathisia, myoclonus, and ballismus. Although tremors are also, by definition, abnormal movements, they have traditionally been recorded as a separate form of movement disorder. When an antipsychotic drug is believed to be the cause of the dyskinesia, the term “tardive” is employed. When an antipsychotic drug is implicated in the appearance of tremors, the term “drug-induced parkinsonism” is used. In general, it has been the rule that at least 3 months of neuroleptic treatment should precede any attribution of these drugs as causative agents in the development of tardive dyskinesia (Schooler & Kane, 1982), although recent work with older individuals suggests that shorter exposure times may be sufficient. The abnormal movements themselves can be distinguished phenomenologically by their rhythmicity, speed, and repetition, as well as by the presence or absence of sustained postures at the termination of the movement. Combinations of different movements are frequently seen, with parkinsonism, choreiform dyskinesia, and akathisia being among the most common in elderly patients.",

There is, as yet, no substantial evidence linking the more modern weight loss drugs, sibutramine and orlistat, to the aetiology of major depression.

Testing in clinical practice is best restricted to subgroups at high risk. The aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, clindamycin, erythromycin, polymyxins, and possibly ampicillin have the potential to aggravate neuromuscular disease.

While some patients with FMS respond to standard treatment with amitriptyline, pregabalin, or duloxetine in combination with outpatient multimodal pain management, there are still many who do not benefit sufficiently from this treatment or suffer intolerable side effects. Effective treatment options are therefore needed to supplement conventional therapies. Naltrexone is used in many countries as an off-label therapy in low doses for several chronic immunomodulatory disorders, including FMS. However, the strength of evidence from previous randomized controlled trials is low. I report a patient with severe FMS who did not respond to conventional therapy. Instead, low-dose naltrexone (LDN) (4.5 milligrams per day) resulted in a significant and sustained improvement in most FMS symptoms. The results of this case report suggest that an off-label use of LDN in severe refractory FMS may be a viable option. However, the information base is currently limited, and studies are conflicting.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

      "title": "Mechanism of emergence agitation induced by sevoflurane anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic used widely as a pediatric or outpatient anesthesia due to its excellent hemodynamic stability and low blood solubility, which allows rapid induction and emergence from general anesthesia, as well as control of the depth of anesthesia. However, when sevoflurane is used alone it is associated with a higher incidence of emergence agitation in children. The rapid removal of residual anesthetics due to low blood solubility of sevoflurane has been suggested to cause emergence agitation in some patients [1,2]. In addition, a variety of other explanations have been proposed for the etiology of emergence agitation. These include the lack of a young child's ability to adapt to sudden changes due to an unfamiliar environment after awakening, immature neurological development, anxiety from being separated from their parents, increased pain sensation and sympathetic hyperactivation [2,3].\r\n\r\nEmergence agitation is characterized by self-limiting aggressive agitation that develops in the early phase of awakening from anesthesia at the end of surgery. Emergence agitation can be dangerous to patients, particularly to young children. Patients suffering from emergence agitation may harm themselves and dislodge drains or catheters, which affects the results of surgery. They may inflict a bodily injury on their care-givers or cause a paranoiac accident, which makes the management and monitoring of patients at the post anesthesia care unit difficult [4]. There have been many attempts to reduce the incidence of emergence agitation but the etiology and preventive treatments of emergence agitation are still unclear.\r\n\r\nSome studies have reported that midazolam which acts on its target effect site GABAA, reduces emergence agitation [5,6], and its antagonist, flumazenil reverses this effect [7]. However, the mechanism is still not clear, and it is not known whether sevoflurane and midazolam interact at the GABAA receptor level. Most GABAA receptors consist of two α subunits, two β subunits and a γ subunit. The γ2 subunits of GABAA receptor exist as a long type (γ2L) and a short type (γ2S), generated by alternative splicing of RNA. The most common pattern for GABAA receptor is α1β2γ2 type, which accounts for 43% of all GABAA receptors [8]. This implies that the diversity of the subtype variants and the distribution of GABAA receptors may affect the anesthetics from subject to subject.\r\n\r\nIn this edition of the Korean journal of anesthesiology, Eom et al. [9] postulated that alternative splicing of the γ2 subunit is related to emergence agitation on the basis of characteristics of midazolam, sevoflurane and γ2 subunit. Sevoflurane binds to GABAA receptor, benzodiazepine-like midazolam prevents emergence agitation and also binds to α and γ subunit of GABAA receptor, and alternative splicing of γ2 subunit is different based on the age of the patient. Whole-cell patch clamp to the α1β2γ2L and α1β2γ2S GABAA receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells with midazolam and/or sevoflurane was performed. The concentration-response relationships were recorded for midazolam and sevoflurane. They showed that the concentration-response relationships for midazolam and sevoflurane were dose-dependent with no differences between the α1β2γ2L and α1β2γ2S subtypes. It was concluded that the difference in the γ2 subunit cannot explain the emergence agitation of sevoflurane in children in vitro.\r\n\r\nThese finding suggests that co-application of sevoflurane and midazolam enhances the GABA current according to the alternative splicing of the γ2 subunit and concentration of both drugs. Their effort to reveal the mechanism of emergence agitation induced by sevoflurane anesthesia could be a major step towards studying the basic mechanisms of the anesthetic agent. Further study to reveal the mechanism of emergence agitation is expected.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population. Gastric acid blockers, benzodiazepines, some antidepressants and opioid analgetics have been described in the review.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition that includes persistent widespread pain, fatigue, insomnia, non-restorative sleep, stiffness, cognitive disturbances, anxiety, and depressed mood. The disorder produces negative impacts on physical and social functioning, health related quality-of-life, emotional health and wellbeing, personal relationships, and the ability to complete daily work/life activities. It is considered to be a central sensitivity syndrome and a member of several overlapping conditions that produce diffuse pain such as chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, tension headache, myofascial pain syndrome, and restless legs syndrome. In order to address the illness and its related comorbidities, successful treatment plans are multidisciplinary, patient centered, individualized and multifaceted. Plans must be comprehensive and include disease education for patient and family members, lifestyle changes, aerobic exercise, dietary consults for weight reduction, sleep hygiene, strength training, cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, and perhaps complementary and alternative medicine-based therapies. There is good evidence to support the use of exercise to improve functioning and reduce symptoms. Amitriptyline, pregabalin, duloxetine, milnacipran, tramadol, and cyclobenzaprine have the best evidence for efficacy in reducing the symptoms and treating comorbidities. Some data exists supporting the use of acupuncture, mind-body interventions such mindfulness-based stress reduction, acceptance and commitment therapy, hypnosis, and biofeedback. Insufficient research is available for non-steroidal anti-inflammatories agents, acetaminophen and gabapentin. All other opioids, benzodiazepines, atypical psychotics and sedative hypnotics have no proven efficacy and are not a part of current FM treatment guidelines.",

Trastornos autonomicos como la dermatitis seborreica y los trastornos de la sudoracion, la fatiga, la perdida de peso o las alteraciones respiratorias (disnea, estridor inspiratorio) son sintomas muy prevalentes e incapacitantes, pueden ser el problema principal en alguna fase de la EP (fatiga, estridor) y condicionan la calidad de vida de los pacientes parkinsonianos. Es habitual no pensar en ellos y que no sean detectados por el medico. Aunque pueden responder a farmacos dopaminergicos, suelen precisar un enfoque terapeutico diferente. Son necesarios estudios que valoren nuevas perspectivas terapeuticas que actuen contra los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de estas alteraciones. Conclusiones. La EP afecta a otros sistemas distintos al dopaminergico nigroestriatal.

      "title": "Toxicology Rounds",
      "abstract": "Figure: serotonin syndrome, cyproheptadineFigureMedical toxicology is rife with procedures and treatments that satisfied clinicians' need to feel they were taking specific actions to benefit their patients but that later proved to be useless or even more dangerous, classic examples of intervention bias. An obvious example would be ipecac to induce vomiting. Another comes from the early 20th century when nonspecific analeptic central nervous system stimulating agents such as amphetamine and methylphenidate were administered to patients with barbiturate overdose to wake them. The medical outcomes with this approach were generally not good, and clinical outcomes improved markedly when it was replaced with a protocol emphasizing good supportive care, including intubation for airway protection and ventilation, the so-called Scandinavian method. Another intervention going out of fashion is cyproheptadine (Periactin) for serotonin syndrome, which results from excess stimulation of serotonin receptors in the CNS, most often caused by exposure to multiple serotonergic medications, although it has also been described after an overdose of a single agent. (See table.) The classic triad associated with serotonin syndrome includes altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular hyperactivity. (See table.) The complete triad may not be seen in mild early cases, and some toxicologists think a better term would be serotonin toxicity. Good Supportive Care Serotonin syndrome can be classified clinically as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild cases may present with tachycardia, tremors or clonus, sweating, and mydriasis but normal temperature. Moderate cases often have those findings plus hyperthermia. Symptoms of severe serotonin syndrome includes extreme autonomic instability, agitated delirium, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, renal insufficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and critical hyperthermia. Core temperature can exceed 41.1°C. (N Engl J Med. 2005;352[11]:1112.) Treating serotonin syndrome includes discontinuing precipitating drugs and providing good supportive care with volume repletion and benzodiazepines to control agitation and hyperactivity. Most mild cases are self-limited and resolve with treatment within 24 hours. In life-threatening severe cases, it is essential to control agitated delirium and rapidly reverse extreme hyperthermia. This often requires paralysis with nondepolarizing agents (avoid succinylcholine) and intubation with mechanical ventilation. Cyproheptadine, an antihistamine with antiserotonergic and anticholinergic properties, is considered third-line treatment for mild to moderate cases of serotonin syndrome. Despite more than two decades of published case reports, case series, and observational studies, no good data convincingly demonstrate the efficacy or benefit of cyproheptadine over standard care. A 1998 paper about five patients with serotonin syndrome treated with cyproheptadine concluded that further study was required before its widespread use could be recommended. (J Emerg Med. 1998;16[4]:615.) A recently published case series said the same. (J Clin Psychopharm. 2020;40[1]:95.) You'd think authors would realize that the additional research they demand will never take place. Problems and Unknowns A number of problems and unknowns are associated with using cyproheptadine in treating serotonin syndrome: Dosing: Even if cyproheptadine does provide some marginal benefit in these cases, the optimal dose is not known. The latest edition of Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies (11th edition, McGraw Hill: New York; 2019) suggests an initial dose of 12 mg followed by 2 mg every two hours in one chapter and a completely different dosing schedule of 8-16 mg every hour in another. In the case series above, the initial doses of cyproheptadine ranged from 4 to 42 mg. Indications: No specific indications exist for using cyproheptadine in these cases. Some authors recommend administering cyproheptadine if standard treatment with supportive care, benzodiazepines, and cooling do not produce an adequate response. But the reports do not explicitly define what constitutes standard treatment. Some papers consider diazepam 5 mg IV an adequate trial of benzodiazepines, but that dose can be virtually homeopathic in some cases, the therapeutic equivalent of spitting into the wind. Side Effects: Cyproheptadine is relatively safe in the low dose (4 mg) typically used to treat allergic symptoms, but it can produce anticholinergic side effects such as urinary retention. Cyproheptadine does cause sedation, but that is really a goal of treatment rather than an adverse effect. It is not clear to me whether the anticholinergic effects of large doses would impair efforts to lower a significantly elevated core temperature. Cyproheptadine is neither a real antidote nor a magic bullet for treating serotonin toxicity. It may provide some marginal benefit in reducing symptoms in mild cases. No evidence suggests that cyproheptadine is beneficial in severe serotonin toxicity, but there are theoretical concerns that it might cause harm. Our group has pretty much moved away from recommending cyproheptadine at all. We're not biased against intervention, but tend to favor measures based on good evidence and extensive clinical experience. Manifestations of Serotonin Syndrome Mental Status Abnormalities: Agitation, anxiety, restlessness, confusion Autonomic Instability: Tachycardia, diaphoresis, mydriasis, hyperthermia, hypertension Neuromuscular Hyperactivity: Tremor, shivering, trismus, hypertonicity, clonus, hyperreflexia, seizure, agitated delirium Dr. Gussowis a voluntary attending physician at the John H.

      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

Movement disorder emergencies include acute dystonia: sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements. Acute dystonia is a serious challenge for emergency room doctors and neurologists, because of the high probability of misdiagnosis, due to the presence of several mimickers including partial seizures, meningitis, localized tetanus, serum electrolyte level abnormalities, strychnine poisoning, angioedema, malingering, catatonia, and conversion. Methods: We describe 2 examples, accompanied by videos, of acute drug-induced oro-mandibular dystonia, both subsequent to occasional haloperidol intake. Results: Management and treatment of this movement disorder are often difficult: neuroleptics withdrawal, treatment with benzodiazepines, and anticholinergics are recommended.

These have been reported to occur in patients with hydrocephalus, intracranial tumors, and hypoxic, ischemic, or traumatic brain injury. They can be easily misdiagnosed as seizures, uncontrolled pheochromocytoma, drug withdrawal, thyroid storm, hypertensive crises, and sepsis or anxiety attacks. The most effective treatment to control these symptoms is yet to be identified. We present 2 individuals exhibiting these sympathetic surges; one whose symptoms were controlled with phenobarbital and the other with clonidine and oxycodone. Palliative medicine physicians should be made aware of this unusual complication.",

In most of the cases, patient’s psychosis developed after addition of Pramipexole and exacerbated after increasing the dosage. However there has been no case report in which Pramipexole has caused psychosis at lowest starting dose without any add on drug. Here we present a case of PD in which dyskinesia and psychosis appeared with first dose of Pramipexole, as low as 0.125mg. The patient was a 76 year old man with a one year history of PD. One year back patient observed tremors in his hand and slowing of movements. The neurologist prescribed Syndopa plus - 125, Benzhexol (schedule also same as Syndopa) and Pramipexole 0.125 mg at bedtime. The patient decided to start all medicines next day except Pramipexole (125mg) which he took at bed time. Within half an hour, patient started having visual and auditory hallucinations, along with abnormal movements and myoclonic jerks of hand, feet and mouth. He could be seen doing movements as if he is inserting needle in thread. According to him, he could visualize thieves trying to steal his car. Dechallenge with Pramipexole led to complete resolve of psychotic symptoms. After 4 weeks of therapy, there was a gradual but steady improvement in dyskinesia and tremors except slurring in speech.",

Psychopharmacology failed as a scientific paradigm when depression and schizophrenia became pipelines for billions of dollars in profit for the pharmaceutical industry. Also, antipsychotics like Smith Kline’s chlorpromazine, which marketed in the United States in 1954, caused movement disorders as a significant side effect. Finally, the real story of the atypicals shows how psychopharmacology was downgraded through the conversion of science into commerce.

      "title": "A Review of the Biological Mechanisms of Dexmedetomidine for Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Postoperative neurocognitive disorders are common neurological complications following surgery that are generally characterized by varying degrees of cognitive impairment. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders can exhibit as short-term postoperative delirium and/or long-term postoperative cognitive dysfunction. In addition, postoperative neurocognitive disorders may result in poor outcomes in patients, and are a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Recently, there has been a heightened interest in mechanisms and clinical treatments for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. Though some influencing factors and mechanisms of postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been revealed, they remain troublesome problems in clinical departments. Dexmedetomidine is a commonly used anesthetic adjuvant that may help improve postoperative cognitive impairment, especially the conditions of a postoperative acute event (postoperative delirium, within 1 week after operation) and delayed neurocognitive recovery (postoperative cognitive dysfunction, up to 30 days). In the recent literature, dexmedetomidine has been shown to exert positive effects on cognitive impairment in clinical and animal studies, especially for postoperative neurocognitive disorders. However, not all clinical findings support this efficacy. Though some mechanisms of dexmedetomidine on postoperative neurocognitive disorders have been proposed, such as signaling pathways associated with inflammation and apoptosis, this evidence is fragmentary and disputed in the literature. Therefore, this article aims to review the potential biological mechanisms underlying dexmedetomidine's effects on postoperative neurocognitive disorders, providing a reference for future studies.",

Evidence shows that intravenous lidocaine is most effective for neuropathic pain of peripheral origin. It can be tried for all conditions suspected of having components of neuropathic pain or where central sensitization may be present. Animal models of neuropathic pain and the capsaicin model in humans have indicated that the sympathetic nervous system may be involved in the development and maintenance of pain. Intravenous phentolamine has been shown to produce pain relief in some patients with chronic pain. Intravenous opioids are indicated for use in nonacute pains that are not responsive to other treatments.",

Care must be taken to ensure that inattention and hyperactivity are not manifestations of other behavioural pathology seen in association with autistic disorder, as this will affect treatment decisions. The prescribing of psychotropic agents to individuals with autistic disorder is increasing but the evidence base is limited, with some exceptions, to uncontrolled studies. Substantial benefit in reducing inattention and hyperactivity is seen with atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and quetiapine, although weight gain and sedation are common side effects. Moderate benefit is derived from methylphenidate, atomoxetine, some anticonvulsant medications, guanfacine and donepezil.

Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor.

      "abstract": "Abstract Upper extremity impairment rarely is assessed using grip strength, according to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), because results can be influenced by subjective factors that are difficult to control, including sex, age, comorbidities, fatigue, handedness, time of day, pain, and the individual's cooperation. The AMA Guides, Section 16.5b, Impairment Evaluation Methods, discusses the approach used for rating peripheral nerve injuries, but this section applies only to specific nerve lesions with resulting weakness of the muscles supplied or sensory changes. Strength correlates only poorly with performance of the activities of daily living, and grip strength testing using a dynamometer or other types of isometric strength testing has not been shown to reliably discriminate between submaximal and maximal efforts. Grip strength usually is not used in the presence of decreased motion, painful conditions, deformities, or absence of body parts (eg, missing digit), nor is it used to rate weakness from a peripheral nerve lesion. In rare cases, the AMA Guides allows the use of loss of strength (eg, due to a severe muscle tear that healed leaving a palpable muscle defect). Impairment ratings based on objective anatomic findings take precedence, and loss of strength is rarely combined and only if based on unrelated etiologic or pathomechanical causes.",

      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

      "title": "Combination of Electroconvulsive Therapy and Clozapine in the Treatment of Malignant Catatonia: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract A woman with treatment-resistant mania and malignant catatonia failed to respond to several of the conventional treatments including electroconvulsive therapy but showed a marked response to a combination of clozapine (250 mg daily) and electroconvulsive therapy within a few days of initiating treatment. Key words: Antidepressive agents, tricyclic; Catatonia; Combined modality therapy; Electroconvulsive therapy; Schizophrenia [TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] Introduction Catatonia is a syndrome characterised by motor signs such as posturing, catalepsy, waxy flexibility, and rigidity. Behaviour may change suddenly, ranging between extremes of excitement and stupor, and may include staring, negativism, impulsivity, mannerisms, stereotypy, echolalia, echopraxia, and automatisms. (1,2) The severity of catatonia ranges from mild to lethal. Stauder first applied the term 'lethal catatonia' in 1934 to describe a life-threatening syndrome characterised by mounting fever, intense excitement, diverse catatonic presentations, followed by stupor and death. At the 1992 American Psychiatric Association meeting, a new term, 'malignant catatonia', was suggested as a replacement for lethal catatonia, based on the perception of decreasing mortality in this condition. (3) Several authors have suggested use of the term 'simple or non-malignant catatonia' in the absence of autonomic instability or hyperthermia and 'malignant catatonia' when these symptoms are present. (1,2) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome was first reported in the 1960s as a rare but potentially lethal complication of antipsychotic medication use. (4) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is clinically indistinguishable from malignant catatonia in many cases and it is speculated by many authors that it is an iatrogenic form of malignant catatonia. (5) As a result, the term 'neuroleptic-induced catatonia' is also used to describe the condition. (1-3) Many investigators believe that catatonia is best understood as a final pathway for many central nervous system disorders and the only important difference is whether the syndrome arose spontaneously or whether it was triggered or accelerated by neuroleptic exposure. (4,6) Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods of treatment have been described in the literature. Ungvari et al (7) reviewed the pharmacological treatment of catatonia and concluded that benzodiazepines are an effective treatment for most of the symptoms and signs of catatonia. Patients who do not respond to benzodiazepines are treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). (2) In malignant catatonia, emergency ECT is the treatment of choice. General supportive measures such as maintaining fluid balance and nutrition are important. Although antipsychotics are generally not recommended during a catatonic phase, as the risk of precipitating neuroleptic malignant syndrome is considerably increased, they may have a role in treatment-resistant cases. (2) Case reports have described the effectiveness of clozapine, risperidone, and a combination of olanzapine and ECT. (8-10) We report a case of a woman in her fifties with treatment-resistant mania and malignant catatonia who failed to respond to several of the well-known treatments but showed a marked response and made a full recovery after treatment with a combination of ECT and clozapine. Case Report Mrs B was a 50-year-old caucasian, married and employed lady. Her son was diagnosed as having bipolar affective disorder and a learning disability. She had worked as a nurse for more than 10 years, and as a nursing manager for about 6 months, prior to the episode we describe. She had a history of alcohol misuse extending back for the last 30 years. She was admitted in July 2006 to an acute adult psychiatric unit after a mental health assessment initiated by the police. Two months prior to the psychiatric unit admission, she had been on holiday and had no symptoms suggestive of affective disorder at that time. …",

Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

      "title": "Clinical Pharmacological Issues in Treating Psychiatric Disorders of Patients with Mental Retardation",
      "abstract": "The following practical issues in psychopharmacotherapy of patients with mental retardation (MR) or other developmental disability (DD) are discussed, with some theoretical speculations: Persons with MR/DD have high rates of psychiatric disorders/symptoms, many of which are drug-responsive and not satisfactorily treated with other modalities alone. However, diagnosis is often complicated by concurrent multiple disorders (both psychiatric and medical/surgical), masking or distortion of symptoms, and communication impairments. Comorbidity and associated treatments should be considered in medication choice. Compared to psychiatric patients of normal IQ, patients with MR may be more sensitive to side effects and toxicity as well as responsive to lower doses, possibly related to less neuronal substrate, qualitative brain differences, or developmental stage. Unexpected or disappointing drug responses may also be related to such statistical quirks as \"end-of-curve\" phenomena. Ripples, ratcheting, and other ecobehavioral considerations influence treatment outcome and drug management. Target symptoms and expected drug benefits should be defined in consultation with caregivers as well as, when possible, the patient. Because drug responses of patients with MR are especially unpredictable, unreliable, sensitive to dose, and fraught with side effects, each medication trial might ideally be approached as a single-subject experiment on a compassionate protocol: quantify the baseline with ratings, behavior counts or other objective measures; start low and titrate slowly; monitor progress with repeated objective measures.",

      "title": "Postconcussion Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "Wilson disease—treatment perspectives",
      "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder caused by pathological tissue copper accumulation with secondary damage of affected organs (mainly, but not limited to, the liver and brain). The main clinical symptoms of WD are, in concordance with the pathogenesis, hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric. Current treatment options for WD, based on drugs leading to negative copper body balance like chelators or zinc salts, were introduced more than 40 years ago and are generally effective in the majority of WD cases if used lifelong. However, especially in neurological patients, treatment may lead to neurological deterioration, which is often irreversible. Further, almost 50% of neurologically affected WD patients present with persistent neurological deficits despite the use of anti-copper treatment. In addition, up to 30% of patients treated with the widely used drug, d-penicillamine, present with adverse events related to treatment, which often leads to treatment discontinuation. Finally, almost 25% of WD patients do not adhere with anti-copper treatment, partially due to drug-related adverse events and complex treatment regimens (3 times daily, before meals, etc.). These limitations with current treatments have led to the search for other WD treatment possibilities. Currently, research is mainly focused on: (I) new agents with better safety profiles and less neurological deterioration properties compared with traditional chelators, e.g., tetrathiomolybdate salts or central nervous system—penetrable trientine, with the aim to provide more effective copper removal from brain tissue; (II) other non-chelating drugs that lead to removal of copper from cells [e.g., methanobactin (currently in preclinical studies)]; (III) cell and gene therapy. In this article, current research on future treatments for WD is reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cyclosporine and tacrolimus belong to the immunosuppressive drugs of the calcineurin inhibitors group. They are widely used in the treatment of patients after organ transplants. One of their complications is neurotoxicity, the mechanism of which is still not fully understood. The main risk factor for neurotoxicity is hypertension. The most common symptoms include muscle tremors, which are more common in the upper limbs, as well as migraine headaches and peripheral neuropathies. The diagnosis of neurotoxicity is based on imaging tests (magnetic resonance imaging being the most commonly used) and assessment of clinical symptoms. Preventive measures should be initiated as soon as possible to prevent permanent damage to the nerve tissue. The possible preventive methods include reduction of the dose of the administered drug, temporary or complete discontinuation of drugs, or conversion to another immunosuppressive drug. It is also essential to monitor the patient’s condition, correct hypertension, electrolyte disturbances, and fight possible infections. So far, effective methods of preventing calcineurin inhibitor-induced neurotoxicity have not been demonstrated.",

      "title": "Case report: Hyperactive delirium after a single dose of zolpidem administered additionally to psychopharmacotherapy including clozapine",
      "abstract": "The non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem is frequently administered as a short term psychopharmacotherapy for insomnia. Although it is well-established in a broad clinical routine and often well-tolerated, severe delirium and complex sleep behavior were reported in rare cases. Hereby, it remains unclear whether zolpidem's potential for delirium might be enhanced when combined with further psychopharmacotherapeutics. The present case report portrays a young male Caucasian inpatient with schizoaffective disorder, who was admitted due to severe hyperactive delirium after a single dose of zolpidem 10 mg that was administered in addition to already established psychopharmacotherapy including clozapine 200 mg/day, aripiprazole 15 mg/day and cariprazine 4.5 mg/day. In detail, disorientation, agitation, confabulations, bizarre behavior, and anterograde amnesia occurred shortly after ingestion of zolpidem and gained in intensity within a couple of hours. Once zolpidem was discontinued, the abovementioned symptoms subsided completely and did not reoccur. Since a clear temporal association could be drawn between the intake of zolpidem and the onset of hyperactive delirium, the present clinical experience should serve as a cautionary note for combining potent sedative-hypnotics and substances with anticholinergic properties, even in young adults in a good general condition. Moreover, our case argues for the necessity of further research into the pathomechanism of the interaction potential of non-benzodiazepines as zolpidem, especially with substances exerting anticholinergic properties, which are known for their potential to precipitate delirium. Therefore, the metabolic pathways of the concurrently administered substances should be further taken into account.",

      "title": "“Shooting pain” in lumbar radiculopathy and trigeminal neuralgia, and ideas concerning its neural substrates",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patients with radicular low back pain (radicular LBP, sciatica) frequently describe their pain as “shooting” or “radiating.” The dictionary meaning of these words implies rapid movement, and indeed, many sufferers report feeling pain moving rapidly from the lower back or buttock into the leg. But, others do not. Moreover, the sensation of movement is paradoxical; it is neither predicted nor accounted for by current ideas about the pathophysiology of radicular LBP. We have used a structured questionnaire to evaluate the sensory qualities associated with “shooting” and “radiating” in 155 patients, 98 with radicular LBP and 57 with trigeminal neuralgia, a second chronic pain condition in which shooting/radiating are experienced. Results indicated a spectrum of different sensations in different people. Although many sciatica patients reported rapid downward movement of their pain, even more reported downward expansion of the area of pain, some reported upward movement, and for some, there was no spatial dynamic at all. The velocity of movement or expansion was also variable. By cross-referencing sensations experienced in the sciatica and trigeminal neuralgia cohorts with known signal processing modes in the somatosensory system, we propose testable hypotheses concerning the pathophysiology of the various vectorial sensations reported, their direction and velocity, and the structures in which they are generated. Systematic evaluation of qualitative features of “shooting” and “radiating” pain at the time of diagnosis can shed light on the pain mechanism in the individual patient and perhaps contribute to a better therapeutic outcomes.",

      "title": "Citrullinemia Type I",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Citrullinemia type I (CTLN1) presents as a clinical spectrum that includes an acute neonatal form (the classic form), a milder late-onset form (the non-classic form), a form without symptoms or hyperammonemia, and a form in which women have onset of severe symptoms during pregnancy or post partum. Distinction between the clinical forms is based on clinical findings and is not clear-cut. Infants with the acute neonatal form appear normal at birth. Shortly thereafter, they develop hyperammonemia and become progressively lethargic, feed poorly, often vomit, and may develop signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Without prompt intervention, hyperammonemia and the accumulation of other toxic metabolites (e.g., glutamine) result in increased ICP, increased neuromuscular tone, spasticity, ankle clonus, seizures, loss of consciousness, and death. Children with the severe form who are treated promptly may survive for an indeterminate period of time, but usually with significant neurologic deficits. The late-onset form may be milder than that seen in the acute neonatal form, for unknown reasons. The episodes of hyperammonemia are similar to those seen in the acute neonatal form, but the initial neurologic findings may be more subtle because of the older age of the affected individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CTLN1 is established in a proband with elevated plasma ammonia concentration (>150 µmol/L; may range to ≥2000-3000 µmol/L) and plasma citrulline concentration (usually >1000 µmol/L) and/or by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ASS1 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Acute management of hyperammonemia involves rapidly lowering plasma ammonia concentration using pharmacologic nitrogen scavenger therapy (sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, and arginine) or hemodialysis, if scavenger therapy fails; reversal of catabolism via intravenous glucose infusion and intralipids or protein-free enteral nutrition, if tolerated; and control of intracranial pressure. Chronic management involves lifelong dietary management to maintain plasma ammonia concentration lower than100 µmol/L and near-normal plasma glutamine concentration; oral administration of sodium phenylbutyrate or glycerol phenylbutyrate; L-carnitine to prevent systemic hypocarnitinemia. Liver transplantation, the only known cure for CTLN1, is best performed between age three months (and/or attainment of 5 kg body weight) and one year to decrease complications and improve survival; liver transplantation does not reverse any neurologic sequelae present at the time of transplant. Prevention of secondary complications: Medical attention during intercurrent infections to prevent hyperammonemia; routine vaccinations including annual influenza vaccine. Surveillance: Routine follow up in a metabolic clinic; monitoring for hyperammonemia and secondary deficiency of essential amino acids; monitoring older individuals for signs of impending hyperammonia (i.e., mood changes, headache, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, refusal to feed, ankle clonus) and elevated plasma glutamine concentration. Monitoring should be frequent in neonates and infants, based on disease severity, but may be extended to every six months to annually in older individuals, depending on clinical stability. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Excess protein intake; exposure to communicable diseases. Evaluation of relatives at risk: In utero diagnosis if the pathogenic variants in the family are known permits appropriate oral therapy beginning with the first feeds. Alternatively, sibs should be evaluated on day one of life by measurement of plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline; elevation of either above acceptable levels (ammonia >100 µmol/L or plasma citrulline >~100 µmol/L) is sufficient evidence to initiate treatment. Genetic counseling Citrullinemia type I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

      "title": "Postcardiotomy Delirium: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "title": "Psychotomimetic effects of PCP, LSD, and Ecstasy: pharmacological models of schizophrenia?",
      "abstract": "Facts box Phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine, D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) have been variously referred to as schizophrenomimetics, psychotogens, or psychotomimetics. There have been many reports that these drugs can induce psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, formal thought disorder, or catatonia-like abnormalities) in the absence of delirium. here is abundant evidence that PCP induces psychotic disorder beyond the acute symptoms of intoxication. There is no clear evidence that either LSD or MDMA induces psychotic disorder, let alone schizophrenia, in individuals who did not have vulnerability to schizophrenia premorbidly. PCP and ketamine are noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor that bind at the intrachannel site of the receptor to prevent calcium ion flux into the cell. LSD is a serotonin-like hallucinogenic indoleamine that acts as an agonist at the serotonin-subtype-2A (5HT2A) receptor, and MDMA is an indirect serotonin agonist. Rodent and primate models induced by PCP and analogues have been presented as models of human schizophrenia, with construct validity, showing homologous behavior, cognitive deficits, alterations in regional brain activation, and underlying neuronal dysfunction, to PCP-induced psychotomimetic effects in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia. Ketamine is considered to be a safe and valid model of PCP psychosis and applicable to preclinical human studies. More translational science is needed to relate animal findings to humans and vice versa. In this chapter, the potential role of glutamatergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is examined from the perspective of the psychotomimetic effects of i) phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor that bind at the intrachannel site of the receptor to prevent calciumion flux into the cell; ii) D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a serotonin-like hallucinogenic indoleamine that acts as an agonist at the serotonin-subtype-2A (5HT2A) receptor; and iii) 3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), an indirect serotonin agonist.",

Infants and children are most frequently affected. The lesions are a sclerous scar with or without a damage of the neural trunk. The clinical aspect is that of an algo-paralysis. Medical treatment by vitamins, alphachymotrypsine and physiotherapy must be applied early and during two months to have a chance bringing recovery. If it fails, surgical neurolysis is then necessary.

      "title": "SPTLC1-Related Hereditary Sensory Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SPTLC1-related hereditary sensory neuropathy (HSN) is an axonal form of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy distinguished by prominent early sensory loss and later positive sensory phenomena including dysesthesia and characteristic lightning or pains. Loss of sensation can lead to painless injuries, which, if unrecognized, result in slow wound healing and subsequent osteomyelitis requiring distal amputations. Motor involvement is present in all advanced cases and can be severe. After age 20 years, the distal wasting and weakness may involve proximal muscles, possibly leading to wheelchair dependency by the seventh or eighth decade. Sensorineural hearing loss is variable. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SPTLC1-related HSN is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SPTLC1 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Clean and protect wounds on neuropathic limbs; surgical treatment similar to that for leprosy; ankle/foot orthotics for foot drop; arthrodesis for Charcot joints; pregabalin, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or amitryptiline, or a combination of an antiepileptic drug and an antidepressant drug for shooting pains. Prevention of secondary complications: Routine care by a diabetic foot care specialist to prevent/treat calluses and foot ulcers; education about good skin care and burn prevention (e.g., to hands when cooking). Surveillance: At least daily inspection of feet for injuries or sources of wear. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Opiates as SPTLC1-related HSN is a chronic disorder. Genetic counseling SPTLC1-related HSN is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most probands have an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the SPTLC1 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family.",

      "title": "Available therapies and current management of fibromyalgia: Focusing on pharmacological agents",
      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic medical condition characterized by physical, psychiatric and psychological symptoms. Widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, heightened sensitivity, morning stiffness, decreased volition, depressed mood and a history of early abuse are frequently reported by patients with FM. Treatment of fibromyalgia is multidisciplinary, with an emphasis on active patient participation, medications, cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical modalities. No single medication has yet been found to sufficiently control all the symptoms of FM; currently available medication classes include antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, sedatives, muscle relaxants, analgesics, hypnotic agents and anticonvulsants. Hence, treatment for patients with FM, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, should be individualized based on each patient's clinical history, target symptoms and functional impairments. Although nonpharmacological modalities are also frequently used, recent research has focused on identifying more effective pharmacological treatments, particularly antidepressants and anticonvulsants. Furthermore, several new pharmacological agents have been now officially approved for the treatment of patients with FM. Thus, the purpose of this review is to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about the appropriate use of a number of pharmacological treatments for patients with FM.",

Two patterns - one consisting in catalepsy, posturing, mutism and negativism and a second consisting of echophenomenon, automatic obedience, verbigeration, and other stereotypies - have been abstracted. Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas. Viral and immune-mediated encephalitis were discharged. The MRI scan showed a right temporal medial lesion (amygdala atrophy). It will be addressed the hypothetical relationship between the dramatic clinical presentation and the cerebral lesion, grounded on the scientific research regarding limbic encephalitis, catatonic symptoms and neurophysiology. It will also be underscored the clinical relevance of differentiated psychopathology of catatonia.",

Presentation ... Pathophysiology Spinal cord injury releases spinal preganglionic sympathetic motor neurons below the level of the injury from descending control by the rostral CNS. A series of abnormal reflexes develop (e.g., the plantar reflex) as new synaptic circuits form in the independent cord below the lesion. In some cases, a reflex arc develops and any form of sensory stimulus may cause a massive sympathetic discharge. Most commonly, this reflex is triggered by stretch of a hollow organ like the bowel or bladder. Severe hyperreflexia is common (50–90%) when the spinal injury is above the T6 level, but hyperreflexia may occur when the injury is as low as T10. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Immediate Management ... Subsequent Management If long-term therapy is required, consider oral therapy with diazoxide, mecamylamine, or phenoxybenzamine.",

Pasadas cinco semanas de estancia hospitalaria fue dado de alta con antidepresivos y dosis estándar de benzodiazepinas, las cuales se retiraron ambulatoriamente, sin recurrencia de los síntomas durante un año de seguimiento. Conclusiones: Un episodio catatónico puede ser causado por trastornos afectivos. La catatonía secundaria a trastornos afectivos es rara en la práctica clínica, lo cual causa que pase inadvertida, por lo cual el conocimiento de esta alteración genera un manejo oportuno de pacientes reduciendo el gasto de los recursos del sistema de salud y mejorando la calidad de vida de la persona.

Compared with placebo, treatment with imipramine hydrochloride in a multiple crossover design using threeweek treatment periods led to improved performance on the memory task without either clinically apparent improvement in depression or significantly improved performance on the other tasks. These results may reflect the relative complexity of the memory task rather than a specific impairment of short-term memory, but the data do support the presence of cognitive dysfunction in depression, even in ambulatory patients without substantial impairments of attention or motor functioning. The results also indicate that antidepressant drugs can produce improvement in cognitive function, possibly as a forerunner of clinical improvement.",

The role of operant conditioning [learning] and cognitive factors [i.e., beliefs, perceptions of control, coping strategies] on the maintenance and exacerbation of pain and disability are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the effects of psychological factors on behavioral responses and physiological activity associated with pain.

We report the case of a male patient with SLE who presented with an exacerbation of bipolar disorder triggered by chloroquine. Firstly, when the patient was diagnosed with SLE, he underwent six months of therapy with chloroquine without any psychiatric symptoms. Later, the SLE returned and the patient was prescribed chloroquine again, without any mental illness. When the third exacerbation of SLE occurred, it coincided with a severe depressive episode with psychotic features that became aggravated for the first time after the administration of chloroquine. The chloroquine was subsequently replaced with hydroxychloroquine for the next six months without any behavioral problems, following which, the SLE and mood disorder were in remission. Later, a bipolar disorder relapse occurred, manifested by a manic episode, and in the following three months, despite psychiatric treatment, a manic episode with psychotic features developed four days after chloroquine was prescribed for arthritis. It was the second time that the mood disorder was exacerbated by chloroquine. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Our case points out that although chloroquine-induced psychosis is rare, patients presenting with behavioral changes need physicians’ attention in order to diagnose early and efficiently treat encountered mood disorders.",

We introduce the ideas of psychotomimetic compensation and psychotomimetic sensitization to explain this paradox. Psychotomimetic compensation refers to a stress or drug induced compensation against stress (see Fig 1) that is facilitated by engagement of neurotransmitter/modulator systems (endocannabinoid, serotonergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic) that mediate the effects of common psychotomimetic drugs (see Fig 3). Psychotomimetic sensitization occurs after repeated exposure to stress and/or drugs (Fig 3) and is evidenced by the gradual intensification and increase of psychotic-like experiences over time. Theoretical and practical implications of this model are discussed.",

Assessing drug levels in the blood is often helpful in confirming the adequacy of antidepressant dosages. Augmentation of the pharmaceutical activity can be achieved by coadministration of lithium, triiodothyronine, and/or stimulants. Neuroleptics are also prescribed with the antidepressant when psychotic features accompany depression. Such enhancements to drug efficacy are usually an advantage over beginning a new medication because of shorter response time. When a decision is made to change the antidepressant, a structurally different option is more likely to induce a remission than a medication of similar configuration. Electroconvulsive therapy is the most powerful treatment choice for depressed patients, especially when suicidal or psychotic features are present.",

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

Literature implicating these drugs in impaired driving is also reviewed. A series of 104 incidents in which these drugs were detected in the blood of drivers involved in accidents or arrested for impaired driving was considered, with respect to the analytical toxicology results, patterns of drug use in these subjects, the driving behaviors exhibited, and the symptoms observed in the drivers. Symptomatology and driving impairment were consistent with other CNS depressants, most notably alcohol. Reported driving behaviors included erratic lane travel, weaving, driving slowly, swerving, stopping in traffic, and hitting parked cars and other stationary objects. Drivers on contact by the police displayed poor balance and coordination, horizontal gaze nystagmus, bloodshot eyes, unsteadiness, slurred speech, slow responses, tendency to doze off or fall asleep, difficulty standing, walking or exiting their vehicles, and disorientation. Many of these cases had alcohol or other centrally acting drugs present also, making difficult the attribution of the documented impairment specifically to carisoprodol and meprobamate. In 21 cases, however, no other drugs were detected, and similar symptoms were present. Impairment appeared to be possible at any concentration of these two drugs; however, the most severe driving impairment and most overt symptoms of intoxication were noted when the combined concentration exceeded 10 mg/L, a level still within the normal therapeutic range.",

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "title": "Moving psychopharmacological drug development to the developing world",
      "abstract": "For a medical discipline to progress, there should be advances not only in the understanding of disease, but also in the treatment thereof. There were spectacular breakthroughs in the treatment of psychiatric disorders in the middle decades of the 20th century; these were the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy, mood stabilizers, neuroleptics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines.[12] With the exception of the rediscovery of clozapine,[3] subsequent advances heralded improvements in acceptability and tolerability but not necessarily overall efficacy.[4] Examples of such advances were the introduction of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other newer antidepressants, and the introduction of the atypical antipsychotics. Whereas there has been good news on some fronts, such as the introduction of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction and the introduction of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for dementia, the psychopharmacological management of major mental illness has hit a brick wall.[56] There have been unimpressive or disappointing results with innovative treatments such as S-adenosyl methionine, L-methylfolate, omega-3 fatty acids, glutamatergic agents, neuropeptides and many others. This has even resulted in opinion being expressed that the future of psychopharmacology in schizophrenia appears bleak[5] and that the pipeline for psychiatric drugs has run dry.[7] Without a proper understanding of the pathophysiology underlying major mental illness, treatment breakthroughs must rely on serendipity. Subsequent drug development would likely target incremental advances, based on me-too approaches. However, me-too approaches cannot be indefinitely pursued and there is a limit to how commercially successful such me-too drugs will be. There is a long list of other reasons, as well, why research and development of neuropsychiatric drugs is difficult and economically challenging.[8] Many leading multinational pharmaceutical companies are therefore downsizing or abandoning their neuropsychiatric drug development program because the enormous cost of researching a drug and bringing it to the market is economically unviable when there is no assurance that the drug will be approved by the regulatory authorities, or that it will subsequently succeed.[8] Cariprazine is a recent example; the USA Food and Drug Administration acknowledged that the drug demonstrated efficacy but asked for more data on issues related to dosing and adverse effects. Generating the necessary data would be an additional financial burden with no certainty about future profitability. With this background, we suggest an audacious idea. So far, the vast majority of recent drugs have been discovered, developed, or both discovered and developed by pharmaceutical companies in the Western world. The costs have been very high due to the higher costs of living, higher manpower and infrastructural costs and higher legal risks in the West. All these costs are far lower in developing countries. Developing countries also have a rich history of traditional medicine that can be explored for new leads. It may therefore make sense for the drug development industry to move to developing countries, lock, stock and barrel. At present, drugs are developed in the West at formidable cost and afterwards marketed in developing countries. Under the new patent regime, generics of these cannot be marketed in developing countries until the patents expire; therefore, new drugs will be inaccessible or unaffordable to the poor across the world until the patents expire.[9] Consider the situation where the entire drug development process is shifted to developing countries. This would mean that the laboratory research as well as the Phases I, II and III clinical trials (and later, post marketing surveillance) could be completed at low cost for specific marketing in the countries of origin and in other participating countries. Later, Western markets can select the drugs in which they have interest and conduct local trials to meet their local regulatory requirements at a much lower risk of regulatory challenges, regulatory failures and post marketing failures. This is a win-win situation for everybody: Costs will be low, accessibility will be high and the pharmaceutical industry will be more willing to invest in research and development initiatives instead of shutting the door on neuropsychiatric drug development. There is no need for a radical shakeup; the laboratory and clinical trial infrastructure, as well as the regulatory structure, is already in place in many developing countries, including India. With a little bit of initiative, these can be tweaked into readiness for the future. Some Indian pharmaceutical companies have already picked up the gauntlet; Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company is working on advanced drug delivery systems and Biocon is working on oral insulin as just two examples. It is hoped that there will be major initiatives in the neuropsychiatric segment, soon. Readers who are skeptical about whether or not this idea will work may wish to consider blonanserin, a drug that was developed in Japan, marketed in Japan and South Korea[10] and now made available in India at an affordable price. Blonanserin compares favorably in efficacy and adverse effect profile with haloperidol and risperidone.[1011] If blonanserin can be successfully developed to the Asian markets, why not other neuropsychiatric drugs? As a side note, the decision to limit the blonanserin market to Asia was unlikely to have been preplanned. A clinical trial[12] of blonanserin was conducted in Europe and the USA with a view to obtaining approval for marketing in the Western markets. However, this development was halted by the company in October 2008 because of investigational new drug inactivation. Perhaps the company preferred to focus on the development of its newer drug, lurasidone. Perhaps the company did not want blonanserin to compete with its own newer drug. Whatever the reason, however, the message is clear: A drug can be successfully developed, trialed and marketed in an Asian market. There is recent news that blonanserin is undergoing clinical trials for potential marketing in China, as well.[11] As a parting note: a possible way forward, at least for the moment, was outlined by McMahon and Insel:[4] the exploitation of pharmacogenomics toward personalized medicine. And afterwards, why not drugs that might represent real advances in the treatment of major mental illness, rather than merely me-too drugs? Therein lies the challenge.",

      "abstract": "Psilocybin/psilocin from so-called psychoactive mushrooms causes hallucinogenic effects. Especially for people with mental or psychiatric disorders ingestion of magic mushrooms may result in horror trips combined with the intention of self-destruction and suicidal thoughts. Automutilation after consumption of hallucinogenic mushrooms has already been described. Our case report demonstrates the suicide of a man by self-inflicted cut and stab injuries. A causal connection between suicidal behaviour and previous ingestion of psychoactive mushrooms is discussed.",
