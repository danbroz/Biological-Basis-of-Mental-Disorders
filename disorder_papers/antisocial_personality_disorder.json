      "title": "Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Abstract Child sexual abuse is typically defined as any sort of sexual contact between a child and an adult (or significantly older teenager), including sexual solicitation of, or exposure to, a child by an older person. It may include unwanted and inappropriate physical contact with the child's genitals; sexual touching, manipulation, or fondling; penetration in terms of vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse or attempted intercourse; as well as exposing children to sexual images or forcing them to watch pornography or to witness adult sexual acts. Child sexual abuse can vary along a number of dimensions, including pattern, frequency, duration, age at onset, and relationship of victim to perpetrator. Experience with and exposure to sexual abuse in childhood are particularly associated with long‐term psychological effects and profoundly shape victims' lives well into adulthood by increasing the probability of negative psychological outcomes such as poor self‐esteem, lack of a sense of control or agency, and associated mental disorders. The level of harm may be affected by multiple factors such as duration and frequency of abuse, use of force, and penetration, and the social stigma of child sexual abuse often compounds the psychological harm to children.",

      "title": "Family factors associated with conduct disorders in Children and Adolescents.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Conduct disorder is a disorder initially diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and\r\nrefers to a persistent pattern of antisocial behavior in which the individual repeatedly\r\nbreaks social rules and carries out aggressive acts that upset other people. Antisocial\r\nbehavior is a common problem in the course of development of children. Although\r\nconduct disorder has been widely studied, it still consumes much of the resources of\r\nmental health, juvenile justice and the special education system. DSM-IV mentions\r\nconduct disorder as one of the most frequently diagnosed conditions in outpatient and\r\ninpatient mental health facilities for children 1 DSM- IV specifies for conduct disorder,\r\ncriteria which includes symptoms from the following areas: aggression against people\r\nor animals, property destruction, lying or theft and serious rule violation. It defines\r\nconduct disorder as a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic\r\nrights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated 2. About a\r\nthird of those affected have antisocial personality disorder in adult life and a further\r\nthird experience other personality, psychiatric and psychosocial problems. The\r\nprevalence of conduct disorders varies from 6-20% in studies across different cultures\r\nand settings 3, 4. In the evolution of conduct disorders different risk factors are\r\nimplicated which includes “child biological factors,” “child functional factors,” and\r\n“psychosocial factors” 5. Even though the number of studies discussing the evolution of\r\nconduct disorders and factors associated with it are numerous, there is a lack of\r\ninformation on risk factors associated with conduct disorder in our Indian population.\r\nIn this study we aim to delineate the family factors like parenting style, parental\r\nseparation, parental psychopathology, family type and family functioning associated\r\nwith conduct disorders.\r\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES : \r\nTo study the family factors associated with conduct disorder in a clinic-based\r\npopulation.\r\nTo study the family factors in children and adolescents diagnosed with conduct\r\ndisorder, in comparison with a group of children without conduct disorder, but with\r\nother psychiatric disorders.\r\nThe following null hypothesis was postulated:\r\nThere is no significant difference between children and adolescents with conduct\r\ndisorder and those without conduct disorder, with respect to family factors.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS : The participants were recruited from the outpatient department of the Child and\r\nAdolescent Psychiatry Unit, Department of Psychiatry, Christian Medical College. This\r\nis a tertiary care centre, providing services to children and adolescents with various\r\nmental health needs, from different parts of the country and neighboring regions. The\r\nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry unit of the Department has two divisions, one for\r\nchildren with emotional as well as behavioral disorders and the other one for children\r\nwith developmental disorders. The multidisciplinary treating team makes the clinical\r\ndiagnosis based on the ICD-10 clinical diagnostic system.\r\n Inclusion criteria:\r\n1. Children and adolescents between 5 - 18yrs.\r\n2. Diagnosed to have conduct disorder based on the ICD-10 clinical diagnostic criteria\r\nat initial presentation.\r\n3. Conduct disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric disorders\r\n4. Conversant in English, Tamil or Hindi.\r\n\r\nRESULTS : The acceptability of the study data for a parametric analysis was initially assessed and\r\nfound to be favourable as depicted in Table 1.\r\n164 children and adolescents were enrolled for the study between January 2010 and\r\nOctober 2010. As diagnostic data was missing for 5 participants, only 159 participants\r\nwere considered for further analysis. Table 2 shows the participant characteristics of the total sample. The sample consisted\r\nof children and adolescents between the ages of 5 to 18 years with a mean age of 11.61\r\nyears (SD 3.5). Approximately three fourth of the participants were male (74.2%). The\r\nmajority had completed at least a primary or high school education (91.2%).\r\nParticipants were predominantly Hindus and hailed from a upper middle socioeconomic\r\nbackground. There was a slightly larger representation from urban areas (56.6%). The\r\nmajority was from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal (79.3 %), therefore spoke Tamil and\r\nBengali respectively. All the participants included whose mother tongue was Bengali,\r\nwere also conversant in Hindi.\r\nThere were 63 participants with conduct disorder which accounted for 30.6% of the\r\ntotal disorders seen. Among children with conduct disorder, 33.3% had conduct\r\ndisorder in the family context, 15.9% had socialized conduct disorder and oppositional\r\ndefiant disorder was seen in 50.85%.The majority (40%) of other diagnosis present in\r\nthe total sample included mild mental retardation and ADHD. ‘Other’ disorders\r\nincluded nonspecific behaviour problems and enuresis.\r\nCONCLUSION : In conclusion, while this study failed to find a significant association of family factors\r\nwith conduct disorder when a multivariate analysis was done, male gender and more\r\nnumber of comorbidities had a significant association with conduct disorder.",

      "title": "The Sexually Exploited Child",
      "abstract": "Sexual exploitation of children (under 14 years of age) is a common occurrence, although actual numbers are unknown. There are three major forms of sexual abuse: (1) incest, ie, sexual activity between consanguineous family members; (2) sexual assault, such as rape or molestation by adults not related to the child; and (3) habitual sexual exploitation for purposes of financial reward or perverse sexual satisfaction. Brother-sister incest has the highest incidence in the middle and upper socioeconomic levels and is probably the least damaging, psychologically, to sexual adjustment later in life. Father-daughter incest is more common in the lower socioeconomic levels and is thought to produce major disorders in the psychosexual area. Sexual assault of children, if handled supportively and with understanding by the surrounding adults, including parents, physicians, teachers, law enforcement officers, and others, can result in minimal sequelae; however, often the situation is handled with emotional reactions ranging from disgust to hysteria which result in the child's being victimized and traumatized unnecessarily. These latter situations lead to sexual acting-out in adolescence, promiscuity, perversions, or frigidity in adult sexual life. Teachers, physicians, and child welfare workers need to be attuned to the possibility to sexual abuse in the children they serve.",

      "title": "Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD‐11",
      "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been heated debate regarding whether compulsive sexual behaviour should be classified as a mental/behavioural disorder. Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been proposed for inclusion as an impulse control disorder in the ICD-111. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges, resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour over an extended period (e.g., six months or more) that causes marked distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern is manifested in one or more of the following: a) engaging in repetitive sexual activities has become a central focus of the person's life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; b) the person has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; c) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences (e.g., repeated relationship disruption, occupational consequences, negative impact on health); or d) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when he/she derives little or no satisfaction from it. Concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours are explicitly addressed in the diagnostic guidelines proposed for the disorder. Individuals with high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., due to a high sex drive) who do not exhibit impaired control over their sexual behaviour and significant distress or impairment in functioning should not be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. The diagnosis should also not be assigned to describe high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., masturbation) that are common among adolescents, even when this is associated with distress. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also emphasize that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based on psychological distress related to moral judgments or disapproval about sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that would otherwise not be considered indicative of psychopathology. Sexual behaviours that are egodystonic can cause psychological distress; however, psychological distress due to sexual behaviour by itself does not warrant a diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. Careful attention must be paid to the evaluation of individuals who self-identify as having the disorder (e.g., calling themselves \"sex addicts\" or \"porn addicts\"). Upon examination, such individuals may not actually exhibit the clinical characteristics of the disorder, although they might still be treated for other mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). Additionally, individuals often experience feelings such as shame and guilt in relationship to their sexual behaviour2, but these experiences are not reliably indicative of an underlying disorder. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also assist the clinician in differentiating compulsive sexual behaviour disorder from other mental disorders and other health conditions. For example, although bipolar disorder has been found at elevated rates among individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder3, sexual behaviours must be persistent and occur independently of hypomanic or manic episodes to provide a basis for a possible diagnosis of the disorder. A diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be made when the behaviour can be explained by other medical conditions (e.g., dementia) or by the effects of certain medications prescribed to treat specific medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease)4 or is entirely attributable to the direct effects of illicit substances on the central nervous system (e.g., cocaine, crystal methamphetamine). Currently, there is an active scientific discussion about whether compulsive sexual behaviour disorder can constitute the manifestation of a behavioural addiction5. For ICD-11, a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming6. For this reason, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not included in the ICD-11 grouping of disorders due to substance use and addictive behaviours, but rather in that of impulse control disorders. The understanding of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder will evolve as research elucidates the phenomenology and neurobiological underpinnings of the condition7. In the absence of consistent definitions and community-based epidemiological data, determining accurate prevalence rates of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been difficult. Epidemiological estimates have ranged up to 3-6% in adults8, though recent studies have produced somewhat lower estimates of 1 to 3%9. The more restrictive diagnostic requirements proposed for ICD-11 would be expected to produce lower prevalence rates. In general, men exhibit the disorder more frequently than women, although robust data examining gender differences are lacking. Additionally, higher rates of the disorder have been noted among individuals with substance use disorders. Among treatment seekers, the disorder negatively impacts occupational, relationship, physical health and mental health functioning. However, systematic data are lacking regarding the prevalence of the disorder across different populations and associated socio-cultural and socio-demographic factors, including among non-treatment seekers. Growing evidence suggests that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is an important clinical problem with potentially serious consequences if left untreated. We believe that including the disorder in the ICD-11 will improve the consistency with which health professionals approach the diagnosis and treatment of persons with this condition, including consistency regarding when a disorder should not be diagnosed. Legitimate concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours have been carefully addressed in the proposed diagnostic guidelines. We posit that inclusion of this category in the ICD-11 will provide a better tool for addressing the unmet clinical needs of treatment seeking patients as well as possibly reduce shame and guilt associated with help seeking among distressed individuals. The proposed diagnostic guidelines will be tested in international multilingual Internet-based field studies using standardized case material, which will help to assess the generalizability of the construct across different regions and cultures, and clinicians' ability to distinguish it from normal variations in sexual behaviour and from other disorders. Additional field studies in clinical settings will provide further information about the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic guidelines for the disorder among clinical populations. Shane W.

Anxiety which arises over childhood abuse may be dealt with by compulsive or addictive behaviors. Repressed or forgotten abuse may manifest itself in adult life symptomatically by out-of-control behaviors which are abusive of self and/or others. Such compulsive behaviors reflect an attempt to gain mastery over the original abuse and the abuser. Keeping promiscuous behavior secret reinforces lhe original abuse pattern and leads to guilt, shame, and isolation. Countertransference issues facing the therapist are discussed.

Early onset predicts a long antisocial career. Since antisocial behaviour and risk taking is more prevalent in men, explanations may be biological as well as social. Antisocial individuals tend to be versatile in their behaviours, although early adulthood is characterised by a switch from group offending to lone offending. Overall, diversification in antisocial behaviours is seen up to the age of about 20, followed by gradual specialisation in particular types of antisocial behaviours, such as illicit use of drugs.2\n\nIndependent precursors of an antisocial lifestyle include antisocial child behaviour, impulsivity, school failure, an antisocial family, poor parenting, and economic deprivation.2 Turning points away from an antisocial lifestyle include getting a job, getting married, moving to a better area, …",

      "title": "Determinants of Juvenile Deviant Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Deviant behavior of minors manifests in various forms and with different degrees of intensity, influenced by external social environments and the individual characteristics of the minor's personality, which shape their reactions to various life challenges. Behavior that deviates from generally accepted expectations can be either constructive or destructive, and deviant behavior, accordingly, can be positive or negative. The evaluation of such behavior is based on the social consequences of the deviation. The article establishes that within the framework of criminological research, the focus is on negative deviant behavior of minors, which may result in criminal responsibility (in accordance with the Criminal Code of Ukraine) or may not lead to such responsibility (e.g., withdrawal from social contact, self-isolation, or avoidance of societal norms and interaction with others; behavior contrary to common communication norms, such as rudeness; alcohol consumption by minors, which may not yet lead to offenses but is socially unacceptable; behavior that violates aesthetic or moral standards but is not illegal, such as extreme forms of tattooing or piercing; protest behavior, for instance, ignoring traditions or deliberately breaking etiquette; or actions by minors that have the objective signs of criminal offenses, but the perpetrators have not yet reached the age of criminal liability). The article states that there is no single theory of deviant behavior, including among minors. However, all researchers agree on the following point: eliminating certain factors can significantly reduce the likelihood of deviant behavior, but only a systematic approach to addressing all determinants of deviance provides grounds to talk about a high probability of significantly reducing or partially eradicating such actions. Deviant behavior is a complex form of social behavior influenced by a range of interconnected factors. Thus, in each case of deviant behavior, it is insufficient to investigate only biological, psychological, or social factors. A comprehensive approach that considers all these factors together is necessary, as such behavior results from the unsuccessful socialization of youth: due to disruptions in the processes of identification and individualization, such individuals are prone to \"social disorganization,\" where cultural norms, values, and social ties are either absent, weakened, or in conflict with each other. It is important to create conditions for preventing negative deviant behavior, particularly through the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, fostering a favorable socio-psychological climate in the child's environment, and providing opportunities for personal self-realization in society.

It is assumed that the health consequences are worse if the abuse has been considered severe or if the child has been exposed to cumulative trauma, e.g. physical abuse or other stressful life events. However, symptom development seems to vary widely between individuals. According to developmental theories the dynamic interplay between environmental and individual conditions creates a course toward either healthy or maladaptive outcomes. Social support has been shown to have a strong influence, direct or indirect, on abuse sequelae – a higher amount of support is related to better psychological functioning. However, adult victims may have difficulties forming close relationships with others due to lack of trust and other abuse aftermath. Further, despite a high risk for ill-health victims often fail to disclose the abuse. If they do tell they are not rarely met by negative reactions, which has been related to worse outcome. Delayed disclosure is related to intrafamilial abuse, closeness to the perpetrator, multiple perpetrators, age at onset and severe abuse. The victim may experience a psychological disclosure dilemma: the need to tell in order to get support is weighed against the risk to receive negative reactions. Thus, the overall aim of the thesis was to contribute knowledge concerning the relationship between child sexual abuse, disclosure, social support, and subjective health in adult women reporting experiences of sexual child maltreatment. Methods. The thesis was based on a study with a cross-sectional design using retrospective data about abuse and disclosure experiences as well as current data about health and social support. Participants (n = 152, aged 20-60 years) were recruited by advertisements in a membership magazine published by a national organisation for sexually abused women providing activities for support and healing, as well as in staff magazines for municipal employees in the Stockholm area. Data was retrieved by both a semi-structured interview and questionnaires. Analyses included quantitative methods (variable-approach and person-approach) as well as qualitative methods. Results. The results showed that disclosure characteristics were more prominently related to health than sexual abuse characteristics. Moreover, in spite of experiences of severe abuse and negative reactions after disclosure it was possible to get access to health enhancing social support in adulthood. The relation between disclosure-related events and health was dependent on source and type of reaction, in favour of partner and friends. A positive reaction from a partner was strongly related to subjective health. It may be crucial for victims of CSA who have problems with trust and intimacy to get emotional support, acceptance and respect from a partner in overcoming these feelings. Further, two groups of women reporting good health in spite of severe abuse were found by cluster analysis. The groups were among other things characterised by a high proportion of women who had formerly been active members in the support organisation. A qualitative analysis of the member’s experiences from the organisation showed that a victim process altering the victim identity over time seemed to constitute an important part of the individual development. However, few members who had gone through crucial steps of the victim process seemed to remain in the organisation passing the knowledge on to new members, thus creating a chronic structural problem for the organisation to deal with. Conclusions. Social support is a crucial protective factor for victims of child sexual abuse, a group highly at risk for and ill-health and adverse outcome. Victims of child sexual abuse seek and receive social support in various ways depending on severity of abuse, timing of disclosure and choice of disclosure receiver. Thus, the whole disclosure process during life is important to consider when studying disclosure-related events in relation to social support and health. Further, different methods of analyses may contribute to the understanding of how risk and protective factors interact. Both variableand person-based methods pointed at the importance of resources like self-esteem and social support above the amount of risk factors for health outcome. Finding ways to combine self-help with professional help might be fruitful and constitutes a further challenge for psychiatry when it comes to the task of developing new and effective care for this group.",

      "title": "Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace",
      "abstract": "Workplace bullying and harassment is prevalent in contemporary workplaces with detrimental negative outcomes for targets as well as for bystanders and the organization itself. At any one time, some 3%–20% of the working population is targeted, suffering reduced motivation and productivity, severe mental and physical health problems, and a risk of exclusion from the organization and even working life altogether. Bullying and harassment is about the systematic and ongoing mistreatment of an employee by other organization members, mostly of a psychological and social nature and often involving a gradually escalating process that may end in severe victimization of those targeted if not properly managed and handled in its early phases. In early phases, by some denoted incivility, the behaviors involved are often subtle, indirect, and discrete, while in later phases they become ever more prevalent and direct—even involving threats and open verbal abuse. Bullying may involve work-related behaviors creating a difficult and even dangerous working situation for the target, personally demeaning behavior, acts of social exclusion and non-inclusion, and physically intimidation behaviors. Hence, bullying comes in many shades and forms, as well as at many levels of intensity. Although risk factors and antecedents of this complex problem may be found on many levels, factors in the immediate working environment and the design and management of work are particularly important. Furthermore, bullying is particularly prevalent in working environments characterized by a hostile working climate and in organizations where such behaviors are permitted or even rewarded.",

      "title": "Equitable Fraud: Material Exploitation in Domestic Settings",
      "abstract": "The security and well-being of older adults in the grey zone - not incapable but more vulnerable - is a key area of concern among practitioners and legislators. The diminished capability associated with disease may be gradual and spotty, a grey zone that can last for years. Other, non-medical factors are also significant: vulnerability arises by reason of an individual's total life situation, including relationships, education, experience, personality, and connection to society. Protecting the interests of the vulnerable but capable has been considered in terms of protection from abuse, and/or in terms of capacity. Each approach has significant conceptually structural problems. Unless a very narrow definition of is used (essentially replicating the criminal offences dealing with assault and theft) adult protection legislation has inappropriately paternalistic aspects; older adults are entitled to make objectively foolish choices, take risks, or prefer new, disreputable friends over older, staider ones. Older adults do not require protection from the consequences of their own choices, freely made. A finding of incapacity would resolve the difficulty by simply re-categorising the vulnerable person as incapable, a response that will often be excessive and result in an unwanted and unnecessary loss of independence. Modern least-intrusive adult guardianship legislation attempts to modify that all or nothing outcome through a scheme of graduated capacities. In reality neither paradigm - abuse or capacity - realistically captures or appropriately responds to the range of situations in which the vulnerable but capable adult requires the assistance and support of the law. Those situations are most accurately understood with reference to the conceptual framework of equitable fraud.",

      "abstract": "Sexual behaviors in children are common, occurring in 42 to 73 percent of children by the time they reach 13 years of age. Developmentally appropriate behavior that is common and frequently observed in children includes trying to view another person's genitals or breasts, standing too close to other persons, and touching their own genitals. Sexual behaviors become less common, less frequent, or more covert after five years of age. Sexual behavior problems are defined as developmentally inappropriate or intrusive sexual acts that typically involve coercion or distress. Such behaviors should be evaluated within the context of other emotional and behavior disorders, socialization difficulties, and family dysfunction, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Although many children with sexual behavior problems have a history of sexual abuse, most children who have been sexually abused do not develop sexual behavior problems. Children who have been sexually abused at a younger age, who have been abused by a family member, or whose abuse involved penetration are at greater risk of developing sexual behavior problems. Although age-appropriate behaviors are managed primarily through reassurance and education of the parent about appropriate behavior redirection, sexual behavior problems often require further assessment and may necessitate a referral to child protective services for suspected abuse or neglect.",

      "title": "Stigma and Disadvantage",
      "abstract": "Stigma is the devaluation of an individual or group that is based on social identity and leads to status loss and other negative outcomes. Although there are variations in the manifestation of stigma, the existence of stigma is pervasive, transcending time and culture. Moreover, stigma has the potential to cause profound harm across virtually every facet of a stigmatized person’s life. At the same time, there is tremendous variation across individuals and groups in the experience of stigma. Stigmas vary in concealability, the circumstances under which they originate, and the extent to which they change over time, interfere with social interactions, are considered disgusting, and are perceived as posing a danger to others. Functional approaches to stigma posit that stigma can serve to encourage the exploitation of outgroups for ingroup gain, enforce norms within a group, or encourage disease avoidance behaviors. Stigma is enacted at a structural level when societal norms, laws, and policies harm the ability of stigmatized groups to access resources and safety. Interpersonal stigma occurs when stereotypes, prejudice, and other negative biases lead individuals to intentionally or unintentionally discriminate against members of stigmatized groups. The hallmark characteristic of a stigma approach to the study of inequality and disadvantage is a focus on the psychological experience of people who belong to stigmatized groups. People who belong to stigmatized groups are generally aware of their disadvantaged status and the devaluation of their group. This awareness sets the stage for a variety of psychological processes to unfold including felt stigma, internalized stigma, anticipated stigma, and social identity threat. People who experience stigma cope with the stress posed by stigma in a variety of ways. Three well-established mechanisms for coping with stigma include identifying with the group, distancing from the group, and engaging in collective action to improve the status of the group. Stigma can influence a variety of life outcomes including, but not limited to, health and well-being, interpersonal relationships, education, and work outcomes. Interventions can both reduce the prevalence of stigma and mitigate the harmful consequences of stigma.",

Alternatively, the court may request the therapy records of someone who has faced criminal charges, perhaps for substance use, in an effort to determine if the client is following through on the court's requirements, such as regular therapy sessions or abstinence from drugs and alcohol. In addition to the “one-up” issue, consider that many clients may be seeing a therapist because they have issues with trust or boundaries. Additionally, engaging in a business relationship before or after seeing the client in therapy constitutes a dual relationship. The APA code of ethics defines multiple relationships, forbids sexual ones, and recommends that a therapist avoid any dual relationship that can potentially “impair the psychologist's objectivity, competence or effectiveness in performing his or her functions as a psychologist”.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a mental and / or physical state of addiction to certain psychoactive substances, behaviors or situations. They can be different, and each has its own significance, degree of intensity, psychological, social and economic dimensions. Alcohol is considered to be the most commonly abused substance in Europe, including Croatia. No celebration from the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans until today has passed without the consumption of alcohol. Also, alcohol is considered to be the first psychoactive substance that people encounter, specifically young people aged 14 years. Alcoholism is an addiction to alcohol, while an alcoholic according to the definition of the World Health Organization is a person who has become addicted to alcohol through long-term drinking, mentally, physically or in both ways and has developed mental or physical impairments and social difficulties accessible to traditional medical and social diagnostic procedures. The clinical picture of alcoholism is first manifested in the very appearance of the alcoholic, and then in his change of personality, which in turn leads to the deterioration of their own health, relationships in the family and in society, job loss. All of the above components can contribute to the worsening of the condition. The diagnosis of alcoholism is made on the basis of anamnestic data of disease symptoms, medical examination, heteroanamnestic data, which are most often given by family members, laboratory tests and various questionnaires. Alcoholism treatment consists of treatment that includes strict abstinence and lifestyle changes, then outpatient treatment and inclusion in self-help and mutual aid groups such as Alcoholics Clubs and Alcoholics Anonymous. This paper will consist of two parts. In the first part I will define the concept of alcoholism, explain the epidemiology and etiology of alcoholism, then the effects of alcohol on the body, the clinical picture of alcoholism, diagnosis, treatment, consequences of alcoholism and the role of the nurse in people addicted to alcohol. The second part consists of a survey questionnaire conducted online using the Google Docs application. The main goal of the research was to determine whether alcoholism is still the leading harmful habit in the 21st century.",

The social worker is confronted by such issues as—how can one help a person who rejects the intrusion of others in his life, without diminishing the dignity of that individual? How can one avoid the autocratic qualities of direction and the threatening constraint over behaviour which can not only demean, but also rob a person of making an unfettered choice? Is it possible to aid constructively the development of attitudes which line up with what society demands, when, for example, the individual knows that his liberty or the receipt of welfare assistance, or the custody of members of his own family, is contingent on his strict conformity with the advice of the social worker? Is there ethical justification for involvement in a situation where the client cannot withdraw without often serious personal loss and where frequently there is not full comprehension on his part of what conditional liberty, or the granting of assistance, or compliance with social sanction, means by way of his own commitment to the relationship?",

They are not cognitively deficient, socially isolated, or lonely, nor do they drain society's resources. They are aging well, and to the extent that they are able to engage in valued activities, they will continue to do so. A key component of adapting to growing older is the ability to maintain the sense of personal control that can be threatened by normal aging processes. The Activity Restriction Model of Depressed Affect proposes that to age successfully is to maintain physical and cognitive functioning via engagement in personally meaningful activities. Indeed, activity restriction—or the inability to continue normal activities that often follows stressful life events such as debilitating illness—is a major factor in poorer mental health outcomes. Potential contributors to activity restriction and depression are identified. Interventions to reduce activity restriction in older adults should focus on promoting manageable activities, taking into consideration individual differences in functional, psychological, and social resources.",

      "abstract": "Health professionals have a responsibility to become informed and raise community awareness about the nature of bullying and its link to serious health risks.The term \"bullying\" refers to a group of aggressive behaviors to which one person is exposed repeatedly and over time by one or more others.Bullying encompasses physical aggression (hitting, pushing, punching, or kicking); verbal harassment (threatening, teasing, name calling, or making faces or dirty gestures); and indirect or relational mistreatment (ignoring someone or excluding him or her on purpose).Daring a person to perform a dangerous, illegal, or inappropriate action under the threat of losing approval among the members of a group is also considered a form of bullying.What is understood as bullying varies according to human developmental stages and cultures.Many people may have experienced or witnessed bullying behaviors during childhood and adolescence that were then regarded as part of growing up or a rite of passage.Today, published evidence supports the view that bullying is a very toxic form of abuse prevalent across the lifespan on a global scale.It occurs not only in schools, but over the Internet and cellular phones, in the neighborhood, at summer camp, at home between siblings, as hazing among young adults in colleges or the armed forces, and in the workplace.During the last 2 decades, bullying episodes have been linked to hundreds of deaths due to suicide, accidental injuries, and homicide.Adolescents who are bullied and those who bully others are often subject to other serious health, safety, and educational risks including emotional and physical symptoms; eating disorders; self-inflicted, accidental, and perpetrated injuries; abusing over-the-counter medication; hurting people on purpose; and frequent absenteeism.Bullying at the workplace has been linked to cardiovascular disease, fibromyalgia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder.The development of social phobia among adults has been shown to be associated with teasing or bullying during childhood.Recently published longitudinal studies have established that psychiatric symptoms and conditions can be antecedents and consequences of bullying.Furthermore, young males who have been frequent bullies and bully victims are at high risk for future criminality.www.virtualmentor.org",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT.According to statistics, about 90% of people were emotionally abused in childhood, but many do not realize, deny or, worse, their own children or others, considering that their treatment of childhood was natural and normal. Emotional is form of aggression, but law can not penalize it. Most parents believe that child means physical or violence and / or child neglect. But they do not know that they can hurt child simply by their excessive attitude. The emotional is any behavior that is intended to control, subjugate, submit other beings through fear, intimidation, humiliation, blaming, and growing guilt, coercion, manipulation, invalidation etc. The consequences of emotional are multiple, varied, extremely serious; they leave marks for life, affecting child development at various levels - emotionally, intellectually and even physically. Moreover, it will affect future adult's social and professional life, relationships and physical and mental health, to greater or lesser extent, depending on type of emotional abuse, and on its frequency and intensity.Keywords: behavior, emotional abuse, violence, control, abuse1. IntroductionAbuse means use of force in order to try to dominate child, to compel him/her to do dangerous things that he/she does not want to do, expose him/her to hazardous situations or to situations perceived by him/her as dangerous. Any action that causes injury or psycho-emotional disorders is an abuse.The can be of several types:Physical - involves use of physical force against children and subjecting them to hard work that exceed their capabilities, actions that result in damage of their body integrity.Emotional - is inappropriate behavior of adults towards children, behavior that adversely affects child's personality in development. Child rejection, forced isolation, terrorization, ignoration, humiliation and corruption are manifestations of child abuse.Sexual - consists in exposing child to watching pornography, seduction (advances, caresses and promises) or involvement in acts of any kind.Economic - implies attracting, persuading or forcing child to do income generating activities, adults close to child at least partially or indirectly benefiting from this revenue. The economic leads to removing child from school, thus depriving him of to access superior social and cultural levels.Neglection - is adult's inability or refusal to appropriately communicate with child, and limited access to education.The term sexual abuse refers to exploitation of child whose age does not allow him/her to understand nature of contact and to adequately resist it. This exploitation may be done by child's friend whom he/she is psychologically dependent on.The can have different aspects:- evocation (phones, exhibitionism, pornography, content of adult's language etc.)- stimulation (erotic contact, masturbation, incomplete genital contact, forced participation in sexuality of couple etc.)- making sex (rape or attempted rape).1.2 Issues of Abusea) Children may be abused since very young.Children may be abused from very early age. They are often seduced by games in sexual- abusive situation. The abuser often establishes positive relationships with both parents and child.The child is encouraged or forced to engage in abusive relationship. This is achieved through rewards and / or threats. The activity is presented as something special, and child should be considered lucky because he/she has a chance to participate in it. The child is unable to understand what is happening. Just when he/she is told that the game is secret he/she begins to understand that something is wrong. …",

      "abstract": "Violence may appear in a variety of contexts, such as private homes, public places, commercial spaces, colleges and universities, and other facilities1. It has a profound effect on people from all social classes. Because there was no standard term for violence, which made it a complicated and pervasive issue, it was not previously seen as a public health concern2. There is more to understanding violence than just tying it to empirical data. Instead, it entails making decisions about what constitutes proper and acceptable behaviour, which are influenced by societal norms, beliefs, and practices3. The deliberate use of force, real or threatened, towards themselves, another individual, an organisation or society, or oneself is what the World Health Organization, or WHO, defines as violence. This conduct has the risk of causing injury, death, psychological suffering, stunted growth, or impoverishment4. Although professional violence, including punching, kicking, shoving, hitting, shooting, and harming, has been acknowledged, until recently, little has been done to combat intellectual assault5. The intentional use of harm towards a person or group, including the threat or application of blunt force, is referred to as psychological abuse. The victim of this kind of assault may have detrimental effects on their psychological, ethical, moral, physical, and cognitive well-being6.",

      "abstract": "People with disabilities are “easy targets” because they often lack the acquired knowledge of appropriate or unacceptable behaviour, do not have sufficient acquired social skills, or sometimes believe that because of their disorders and dependence on others, they must be conciliatory and have no right to protest or rebel. Also, a physical or psychological deviation that sometimes suggests a person’s weakness in others can cause a sense of dominance and superiority, which in certain situations can turn into the intention of physical or emotional abuse. Unfortunately, statistics show that a greater number of people with disabilities have faced some types of violence to a greater or lesser extent, especially in the female population. Violence can have numerous and psychophysical severe consequences on people who are already struggling with health, functional and/or mental disorders and consequently have difficulties in realizing the required quality of life and human rights. For this reason, the task of the entire society should be aimed at preventing a spiral mechanism in which one fateful unfavourable situation, such as disability, triggers a series of others. Regardless of its potential, every being deserves care and protection, especially vulnerable groups whose suffering, pain or limitations are seen as their inevitable destiny. However, the strength, fighting spirit and dedication shown by people with disabilities are proof of their magnificence, which should not be rewarded with verbal or physical blows, but with tolerance, respect, and appreciation.",

      "title": "Differences in Criminal Behavior and Court Responses among Juvenile and Young Adult Defendants",
      "abstract": "The peak ages of criminality fall between the sixteenth and twentieth birthdays, with participation rates falling off rapidly for older age groups. Young men under the age of twenty-one account for half of all felony arrests. However, these arrest figures tend to overestimate the seriousness of the youthful offender crime problem somewhat because their crimes tend to be less serious and are committed in groups. There is a strong and direct connection between juvenile criminal activity and adult criminal careers. Chronic juvenile offenders have a high probability of continuing in crime as adults, while juveniles who were never arrested are unlikely to develop criminal careers as adults. Predictors of chronic juvenile offending include predelinquent deviant or troublesome behavior, physiological deficits associated with abnormal brain development, poor parenting, and evidence of criminal conduct or mental disorder among parents or siblings. In recent years juvenile and criminal courts have been criticized for failing to deal with young chronic offenders severely enough. The common belief was that the juvenile court was excessively lenient in all types of cases because of its concern for the welfare of the minor, while the criminal courts were probably forced to be lenient because they did not have unrestricted access to juvenile records. Analysis of case disposition patterns suggests that chronic juvenile and young adult offenders are sentenced to incarceration or state custody at least as frequently as is any other age group (for some types of crime) and that the seriousness of their juvenile records affects the severity of their sentences.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between individual personality traits and criminal behaviour is well established across various fields. Offenders are often more likely than others to engage in crime when exposed to problematic situations. However, differences in individual control within social contexts may explain varying levels of deviance. This theoretical review aims to identify key variables that lead to behavioural imbalance and deviant actions. Relevant literature on behavioural control and deviance was analysed. The findings indicate that five main variables influence deviant behaviour. First is the level of control, reflecting a person’s ability to anticipate correct behaviour and avoid deviance. Second is opportunity, linked to one's role, appearance, intelligence, and social connections. Third are restrictions and motives, where restrictions stem from social values and motives arise from family or societal persecution. Fourth is the causal sequence, meaning repeated psychological or social shocks that push individuals toward deviance. Fifth is self-control, shaped during childhood through experiences of discrimination or lack of safety. These factors are critical indicators that may predispose individuals to criminal activity. This study offers a theoretical base for future research and guidance for institutions aiming to develop behaviour-modifying social policies.",

Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

Some cultures implicitly support a man's right to have affairs, or even several wives, while others have a moral stance against infidelity. Severe marital strain may precipitate extra-marital liaisons or affairs. Frequent travel, overwork, sexual difficulty, or accumulating chronic anger all pose different risk factors from those stemming from individual developmental vulnerability. A man or woman using the internet for sexual interest may be spending time on internet sites and finding heterosexual or homosexual internet partners for emotional exchange and/or for internet sex. For one couple, having a normal but oedipally sexualised child will feel like an attack on the same-sex parent, while for another couple the developmental sexualisation of a teenager threatens. Long-standing sexual difficulty or inactivity pose risks. These surface factors then trigger unconscious issues.",

Recognition of elder abuse as a social problem and one type of family violence came after that of child and domestic abuse. Elder abuse was initially called “granny battering” and attracted the attention of medical personnel and later that of legal and academic personnel as well as the general public. Elder abuse continues to impact the lives of older adults, especially women, 60 years and older in several ways. It is a worldwide problem that impacts the quality of life of elders in several ways. Research and policy literature tend to classify elder abuse into seven main types: physical abuse, sexual abuse or abusive sexual contact, emotional or psychological abuse, neglect, self‐neglect, abandonment, and financial abuse or exploitation. Though several incidence and prevalence studies have been conducted, the need for more intervention studies is recognized.",

      "abstract": "The positive company image and its good reputation are usually results of ethical and honest behaviour towards employees and may cause competitiveness and benefits increase, customer satisfaction and new job places creating. However it occurs often in dynamically developing firms that ethical norms are not kept and this process is observed by lack of equal chances to get a job – people without connections remain without work. Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenceless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behaviour, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

      "title": "Paraphilia Induced Suicide: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Paraphilia is a term used to describe different sexual deviations involving unconventional methods of sexual gratification. Paraphili as indulged in abnormal and orthodox sex play by using objects as parts of the body or fantasies in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. Perversions are acts that are socially prohibited or unacceptable, or biologically undesirable. In sexual paraphilia, usually, person psychopaths suffer from mental aberrations and conflicts, socio-sexual maladjustments, psychosexual imbalance, and abnormalities. Paraphilia-induced suicide is a type of anomic suicide, and anomic suicide is due to a lack of social regulation that occurs during high levels of stress and frustration. Paraphilia may induce suicide even though paraphilia is not punishable. It is just due to fear of social defamation and social taboo. Case presentation: A 59-year-old male committed suicide on the railway track, and thenthe body was sent to the mortuary room for an autopsy examination. History was taken from the police and relatives. He was a widower for the last 15 years. Conclusions: Paraphilia is the form of the insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and when a person cannot remove foreign bodies himself, attending a hospital is very humiliating. To prevent the social integrity or selfesteem, the person committed suicide. Where this type of paraphilia is not listed as a crime in India, for sexual gratification, a person may use it by any means, which may be natural or unnatural form. Many unnatural forms of paraphilia are used by many people, which is not punishable. Sexual gratification is done by most of normal people and a few abnormal psychiatric people by any sexual perversion. All paraphilia that is not punishable by the law should not be considered a social taboo.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of great physiological and psychological change. Individuals have to progress from the dependence of childhood to the independence and maturity of the adult state whilst they are still regarded by many adults as predominantly children. Adolescents have to cope with the central problem of identity and of motivation and ambitions. They have to come to terms with the perceptions and judgements of other people on them and often experience stress in situations where they feel they are unable to reach the ideals of themselves or of others. Relationships with the opposite sex and acceptance by friends become crucial since they are the only means of judging one's self-value until the individual has achieved a reasonable degree of confidence and self-integration. This dependence on the opinions of others or on perhaps inappropriate ideals can lead to strong feelings of insecurity or inadequacy in adolescents. Adults obviously face similar problems but the myriad of physical and physiological changes which adolescents experience serve to heighten their emotional sensitivity. As a consequence of these adjustment problems, adolescence is often a period of unrest, of questioning and sometimes of outright rebellion and hostility.",

      "title": "Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Elder abuse is a global problem with an estimated 10% of older people experiencing some form of abuse although many cases remain unreported and/or not referred to social services. As such, the true extent of elder abuse is relatively unknown, and this poses significant challenges given recent demographic changes with people living longer. Maltreatment of older people, commonly referred to as elder abuse, is multidimensional and includes psychological, physical, sexual abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Elder abuse exists within a socio-ecological context with influences at the level of the individual, families, communities and society. The complex interplay between factors influencing elder abuse is challenging. Elder abuse may involve one or more types of abuse and may occur as a single or repeated act. A confounding problem is that those who carry out the abuse are often someone the older person knows well, such as partners, family members and friends. It may also be carried out by service providers who older people rely on in institutional and health care settings. In institutions or health care settings, elder abuse is most likely if staff lack education and training and/or there are inadequate resources to meet the care and support needs of older people. The outcomes from elder abuse are numerous and may result in poorer health, physical injuries, psychological morbidity and premature death. Due to the significant morbidity and premature mortality which may result from elder abuse, the physical, psychosocial and economic costs of elder abuse are considerable. Primary, secondly and tertiary interventions exist to address elder abuse. However, it is unclear what are the most effective interventions to prevent or reduce elder abuse across the diversity of settings. Given the wide range of possible elder abuse interventions and the lack of population knowledge about these, it is important to assess their possible benefits, effectiveness and any implications. The overall aim was to establish the effectiveness of primary, secondary and tertiary intervention programmes to prevent and/or reduce the occurrence of elder abuse in any setting (organizational, institutional and/or community settings). A further objective was to identify whether the interventions' effects were modified by types of abuse, types of participants, setting of intervention or cognitive status of older people (Baker, Francis, Hairi, Othman, & Choo, 2016). Participants in randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized trials, and quasi-RCTs, before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series were older people (age over 60) and those who care for them. Studies eligible for inclusion included methods of preventing or reducing re-occurrence of elder abuse and required to have a minimum of 12 weeks of follow up. Elder abuse interventions were classified as any strategies intended to avoid potential abuse or its re-occurrence in home, communities and institutions. Examples of these interventions included those designed to improve the quality of care and living situations of older people and those designed to improve long-term care. Interventions included those which sought to increase detection of abuse, raised awareness of elder abuse amongst the public and professionals, provided victim support and delivered training for care providers. The researchers also sought to determine whether programmes of a greater intensity were more effective. Seven studies, four from the United States, one from Taiwan and two from the United Kingdom (all classed as high income countries) were included. A total of 1942 older participants and 740 other people (e.g., family carers and staff) were involved. Three studies focussed on education and prevention interventions for health care professionals and caregivers. One study aimed to improve the mental health of carers in order to reduce abuse in persons with dementia, and one study focussed on the detection of abuse compared with a control arm focused on preventing elder abuse. One offered a psychosocial group intervention to support victims of abuse and one examined a multi-agency/public health approach. There was some evidence of increased knowledge and improved attitudes to elder abuse; however, results were mixed, whether these strategies were successful in detecting and preventing elder abuse. Overall, there was uncertainty as to the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse due to the heterogeneity in the settings, measures and effects reported in the seven included studies. The teaching of coping skills appeared helpful to reduce anxiety and depression of family member carers, although it was unknown whether this led to less abuse. Interventions targeting re-occurrence may possibly result in a detrimental effect. Of the four interventions deemed as higher intensity, only one low quality study showed some effect. Review authors were unable to draw any firm conclusions as to the effects of elder abuse interventions on any of the main outcomes compared with control/standard care. The seven studies were of low methodological quality with only one study judged to have no domains at low risk of bias. Although raising awareness of elder abuse, it is unclear if educational interventions can aid detection and prevent elder abuse. Blending education and support for victims may improve reporting but the evidence was equivocal. The reviewers identified some potential for service planning interventions to improve awareness of the need for meticulous assessment and documentation of elder abuse. Teaching coping skills to family members of the elderly with dementia is a promising approach. Programmes need to be carefully evaluated, as there is a risk for inadvertent harm. The present evidence does not support the approach of simply doing more of a program, or more in combination. More research is required as the current evidence base offers little guidance for nurses as to the best approaches to prevent and detect elder abuse. The review identified forthcoming research, but even so, given the breadth of the definition of elder-abuse and possible strategies, the evidence remains scarce. Elder abuse is a societal problem which can take various forms, may be carried out by those whom older people are reliant on and can be invisible. The findings of this review suggest that education interventions may improve attitudes to elder abuse but there is little evidence that such interventions have a positive impact on the prevention or reduction of elder abuse. A significant challenge for nurses is that elder abuse may be carried out by people well known to the older person or colleagues. Therefore, nurses need to be alert to the possibilities of elder abuse and have a duty of care to investigate if they have concerns. Nurses in the community or institutional care provide care for older people. They are therefore well placed to be alert to the possibility of elder abuse. Building a relationship with the older person and their family alongside impeccable assessment is important. Given education and training has been shown to change attitudes such training is important and staff need to be aware of policies around elder abuse. From an organizational perspective, the knowledge that the pressures of inadequate resources also positively correlate with an increase in elder abuse should be considered in the management of organizational risk. Given that family members often struggle with caring for elderly people with dementia, teaching coping skills appears a promising approach. Each situation should be evaluated to ensure that the actions are not resulting in detrimental effects. Furthermore, this review highlights the need to consider not only the responsibilities of individuals and organizations but also that of wider society in preventing and tackling the issue of elder abuse. In the absence of robust research evidence, it is recommended that primary, secondary and tertiary interventions continue to be funded, provided and engaged with in order that they may be fully evaluated.",

      "abstract": "The sexual abuse and exploitation of children is a serious problem. Adult sexual predators often use strategies known as grooming to entice their victims. These include targeting particularly vulnerable youth, gift giving, and systematically engaging in desensitizing sexual behaviors. Less commonly discussed is the notion of institutional grooming, the practice of strategically placing themselves in positions of public trust where they have access to children yet appear beyond reproach. Once situated, they can abuse children for decades without deterrence in spite of the fact that individuals around them may be aware–or partially aware–of their behavior. This article examines three cases, one involving a priest, another a football coach, and the third a pediatrician and considers the institutional practices and cultures that permit (or potentially permit) abuse and exploitation to flourish. Among other things it finds: confidentiality mandates and other codes of silence and secrecy impede information sharing; departmental or programmatic silos exist each with their own independent and competing agendas; confused reporting lines within the institution often end in the hands of powerful individuals who have an interest in non-disclosure; barriers exist to investing within the institution and reporting outside the institution often including mistrust and disempowerment of law enforcement and child protective services; extreme power differences exist between and among victims, predators, reporters, and other institutional players; and finally, intense loyalties personal, professional, and institutional are present. These factors produce institutional cultures that protect pedophiles and conspire against their vulnerable, individual, child victims.",

      "title": "Loneliness and abuse as risk factors for suicide in older adults: new developments and the contribution of the <scp>WPA</scp> Section on Old Age Psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Suicide is a major public health problem, with 817,000 cases worldwide in 2016. The incidence is highest in those aged 70 years or older, among both men and women, in almost all regions of the world1. Effective interventions that mitigate iden­tified risk factors and sustain protective fac­tors are relevant across all age groups, but re­search specifically focused on suicide pre­vention in older adults is still in its early stag­es. The evidence on the effectiveness of suicide prevention interventions for older adults remains limited. The International Association for Suicide Prevention Interest Group on Suicide in Old Age2 recommended multi-component approaches, based on the available scientific evidence, with an organized system of distribution of resources and the monitoring of the effectiveness of each intervention. Loneliness occurs when a person feels disconnected from his/her closest social circle: partners, family members, peers, friends and significant others. It often affects older adults, particularly men when single, widowed or divorced3. It may result from the loss of an important intimate relationship or a social role that previously used to give a person his/her sense of self-esteem and dignity. In case of negative life events or other psychological stressful situations, when the person has nobody to share his/her feelings with, loneliness can have particularly negative consequenc­es. This, in combination with other risk factors, can lead to an increase of the risk for suicidal behaviour. A particular expression of loneliness among older adults is the fact that suicides more often occur when the person is alone at home4. The consequences of the COVID-19 pan­demic have resulted in new challenges for older adults, and we are just beginning to see the effects on morbidity, mortality and suicide rates worldwide5. Many government policies to tackle the pandemic that include social isolation, lockdown and social distancing have resulted in increased distress in older adults. We therefore need to develop strong primary care and commu­nity assets to support older adults. A rise in suicide deaths in older adults as a result of the pandemic is not inevitable6. The traditional approaches to suicide prevention need to be re-considered7, so that we can develop innovative ways to address this issue in older adults in the new context. The voices of people with lived experience should be heard to inform developments in strategies. Previous traumatic experiences (e.g., history of abuse during childhood, loss of a parent) can have consequences in later life and be associated with increased likelihood of suicidal behaviour. But present traumatic experiences may also increase the risk for suicide. According to the World Health Organization, around 1 in 6 older people experienced some form of abuse in the past year8. However, the prevalence rates reported in existing population-based elder abuse studies likely underestimate the true population prevalence. Not only this field of research suffers from methodological and comparability challenges, but elder abuse prevalence surveys also carry substantial participation bias, in that they exclude individuals with cognitive impairment, who could potentially be most vulnerable to abuse, especially in institutions. Older adults with mental health problems are at high risk for abuse. There are many forms of elder abuse, including psychological, physical, sexual, financial and social abuse, as well as neglect and abandonment. Abuse should never be condoned, whatever the mitigating circumstances. What may not be considered abusive towards a healthy, competent person may be so in a vulnerable older adult. This is mainly explained by the high risk of older adults to be dependent (financially, emotionally, physically) from the persons who perpetrate acts of violence, abuse or neglect against them. Each form of elder abuse represents a risk factor for suicide. Several psychosocial risk factors found in severely abused older adults are also frequently present in older adults who attempted or completed suicide. Abused older adults have been paid inadequate attention in suicide prevention efforts. This omission must be remedied, as the aged global population will dramatically increase in coming decades, which, in the absence of meaningful preventive efforts, may drive a sharp rise in the incidence of older adults' abuse and suicide9. Help to establish strong social relationships and an effective legal frame to protect the individual against any form of violence are common protective factors against suicide. However, in the case of older adults, we should recognize that efforts to sustain these protective factors have been weaker than for the younger population. Considering the high potential of loneliness as a risk factor for suicide, the WPA Section on Old Age Psychiatry has supported the establishment of an End Loneliness Day. The Section is also going to become partner of the Campaign to End Loneliness. Having the friendship and support we need is a fundamental part of our well-being. When loneliness becomes entrenched in later life, it can be hardest to overcome. The campaign aims to involve academics, front-line practitioners, decision-makers and businesses (see https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org). Considering that all forms of elder a­buse are a violation of basic human rights, the WPA Section on Old Age Psychiatry is contributing to the effort to develop a new United Nations Convention on the Rights of Older Persons. A first action was a webinar organized in collaboration with the International Psychogeriatric Association on December 10, 2020, on the occasion of the Human Rights Day. The Section also organized an intersectional symposium on Threats to the Dignity of Older Adults with Mental Disorders during COVID-19 Pandemic within the 2020 WPA Thematic Meeting on Intersectional Collaboration. A Position Statement on Human Rights and Mental Health of Older Adults is now in preparation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Childhood experiences such as physical and sexual abuse and neglect are adverse events with immediate and long-term consequences. However, in considering child abuse and neglect as examples of adverse life events that have the potential to affect development and subsequent psychopathology, the assumption of “well-being” in the child’s life prior to the victimization experience may not be a reasonable one. Although certain forms of childhood victimization may indeed be viewed as acute stressors, child abuse and neglect often occur against a background of more chronic adversity in multiproblem homes. Child abuse or neglect may be only one of a family’s problems. Thus the general effects of other family characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment, parental alcoholism or drug problems, or other inadequate social and family functioning, must be recognized and disentangled from the specific effects of childhood abuse or neglect.",

      "abstract": "Chronic disease is not a strictly defined term and includes a large number of illnesses ranging from physical to mental impairment. It is estimated that between 10% and 20% of adolescents have a chronic disease. Independence and new relations, acceptance of a new body image and sexuality, career plans and cognitive maturation are core topics in development to adulthood. Chronic disease may interfere with these developmental tasks. Most often there is no specific psychopathology, but the type of impairment, its influence on family life and functioning, age at onset, gender, and other factors will interact with psychosocial maturation. Because of the important role of the family, not only the adolescent patient him/herself, but also parents and siblings need to be included in all major decisions. As hospitalizations may be disruptive they must be planned, taking in account the patient's plans and opinions. Chronic disease may lead to death during the period of adolescence. It is believed that the concept of one's own mortality develops at age 14 to 17 years, a fact that will influence care during the terminal stage of a disease. Whatever the problems and questions raised by the family, the developmental stage of the adolescent has always to be considered when dealing with specific issues of chronic disease. Periodic reassessment of psychosocial development is therefore one of the main tasks of the primary care physician. Counselling will address not only the disease but also the developmental tasks of any teenager.",

If a person is incapable of consenting because they are temporarily non-autonomous – as in the case of an intoxicated adult or a pre-autonomous child – the infringement should be delayed until the individual becomes autonomous and can make their own decision. Given the seriousness of violating anyone's right to BI, and especially that of the most vulnerable persons, the appropriate likelihood-of-consent for proceeding with a BI infringement on a child is argued to be at or near the 'medically necessary' threshold. Depending on what the proposed BI infringement is, then, children will sometimes be able to consent – or withhold their consent – to a proposed alteration of their bodies in a way that is appropriate for their developmental stage.",

Abuse of children is defined on different manners in literature but the author gives essential elements for legal determination of this concept. Act of violence exists when a parent, using a physical power on a position of supremacy tyrannies a child endangering its life, health, physical or emotional development. Physical abuse of a child can be determined from several aspects: medical, legal, social and cultural. The phenomenon of abuse was first observed by medical doctor and described as 'the battered child syndrome'. Although, it seams easy to define the physical abuse, there are many various definitions. In this paper, physical abuse of a child in the family means physical acting of the parents or guardians, by which on purpose, by the use of physical force, with or without the use of other means, are caused or could be caused physical injuries or death of a child. Emotional abuse is defined as parent's or guardian's acting or non acting, such as rejection, insult, isolation, terror, verbal attack etc. that might cause serious and permanent disorders in child's emotional development. Sexual abuse is defined as the use of a child to satisfy the sexual needs of one or more adult persons who have authority over a child and in whom the child trusts. The sexual abuse survivors have lifelong psychological problems.",

      "title": "Social trauma: The pathogenic effects of untoward social conditions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychoanalysis has traditionally overlooked the fact that unsuitable and damaging life conditions, originating in the social milieu, play a part in the pathogenesis of emotional suffering and mental disorders. Nonetheless, the self establishes an object relation with the social system, as well as with the non-human environment. This is expected to act as a container–contained relationship. Whenever the community and its institutions fail to act as a container for individuals and groups, this generates a trauma, which can be compared with the baby's experience of a failure in mothering. Such failures can be classified in several categories. The first is when the social system fails to contain, nurture, care for, and protect individuals, as in the case of the lack of assistance and compassion towards the victims of poverty, disease, natural catastrophe, social turmoil, economic crisis, violence, or war. The second category occurs when there is a blatant attack, on the part of the authorities or privileged social groups, on minorities, or even on the bulk of the population, as in the case of social repression, war—both internal and external—racism, genocide, or persecution. The third is when there is a perversion of the social system, which feigns to uphold current social values and laws while actually breaking them, as in the case of corruption, chicanery, and mendacity on the part of the authorities. One recent example of this is the impeachment process against the Chief of Government of Mexico City. The author approaches this problem by exploring the consequences of such experiences for the development and functioning of personality structure and personal relations, as well as their repercussions for individuals living together in the community and for the necessary relation between them and the authorities.",

Recent increases in reported cases of maltreatment have occurred disproportionately among older children and adolescents. However, adolescents are less likely to be reported to child protective services and are more likely to be perceived as responsible for their maltreatment. Adolescent girls are reported as victims more often than boys, especially in sexual abuse. However, boys may be less likely to be identified or reported and often are abused by nonfamily members. Parents of adolescent victims have higher average income and educational levels and are less likely to have a parental history of abuse than parents of younger children. A wide range of serious adolescent risk behaviors is associated with maltreatment. These include increased risk of premature sexual activity, unintended pregnancy, emotional disorders, suicide attempts, eating disorders, alcohol and other drug abuse, and delinquent behavior. Incarcerated youth, homeless or runaway youth, and youth who victimize siblings or assault parents have been shown to have high rates of prior maltreatment. Signs of maltreatment are often ambiguous for adolescents. Screening questions have been effective in prompting self-disclosure of abuse. Adolescents also experience problems in the child welfare system that offers fewer and less appropriate services for this age group. Recommendations are made regarding screening of adolescents for maltreatment, the development of better services for adolescents, research on parenting to prevent maltreatment, and training of school staff to identify and refer victims of maltreatment.",

      "abstract": "The emotional well-being of a child with a learning disability can alter when there is no emotional support available. This can lead one to become depressed and/or consider suicide. In North America, adolescent suicide has become a major public health problem. Currently, suicide is the third primary cause of adolescent death in both Canada and the United States. Suicide rates in the United States increased 142% between 1960 and 1981 for both boys and girls in the 15 to 19-year old age group. There are a number of factors that put a person's life in jeopardy, such as life events, trauma, and learning disabilities. Adolescents with learning disabilities are uncertain about their future and their personal goals. Depression may manifest when opportunities seem limited while trying to reach their personal and educational goals. They are often haunted by the stigma of having a learning disability. Youths are inclined to develop emotional difficulties and are likely to inflict self-harm. Emotional disorders are common among people with learning disabilities than those who are non-learning disabled. Individuals with learning disabilities are more likely to develop self- harming disorders as a result to being labeled with a learning disability. The definition of self-harm is defined as a non-accidental injury, which produces bleeding of momentary or permanent tissue damage over a repeated amount of time. Self-harming is found to be a physical and emotional outlet to relieve the stressors of school and home life. Another part of self-harm is head banging, cutting, biting, scratching, and hair pulling.",

      "title": "Adolescent School Failure: Failure to Thrive in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Success in school is an excellent marker for general adolescent well-being; school failure in adolescence is a powerful indicator of other high-risk behaviors, such as delinquency, substance abuse, and pregnancy. It is estimated that about 17% of White non-Hispanic children in the United States are at high or very high risk for these behaviors compared with 51% of African-American children and 45% of Hispanic children.It is difficult to consider any one of these high-risk behaviors in isolation because all can be antecedents to or consequences of any of the others. Lower grades, for example, are associated with substance abuse and early childbearing, and truancy and disruptive behavior at school are related to substance abuse and delinquency. Although there are many complex mitigating factors and pressures, most adolescents initially try hard drugs, commit a first delinquent act, or engage in unprotected intercourse as a personal decision at a given time and place.In contrast, school failure is more insidious, resulting from an array of forces, many of which are outside the control of the adolescent. It occurs at the end of a long process rather than at its initiation. Because school progress frequently is measured through grades and group achievement testing, there are many opportunities for preventive interventions. The ultimate marker of school failure is dropping out. In a sense, school failure and dropout can be viewed as failure to thrive of adolescence. Many of the etiologies for adolescent school failure can be viewed in both public health and medical model frameworks.Successful programs and interventions for adolescent high-risk behaviors largely address the antecedents to these behaviors rather than the behaviors themselves. The antecedents of school failure and subsequent dropping out, which are virtually the same, have been described by Dryfoos (see Suggested Reading) and are summarized in Table 1. Children who are 1 year older than classmates (behind 1 modal grade) have a 20% to 30% greater chance of dropping out of school, even when achievement, social status, and gender are controlled for. This should make clinicians skeptical of endorsing any recommendation for retention. Race and ethnicity cease to become factors in school dropout when social status is controlled for.In addition to the factors listed in Table 1, low self-concept and an external locus of control (believing that the\"winds of fate\" control one's destiny rather than the individual being able to bring about change) are significant predictors of school failure. Children and adolescents who have low self-esteem about their academic ability should be provided with individualized successful academic experiences. Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and \"behavior\"—referred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems—as major predictors of school failure. At the same time,\"psychological factors,\" including stress and depression, are characterized as predictors that only are \"cited in selected sources\" in the literature. This may be explained by reporting bias. Externalizing behavior problems (oppositional and defiant behavior and conduct problems) are easily recognizable in the classroom and affect the ability of teachers to teach and learners to learn as well as the\"social ecology\" of the entire classroom. Internalizing behaviors(anxiety and depression), on the other hand, are not easily identified by teachers and peers and do not often interfere with general classroom functioning. It is strongly incumbent on clinicians to ask about and identify any internalizing behavior problems in adolescents who are performing poorly in school because the health-care system may be the only professional interface outside of school used by adolescents and their families that is prepared to diagnose and treat these symptoms.The relationship between household composition and school failure is inconsistent. For example, it is unclear whether single-parent households are correlated with higher rates of school failure or dropping out.Children from disadvantaged homes have been found to succeed in excellent schools. On the other hand, some schools are so inadequate that success is the exception. In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if\"teachers paid more attention to students\" and if \"we were not treated like inmates.\"Effective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The \"best\" schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by\"ability\" has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as \"below average\" can have a tremendously negative effect on students' self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are \"scared straight\" or\"moralized to\" almost always fail. The question should be: \"How do schools fail adolescents?\" rather than \"How do adolescents fail school?\"Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can \"functional disorders\" such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on \"street value.\"Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and \"coaching\"surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent's problems being viewed as \"characterologic disorders\" rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual's achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as \"slow learners.\" They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including \"high-functioning autism,\"Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one's temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one's own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more \"medical model\"diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent's behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the \"patient\" where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD\"triad\") can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent's consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good \"learning hygiene\"; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

      "title": "Adolescent School Failure: Failure to Thrive in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Success in school is an excellent marker for general adolescent well-being; school failure in adolescence is a powerful indicator of other high-risk behaviors, such as delinquency, substance abuse, and pregnancy. It is estimated that about 17% of White non-Hispanic children in the United States are at high or very high risk for these behaviors compared with 51% of African-American children and 45% of Hispanic children.It is difficult to consider any one of these high-risk behaviors in isolation because all can be antecedents to or consequences of any of the others. Lower grades, for example, are associated with substance abuse and early childbearing, and truancy and disruptive behavior at school are related to substance abuse and delinquency. Although there are many complex mitigating factors and pressures, most adolescents initially try hard drugs, commit a first delinquent act, or engage in unprotected intercourse as a personal decision at a given time and place.In contrast, school failure is more insidious, resulting from an array of forces, many of which are outside the control of the adolescent. It occurs at the end of a long process rather than at its initiation. Because school progress frequently is measured through grades and group achievement testing, there are many opportunities for preventive interventions. The ultimate marker of school failure is dropping out. In a sense, school failure and dropout can be viewed as failure to thrive of adolescence. Many of the etiologies for adolescent school failure can be viewed in both public health and medical model frameworks.Successful programs and interventions for adolescent high-risk behaviors largely address the antecedents to these behaviors rather than the behaviors themselves. The antecedents of school failure and subsequent dropping out, which are virtually the same, have been described by Dryfoos (see Suggested Reading) and are summarized in Table 1. Children who are 1 year older than classmates (behind 1 modal grade) have a 20% to 30% greater chance of dropping out of school, even when achievement, social status, and gender are controlled for. This should make clinicians skeptical of endorsing any recommendation for retention. Race and ethnicity cease to become factors in school dropout when social status is controlled for.In addition to the factors listed in Table 1, low self-concept and an external locus of control (believing that the“winds of fate” control one’s destiny rather than the individual being able to bring about change) are significant predictors of school failure. Children and adolescents who have low self-esteem about their academic ability should be provided with individualized successful academic experiences. Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and “behavior”—referred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems—as major predictors of school failure.

These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including “high-functioning autism,”Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one’s temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one’s own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more “medical model”diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent’s behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the “patient” where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD“triad”) can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent’s consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good “learning hygiene”; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

Rape is a one of violence that is not distinguish with gender, age, socio-economic status, place and time.

Suffering includes social burdens in society, fears of pregnancy and the onset of illness or infection, and others. As a result of rape causes physical and psychological damage to rape victims. Psychological losses can affect the daily life of rape victims as a psychological impact. Psychological effects on rape victims appear with symptoms that appropriate to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including sadness, depressed mood, insomnia, loss of interest in usual activities, negative self-concept, self-blame, feeling useless and guilty, difficult to concentrate, often think about suicide or death. Compensation for rape victims needs to be obtained by considering the psychological condition. There has not yet been any compensation for the psychological impact on rape victims. About compensation has been regulated in Law No. 31/2014 Regarding Amendment to Law No. 13/2006 concerning Protection of Witnesses and Victims. the regulation does not include compensation for psychological effects. In this regard, it is necessary to address the urgency of regulating compensation for psychological effects on rape victims.",

Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenseless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration).

He probably makes large sacrifices to defray the cost of a ‘good education,’ and is liable finally to sacrifice his boy’s chances of happiness and success by an injudicious decision about his future. His difficulties may be increased, curiously enough, by his failure to realise that conditions of entry into a career are radically different from what they were thirty or forty years ago. He perhaps is still sufficiently romantic to talk about, and even to believe in, the ‘self-made man’ ideal, although the impracticability of it in these days of combines and over-population is surely manifest. Or he is likely to adopt one of two favourite attitudes; either, that his personal experience of the exigencies of his own calling determines him not to allow his son to follow it, or that the only reasonable thing for a son to do is to step into his father’s shoes and continue the work built up for him. If he is neither romantic nor obstinate, he will consult his son’s inclinations and, in all probability, he will find them either fantastic or completely unformed. A normal boy rarely shows a marked aptitude for one particular business or profession in his early or middle school-days, and if he forms an opinion about his future it is usually much influenced by a limited knowledge of his father’s occupation.",

The assumption that because of their disability some people simply do not have the cognitive abilities to exercise choice and control over their lives, and as a result must be restricted in the name of protection, is at the root of the ableism that pervasively shapes their lives.

Different deviant conditions may evoke different kinds of responses. For example, individuals who display selfish behavior such as hurting others, stealing property, or lack of motivation to cooperate, tend to be punished; others who are incapable of cooperating and contributing to group life due to illness or injury, usually receive care and medical treatment; and still others with abnormal facial features, may primarily evoke fear and avoidance rather than punishment or care and protection. Furthermore, the same deviant condition may also trigger widely different responses in different situations, historical periods, and cultures, ranging from extreme moral outrage and harsh physical punishment to “softer” treatment and forgiveness, and from extreme tenderness and care to “less soft” and more aggressive and authoritative forms of nurturance and therapy. Pretending not to be affected by a particular deviant condition, and the suppression and indirect expression of one's emotional reactions to the condition, or the consistent avoidance of a deviant individual in order to prevent experiencing these emotions, may be considered as further variants of how individuals respond to deviance.",

      "title": "Discrimination and stigma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Discrimination and stigma operate as two distinct but concomitant phenomena and, as a result, affect attitudes, behaviours, and policies against underprivileged populations and often those with mental illnesses. Stigma has been defined as the ‘social devaluation’ of an individual or group. This is based on certain characteristics that such an individual or group is identified with and is an outcome of cognitive processes and negative attitudes that lead to rejecting behaviours at physical, social, or psychological levels. Stigma arises from the implicit belief and bias (conscious or unconscious) that individuals with certain undesired characteristics are inferior and therefore unworthy of equal treatment, respect, and dignity. Discrimination entails a range of behaviours, practices, laws, or policies that result in the marginalization of certain individuals or groups in society. It may manifest as unequal treatment, human rights violations, and social exclusion. Discrimination often can be tackled in law; therefore, it is important to understand the role of laws and policies in addressing discrimination. Persons with psychosocial disability are often discriminated against, do not have equal rights, and, in many countries, cannot marry, vote, make a will, or have employment rights. Preventing discrimination requires a range of anti-discrimination laws, policies, and decisions that address specific disadvantages and harms caused to such individuals. This needs a fundamental transformation of existing social structures and the removal of barriers to ensure that people with mental illnesses and consequent psychosocial disabilities have equal rights.",

Adolescence is a time of important biological, physiological, neurological, behavioural and social transitions towards adulthood.

Not surprisingly, the psychological stressors of going through adolescence, coupled with major hormonal, physiological and identity development and peer pressure (to fit in with dominant peer norms), result in enormous stress levels that sometimes lead to a variety of mental health disorders, e.g. inadequate coping and/or support structures.",

      "title": "Sexual abuse of children in Senegal",
      "abstract": "In Senegal, sexual abuse of children has become less of a taboo subject and is increasingly publicized. Past sexual abuse is often discovered in adolescents and adults consulting for mood or sexual identity disorders and addictive behaviors. These patients did not receive any psychological treatment because their parents quickly “forgot” the event. Thus, recovery is impossible: judicial redress has not been started and there is no family recognition of the harm and trauma. The reactions of parents can promote or block the “healing” process, and unsupported children can feel resentment towards their parents. The request for clarification is left hanging and will influence the psychological makeup of the future adult and the quality of their relationship with their parents. Parental silence is generally underpinned by sociocultural considerations, such as the judgment of others, resignation, or divine will.",

      "abstract": "The criminal behaviour is most often advocated as result of cirtain social, psychological atrocities. Present study aimed to know socio demographic variables, which are responsible for criminal behavior because criminals are not born they are made, and if we as a society can make them then we as a society also have the power to cure them. AJuvenile Delinquent, a person who is under age (below 18), who is found to have committed a crime in states which have declared by law that a minor lacks responsibility and thus may not be sentenced as an adult. The sample of the present study form 50 male delinquents children from “Bal-Sampreshan Grah”, Manacamp, Raipur (C.G.) were purposively selected for the study. These juvenile delinquents sometimes have mental disorders/behavioural issues such as post traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder, and are sometimes diagnosed with conduct disorder partially as a result of their delinquent behaviours. Many factors like schools, neighbourhood, Family, Society, Situations are equally responsible for the degradation or fall of a child. Hence, instead of labelling them as one we must try and find ways, rectify the errors in their lives which led them to behave in this manner. Children can be easily rehabilitated and psychological rehabilitation can be helpful to take them back in society.",

      "title": "Developmental trajectory of substance use disorders: what role do the parents play (or are perceived to play)?",
      "abstract": "The aetiology of substance use disorders is considered to be multi-factorial as the individual, developmental and contextual dimensions interact together. From the developmental perspective, research has identified several aspects of family environment that are consistently associated with substance use disorders. Parent child interaction and parenting style are the primary focus of research. A conflict ridden and highly authoritarian parent child interaction predicts substance use in the future1. On the other hand, parenting style can both be a risk or a protective factor depending on its characteristics. Parental warmth as well as limit setting could be protective for future substance use2.\r\n\r\nParenting style is not a unitary concept. It is largely dependent on direct factors like parental personality, psychopathology, and substance use and on the indirect effects of other contextual factors like low socio-economic status (LSES), minority status, immediate environmental adversities and children's maladaptive behaviour3. Parental substance use has been consistently linked to substance use in the offspring4,5. Addicted mother's parenting has been characterized by a wide range of deficits starting from neglect, physical or emotional abuse, punishments to excessive control, lack of emotional involvement and inconsistent discipline2. In addition, parental psychopathology like depression, anxiety or antisocial personality and poor coping with stress has been demonstrated to be related with substance use disorders in their children4,6. But this indictment of the parents needs to be seen in the light of the various contextual factors2. This proposition could be more appealing in the traditional societies where there is interdependence and family is the most important institution that has survived through the ages. These traditional societies are collectivist (with a sense of harmony, interdependence and concern for others, and where collective values of the family take precedence over individual values in case of a conflict) that emphasizes family integrity, family loyalty, and family unity7.\r\n\r\nIn the article by Pettenon & colleagues published in this issue8, the perception of parental bonding has been compared between crack cocaine users and non-illicit drug users. The authors examined hospitalized cocaine dependent subjects and non-illicit drug users as control subjects, both from the same geographical area with matched demographic characteristics. Parental bonding instrument (PBI)9 was used to assess various parenting style in both the parents. PBI measures two constructs: care and control. With various permutation and combinations of these constructs, four different styles of parenting are possible: optimal parenting (high care, low control), affectionate control (high care, high control), affectionless control (low care, high control) and neglectful parenting (low care, low control)9. Results of this study demonstrated that crack cocaine users were more likely to perceive their mothers as neglectful and their fathers as carelessly controlling. On the other hand, non-illicit drug users were perceived to have optimal parenting. This study has highlighted the importance of parenting style in the developmental trajectory both as risk factors (for cocaine users) and perhaps as protective factors (for the control subjects) for development of later substance dependence.\r\n\r\nThe study was cross-sectional and conducted on an exclusively male clinical sample selected by non-random purposive method. As already acknowledged by the authors, these factors have curbed the generalizability of the study and its strength to establish causality8. But, by choosing clinical population the authors perhaps were able to tap the most severe end of the spectrum of substance use disorder which could be assumed to be homogeneous. They had a reasonably large sample size seemingly adequate for the purpose of the study. To eliminate the effects of the contextual factors like LSES, ethnic minority or adverse residential environment, the study subjects and the controls were matched as per their socio-demography. Hence, the result of ‘disordered’ parental bonding in the cocaine dependent subjects was unlikely to be due to other contextual variables. Additionally, exclusion of these contextual factors has made the association of impaired parental bonding with substance dependence more specific. Nevertheless, there are a few caveats in the study. As the authors have only studied subjects with substance use disorder, there is always a possibility of subjective bias coloured by subjects’ personality and personal experience. Concurrent interview of the parents could have eliminated this possibility. The subjects with cocaine dependence had significantly higher psychiatric co-morbidity than the controls. As it has been amply researched that psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are linked to childhood adversities and impaired parenting, presence of these co-morbidities perhaps confounded the association of parenting style and cocaine dependence10,11. However, epidemiological studies have shown that almost half of those having substance use disorders have a mental illness in their lifetime. The risk of developing a mental illness is 2-4 times more common in subjects with substance dependence than the controls12,13. Hence, it would practically be impossible to find out a substance use disorder group which does not differ significantly from controls with regard to the presence of psychiatric co-morbidity.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there is a philosophical controversy in any research directed to the area of parenting style and future psychopathology. The controversy pivots around causality. One is reminded of Freida Fromm-Reichmann's theory of ‘schizophrenogenic mother’, which stated that schizophrenia is ‘caused’ due to unconscious rejection by the mother of the child (who later grows up to develop schizophrenia)14. A commentator has recently observed on its current status: “Today, in light of what we now understand about schizophrenia, the theory of the schizophrenogenic mother seems hopelessly mistaken, and more than a little embarrassing”15. Likewise, one has to be careful in the interpretation of this study findings, lest ‘affectionless’, ‘controlling’ and ‘neglecting’ parents are easily labelled as ‘addictogenic’. This could have the appalling potential to inflict pain and burden to the parents who were and would be the primary caregiver for their kids. ‘Blaming’ the parenting style and family interaction for addiction in other family members could, therefore, be a double edged sword and might well be detrimental.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, important to remember that the parenting styles reported in this study8 are ‘perceived’ parenting styles rather than actually observed parenting styles. Such perceptions can be distorted through the looking glass of chronic addiction. It is extremely difficult to conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to settle this issue. In an exceptional 30-year prospective study published very recently, unsupportive maternal behaviour, actually observed and rated by a developmental psychologist at eight months of age of the infant, predicted mental health problems in the grown up adults 30 years later16. Such studies are rare to come by. ‘Perceived’ parenting styles in a retrospective recall design cannot, and should not, implicate causality of addiction as ‘addictogenic’ parents. The value of the current study8, therefore, does not lie in inference of causality of any sort, but in the very fact that these ‘perceived’ parenting styles can have important bearing on the course and outcome of the subjects’ substance use trajectory. These need to be considered in the therapy of these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe present study by Pettenon & colleagues8 is from Brazil, which is one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries which are developing or newly industrialised countries, distinguished by their large, fast-growing economies. All these countries have their commonalities in the primacy of family or collectivistic society over the individualistic society. Hence, the results of this study could be equally relevant and meaningful for Indian context.",

      "title": "The development of aggressive behaviour during childhood: What have we learned in the past century?",
      "abstract": "Research on human aggression has been a flourishing industry in the 20th century. As the attention shifted from an instinctual paradigm to a drive paradigm and a social learning paradigm, what have we learned on the development of aggressive behaviour during childhood? Are children born with an aggressive instinct or do they have to learn to aggress?This question has deep philosophical roots, but it also has important practical implications. Should interventions prevent children from learning to aggress or should they help children learn to inhibit aggressive reactions? Since most of the 20th century work on the development of aggression was concentrated on adolescents and elementary school age children, there appeared to be an implicit assumption that aggression is learned during these developmental periods. It is argued that to understand the origins of aggressive behaviour and prevent chronic cases of physical aggression we will need to focus on the development of aggressive behaviour during the first few years after birth, and differentiate among forms of aggressive behaviour. The form of agressive behaviour that is generally considered more “serious” or “socially unacceptable” (physical aggression) is clearly ontogenetically antecedent to less “serious” forms of aggressive behaviour, such as verbal aggression or indirect aggression. Furthermore, as a rule the frequency of physical aggression appears to decrease with age. However, infants’ physical aggression has generally not been considered developmentally significant. This is probably because of “the weakness of their limbs” and the apparent lack of “intentionality”. To have a relatively complete description of the life-span developmental trajectories of human aggressive behaviour by the end of the 21st century, we will need to start recruiting pregnant women very soon.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder is a medical condition marked by a diminished capacity to halt or manage alcohol consumption, even in the face of detrimental social, professional, or health outcomes. It encompasses various terms such as alcohol abuse, dependence, addiction, and colloquially, alcoholism. Research has consistently highlighted the significant toll that alcoholism can take on the spouses of individuals struggling with alcohol addiction. Living with a spouse who struggles with alcoholism can be incredibly challenging and emotionally taxing. It can have significant impacts on one's mental and physical health, as well as on the dynamics of the relationship and family life. The typologies of wives of alcoholics categorize the various coping and behavioral patterns these individuals may adopt in response to their spouse's alcoholism, including enabling the behavior, adopting a victim mindset, compensating by being overly competent (the hero), displaying oppositional behavior (the rebel), or withdrawing emotionally and socially to protect themselves. The dynamics of alcoholism in a marriage can erode trust, communication, and intimacy, often leading to a breakdown of the relationship if left unaddressed. Seeking professional help, such as therapy or support groups, can be crucial for both spouses to navigate the challenges of alcoholism and work towards healing and recovery, either individually or as a couple.",

      "title": "The Spiel of Male Victims Later Being the Abusers",
      "abstract": "Children who are subjected to sexual abuse often endure deep, long-term psychological trauma. Many of them struggle with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sexual dysfunction, and self-harming tendencies. Research shows that children who experience such abuse are significantly more vulnerable to being revictimized sometimes not just once, but repeatedly throughout adolescence and even adulthood. Alarmingly, studies indicate they are up to 35 times more likely to be abused again than those who have not faced childhood sexual trauma. This increased susceptibility is often rooted in feelings of self-blame, worthlessness, and shame.This issue becomes even more disturbing when we look at children who live on the margins of society those without shelter, family care, or institutional protection. Children on the streets, in slums, or those forced into child labor such as rag-picking or begging are especially exposed. With no stable home, adult supervision, or legal protection, these children are not only easier targets for sexual predators, but they also lack the means to report abuse or even understand what is happening to them. For many of them, trauma becomes a silent companion unspoken, untreated, and slowly destructive.",

Social status is related to two different characteristics: prosocial behaviors and the ability to successfully achieve social goals. It is not necessary to have both characteristics to achieve popularity. Some see the bullies' goal-achieving aggression as effective and even admirable, while others may view the very same behaviors as cruel and self-centered.

It is also pointed that hypoactive sexual desire can be caused by: long-term sexual abstinence; response to a sexual disorder of one’s male/female spouse (male/female partner); psychological response to another sexual dysfunction in the other person. Besides, weak sexual desire can be revealed in homosexual men and women, who have not accepted their sexual orientation to the end. The article gives data about influence of cultural/religious factors on the frequency of sexual desire. For example, noticeable differences exist in the levels of incidence of low desire in different cultures: from 12.5% in men from Northern Europe to 28% in men from South-East Asia at the age of 40-80. The association between the East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men can be mediated by feeling of guilt. Lower values of sexual desire were detected in women from East Asia versus women of the Canadian origin.",

      "abstract": "Humans are motivated to connect with others and are sensitive to social exclusion—intentionally leaving out others. This ability to detect social exclusion is suggested to be evolutionarily adaptive, biologically hardwired, and an important feature of social-cognitive development. Yet it is unclear when children start to independently detect social exclusion. Previous developmental research on social exclusion has focused on children older than 4 years of age, but recent infancy research has suggested younger children may be able to process complex social interactions such as social exclusion. The present study is the first to examine whether 2- to 3-year-old children detect social exclusion and if they prefer to affiliate with individuals who have been excluded over individuals who exclude others. Across 2 experiments, 2- and 3-year-old children (N = 140) viewed exclusive group interactions, in which 2 agents unjustly excluded 1 agent, and children were asked to choose whether they preferred to play with an excluded agent or an exclusive agent. Three-year-old children consistently preferred to play with the excluded agent, whereas 2-year-old children showed no preference. Three-year-old children did not show a preference among agents engaged in inclusive interactions and did not prefer an agent who refused to engage with a group, showing that 3-year-old children distinguish unjust exclusion from other types of interactions. Together, these findings suggest 3-year-old children detect social exclusion and are motivated to affiliate with unjustly excluded agents over those who exclude others, whereas these capacities are still developing in 2-year-old children.",

During adulthood, juniors show no deficits in defense of territory, annual survival, cellular immunity, age and date of first breeding, or the number of fledglings produced through age 16 years. Similarly, although one-third of junior human siblings suffer physical, psychological, or relational aggression from siblings on a weekly basis, affecting self-esteem, loneliness, anxiety, interpersonal stress, and depression, rigorous studies found no effects on the major personality traits in adulthood: emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and imagination.

      "title": "Childhood Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Sexual abuse is defined as use of child or adolescent by the adults for satisfying of sexual urges and needs with forcing, threatening or tricking. Sexual abuse can be in the form of sexual abuse without touch, sexual touch, interfemoral intercourse, sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. The prevalence of sexual abuse is reported as 10-40%. It is seen in female four times more than in males. Abusers are frequently male, only 5-15% of them are female. The abuse by females is usually towards male child. Thirty-fifty percent of abuse cases among child and adolescent are outside the family including strangers or familiar person. Some features of abusers are introvert personality, pedophilic and antisocial personality. Most of the abusers have a history of sexual abuse or aggression during childhood. Sexual intercourse between two people who are not allowed to marry by law is called as incest. Family pattern of incest is defined globally as disorganized and dysfunctional. The most commonly reported familial pattern is rigid and patriarchal family pattern with a harsh father using force quite frequently. The clinical features and impacts of the sexual abuse on the child varies according to the relation between abusers and the child, form of abuse, duration of abuse, presence of physical assault, developmental phase, child age and psychological development before the abuse. Sexual abuse history may result in psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, substance dependence, suicide act, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse negatively affects interpersonal relationships and self esteem of abused individuals. Several studies reported close association between risky sexual behaviors in adulthood and a history of of sexual abuse during childhood. Four traumatic dynamics including traumatic sexuality with abuse, feeling of betrayal, weakness, and stigmatization exist in childhood abuse. Trauma can cause behavioral and psychological results by itself, early trauma may also lead to biological effects. Especially traumas during neuron plasticity phase may lead hypersensitivity of neuroendocrine stress response. Early life stresses are shown to lead changes in corticotrophin releasing factor system in preclinical and clinical phase studies. In the treatment of sexual abuse, emotional process related with trauma should be focused on. This process may be conducted with play therapy. Development of higher level defense mechanism, increasing ego capacity, orientation to social activity and personal activity according to skills is aimed. For the elimination of guiltiness related with stigmatization, the child should be told that it is not herhis fault to incorporate into sexual interaction and the culprit is abuser. It is fairly important for medical staff, school and family to have sufficient information about sexual abuse for prevention and early recognition.",

The rampant rape of minors, as happened in various regions in Indonesia, where the perpetrators were their own fathers to an ustadz who raped dozens of his students, children are the future of the nation who have the right to live and develop, so these rights must be protected, and there is no implementation Appropriate law against the perpetrators is the main focus where the application of sanctions is currently only limited to imprisonment for 5-15 years or life imprisonment even though there are opportunities for more severe punishments such as chemical castration and the death penalty. In the event that the crime of rape of a minor causes more than 1 person to be victimized, results in serious injury, mental disorder, infectious disease, disruption or loss of reproductive function, or the victim dies, the perpetrator shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment or imprisonment for a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of 20 years.",

During puberty, which starts the process of adolescence, adolescents are faced with the fact they have not chosen their body which sends them back to the experience of passivity of childhood. It arouses in the most vulnerable adolescents what remains of expectations or affective dependence regarding their family circle, and thus they are confronted with that basic human paradox, i.e. to be oneself one has to accept to receive and to feed upon others and at the same time to be different from them. Such a fear of being dependent on others may lead adolescents to deprive themselves of what they expect to receive from others. Sexuality and the body, through the emotions they summon, are particularly subject to aggressive or rejection behaviours which characterize that age.",

In dealing with the nature and relationship between the two concepts, another notion of morality also comes into a comparative context. Morality, if often interchangeably used with the ethics, could be seen in some differences that ethics is a dimension one step removed from action. So we used to preach our dependents or subjects to conform their conduct to the kind of moral demand, \"Exert your best to the interest of nations or society,\" \"Practice a love and humiliation with brothers, sisters and neighbors,\" \"Never be drunken while driving,\" \"Do not commit an adultery or do not steal otherâ€™s property,\" and the likes. Law, then, would be a minimal of morality which prescribes a prohibited conduct and corresponding criminal sanctions proportionally with the gravity of culpability or social harms.

Exclusion may be based upon racial, ethnic, linguistic, caste, religious, and other cultural identities as well as upon age, gender, sexuality, disability, poverty, unemployment, socioeconomic conditions, and place of residence dimensions that tend to overlap, intersect, and accumulate over time. Social exclusion has interrelated negative consequences for both the excluded individuals and society as a whole. As a social relationship, exclusion may be deliberate or institutional, face to face or impersonal. Regardless, it involuntarily restricts one's fulfillment of normatively prescribed social roles. Social inclusion does not necessarily remedy social exclusion. Both terms are used in sociological and policy discourse.",

The possibility of false allegation needs to be considered, particularly if allegations are coming from the parent rather than a child, if parents are engaged in dispute over custody or visitation, and/or if the child is a preschooler. False allegations may arise in other situations as well, such as the misinterpretation of a child's statement or behavior by relative or caretakers. And children may make false statement in psychiatric evaluations. A case of false allegation of sexual abuse made by mentally retarded 10 year-old girl who has been located in an institute is presented. During her evaluation process, it was clinician's diagnostic impression that she had no been sexually abused but sexually stimulated in some way, and most of what she said was a fantasy lie. Its pathological mechanism is discussed in terms of pseudologia fantastica along with the review of literatures.",

      "abstract": "Environments erode health by shaping biologically based goal systems, or adaptive strivings, that help a brain regulate bodily energy resources. Adaptive strivings let predictive brain processes anticipate and meet even modest shifts in impending metabolic demands. Adaptive strivings serve growth, social potency, and safety. Striving for personal and social growth (transcendence striving) improves energy regulation and promotes health. But adverse environments can foster precarious strivings that cause organic damage even in the absence of fight-flight responses or distressing emotions: Agonistic striving (persistently seeking to influence others) and dissipated striving (disengaging to be safe) impair regulation and foster illness by generating perpetual power contests or perceptions of self-inefficacy. Threats to social power or status endanger health by inducing precarious strivings that amplify adversities. Emotional transcendence striving, however, may dampen harsh health impacts. Research has replicated the three strivings across differences of race, sex, and age and indicates that agonistic striving contributes to hypertension, somatic symptoms, and alcohol use disorders. Harmful health effects of agonistic striving are moderated by emotional transcendence striving indexed by the ability to modulate anger or physical pain. Agonistic striving mediates the association between exposure to neighborhood disorder and hypertension after controlling for negative emotions and disease-prone traits.",

It has done some loose living on the tongues of many people; it has kept questionable company with other bad words like 'pauperization' and 'welfare state'; it has been under attack by a group of highly respectable myths; and it has a way of making some people angry and other people uneasy. Economic dependency may be said to be a condition of having to rely upon some source of income which the individual does not earn by his labours or endeavours. The signs by which one can detect psychological dependency are not that the individual gets aid to dependent children, old age assistance, or general assistance. They are, rather, the presence of feelings of resignation, helplessness, hostile pessimism, physical sickness for which doctors can find no organic base, passivity, and inability to mobilize the self to take necessary action or responsibilities.",

      "title": "The Important Role of Adolescent Health in Gender Equality and Social and Economic Development",
      "abstract": "The present paper deals with adolescent and its impact on socio-economic development of India along with the issues in gender equality.Adolescent, or the second decade of life, is a period in which an individual undergoes major physical and psychological changes.Alongside this, there are enormous changes in social interactions and relationships. It is a phase in an individual's life rather than a fixed time period; a phase in which an individual is no longer a child but is not yet an adult. Adolescence is a time of opportunity, but also one of risk. It presents a window of opportunity because actions could be taken during this period to set the stage for healthy adulthood and to reduce the likelihood of problems in the years that lie ahead. At the same time, it is a period of risk; a period when health problems that have serious immediate consequences can and do occur such as deaths resulting from road traffic injuries, and sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies resulting from unprotected sexual activity; a period when problem behaviours which could have serious adverse effects on health in the future such as tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption are initiated. Worldwide more than 1.2 billion are adolescents: this indicates that roughly one in every six persons is an adolescent. About 21% of Indian population is adolescents (about 243 million). They are the future of the nation, forming major socio-economic and demographic forces of the society. They have specific needs which vary to gender, life circumstances and socio economic conditions. They face challenges like poverty, lack of access to health care services, unsafe environments etc. It is a period of preparation for undertaking greater responsibilities like familial, social, cultural and economic issues in adulthood. The health status of an adolescent determines the health status in his/her adulthood. Many serious diseases in adulthood have their roots in adolescence. Also, many adolescents do die prematurely due to various reasons that are either preventable or treatable and many more suffer from chronic ill-health and disability. We can categorize the health needs of the adolescents broadly into three categories-physical, psychological and social. Methodology: focus group discussion with adolescent population, interview with key population like health workers, officials and community leaders, literature review, used of published and unpublished materials related to the present issues etc.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as “all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, development or dignity.” There are four main types of abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological abuse and sexual abuse. Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

      "abstract": "Moral conduct is motivated and regulated mainly by the ongoing exercise of self‐reactive influence. But self‐regulatory mechanisms do not operate unless they are activated, and there are different psychological mechanisms by which moral control can be selectively activated or disengaged from inhumane conduct. Self‐sanctions can be disengaged by reconstruing detrimental conduct through moral justification, euphemistic labeling, and advantageous contrast with other inhumanities; by obscuring personal agency in detrimental activities through diffusion and displacement of responsibility; by disregarding or misrepresenting the harmful consequences of inhumane conduct; and by blaming and dehumanizing the victims. These mechanisms of moral disengagement operate not only in the perpetration of inhumanities under extraordinary circumstances, but in everyday situations where people routinely perform activities that bring personal benefits at injurious costs to others. Given the many psychological devices for disengagement of moral control, societies cannot rely solely on individuals, however honorable their standards, to provide safeguards against inhumanities. To function humanely, societies must establish effective social safeguards against moral disengagement practices that foster exploitive and destructive conduct.",

      "abstract": "Many adolescent difficulties relate to the problem of not being able to tolerate the 'gap' between self and other, upon which subjectivity is founded. We have seen in Chapter 6 that one particular aspect of expressing difficulty with and defending against the pains of separateness and intimacy is to engage in behaviours and take up positions that appear more adult or at least show intolerance of the pains of dependency. On the other hand, it is possible to identify adolescents that appear to locate the problematic arena in the outside world of peers and adulthood. These adolescents appear to be stuck on the inside, within the child in the family role. This has the meaning that the impact of internal, familial and social factors, often in inextricable combinations, slows down or brings to a halt the adolescent development towards separateness and relative independence of parental figures. Thus, either physically or emotionally or both the adolescent is unable to become a 'temporary outsider'. There is a range of adolescent difficulties that can be associated with being stuck on the inside. In order to explore the psychosocial aspects of these difficulties in adolescence, this chapter will discuss adolescents with phobias, body image disturbance and eating disorders and disabilities. This is followed by a discussion of depression and self-harm.",

      "abstract": "Child abuse is present in all societies. Abuse is a form of negative behavior characterized by longer duration, multiple repetitions and presence of imbalance of power. Abuse is directed at the same person, it is intentional and conscious behavior.\r\nThree main types of abuse are: physical abuse, emotional abuse and sexual abuse. As forms of violations of children's rights and inadequacy of their needs, which can have the same effects on the child as well as abuse, is neglect. Child abuse can be identified by different signs.\r\nPsysical abuse has clear consequences and if we observe child psysical abuse should be the easiest to identify. Psysical abuse includes hitting, pushing, causing pain, physical restraint, shaking, tightening, biting, scalding, etc. Emotional abuse dentified according to changes in the behavior of the child. Indicators of emotional abuse can be the child's fearfulness, tics, stuttering, insecurity, etc... Sexual abuse includes kissing, touching genitals or breasts, sexual intercourse, oral and anal contact, viewing and showing pornographic magazines and films or other pornographic material. Sexual abuse, same as an emotional abuse, dentified according to changes in the behavior of the child (anxiety, depression, fear of physical contact, etc.) and to injuries in the area of sexual organs.\r\nIt is very important as soon discover that a child is a victim of abuse, and protect it from further exposure to violence, and to report it to the social welfare center. Kindergarten teacher have a very important role in the detection and prevention of violence because she spend a lot of time with children and she (or he), with children, builds trusting relationship.\r\nThe empirical part was about recognized sings of abuse. The kindergarten teachers are very important in a child's life and they need to be sensitive and skilled in tracking and identifying the different signs of violence.",

Involving the patient's sexual partner in treatment is imperative if marital difficulty is part of the presentation, or if the spouse has rejected the sexual behavior. This chapter addresses patients with primarily aggressive disorders sometimes manifested in sexual terms to some extent. Their conditions are more properly seen as disorders of impulse control, antisocial behavior, and the like. The treatment of fetishism rarely involves concerns about criminality or danger to others. Presenting complaints generally focus on guilt or difficulty with one's sexual partner. The general understanding and treatment of Frotteurism is often seen as similar to those of Exhibitionism and Voyeurism. Biological treatments are often recommended for Pedophilia, particularly aggressive forms, as well as other disorders in which sexual and aggressive drives combine to give rise to socially intractable behavior.",

      "abstract": "Social exclusion, or ostracism, is being excluded or rejected by others. It is the common behaviour within social situations. Detecting social exclusion could be essential for the survival of human creatures, as social exclusion could threaten the basic needs of human creatures: self-esteem and feelings of belongingness. Williams temporal need threat model introduces how individuals react toward ostracism. Usually, individuals can recover from social exclusion quickly by behaving pro-socially to reconnect to others and fortify the basic need(s) threatened by social exclusion. However, for individuals with higher social anxiety or social anxiety disorder, the negative social belief about themselves (unpopular, shyness) within a social situation inhibits their recovery speed from exclusion and desire to reconnect to others. When social exclusion happens, individuals with higher social anxiety or social anxiety disorder become more vulnerable in social situations. Individuals lose their ability to get used to social situations when they suffer long-term social exclusion. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is suggested to be a helpful therapy for individuals suffering from long-term social exclusion and social anxiety disorder.",

Health professionals diagnose and attempt to treat or otherwise address the impairments that people \"have.\" The social model of disability, however, locates the problem of disability within society. Developed within the civil and human rights movements, the social model indicates that impairments do not cause disabilities. In addition to dealing with various degrees of an unaccommodating society, individuals with disabilities have to cope with the impairments themselves. The emotional distress from acquired disabilities, however, may not always follow the expected trajectory of decreasing as time passes. Although the evidence of the physical, psychological, and social benefits of physical activity for people with disabilities is overwhelming, the majority of individuals with disabilities are sedentary. When exercise practitioners work with people with disabilities, the disability is rarely the main focus.",

In the work reported here, we showed that this is not the whole story: Three-year-old children are promiscuous normativists. In other words, they spontaneously inferred the presence of social norms even when an adult had done nothing to indicate such a norm in either language or behavior. And children of this age even went so far as to enforce these self-inferred norms when third parties “broke” them. These results suggest that children do not just passively acquire social norms from adult behavior and instruction; rather, they have a natural and proactive tendency to go from “is” to “ought.” That is, children go from observed actions to prescribed actions and do not perceive them simply as guidelines for their own behavior but rather as objective normative rules applying to everyone equally.",

      "abstract": "The group of morons may be subdivided, but brevity compels us to consider it as one. In every aspect of crime, ranging from petty misdemeanors to those major crimes which are punishable by death or prison incarceration, the great mass of criminals belong to this group. The moron is something more than a mental defective. He often has the physical attributes of a normal being, and until he becomes a transgressor of the law he is looked upon as a normal member of society. With a mental age of eight years an adult individual cannot be expected to conform to the conventions laid down for him by a social order which does not find itself in sympathy with his strivings, his problems, or his actual delinquency. Society has in the past adopted a traditional code which the individual must observe, and if this is not accomplished wholly or in part, he is said to be asocial, and may find himself in conflict with the law. Law, after all, is but a set of rules, customs, or usage, the observance of which enables us to live together in more or less harmony. The sex crimes are committed by this individual because an adult body craves sex expression, and a child's mind, which is endowed with a child's intelligence, commits the error in judgment as to when, where, and with whom this sex outlet is to be gratified, thereby often resulting in sexual attack ending in murder. The highgrade moron often extends these sexual attacks to include various forms of sadism, fellatio, homosexuality, and the practice of weird and fanatical rituals, all centering themselves around a distorted and abnormal reasoning power of a child. We find these individuals infesting all classes and strata of society, insinuating themselves, with abnormal cunning, into the most conservative and dignified social sets, in which even the recognition of their propensities does not always lead to the segregation or the social ostracism which we might expect.",

As an example, are highlighted as the most common, family problems, some kind of financial crisis, problems with their health or a problem for which happiness does not achieve in their daily tasks, among others.\r\n     Others, despite having excellent compensation for the tasks entrusted, fail to develop full satisfaction in the execution of them, regardless of whether this situation generates a hypothetical personal and family fulfillment. This refers to the fact that sometimes an integral part of the person is sacrificed, up to his or her own dignity, in order to sustain a subjective ideal of emotional stability.\r\n     It could also be concluded that the lack of taste for their work, is due to the organizational culture in the company, the functions performed, the boss or directives, the work environment is not the best, growth policies or benefit systems are not ambitious enough to satisfy its employees.\r\n     However, it is evident in most cases, some factors that affect the performance of the companies and organizations themselves. Of the most relevant or common, stand out, the loss of days of work, this situation, which translates into significant economic costs for entities, since absenteeism is often associated with the reduction in performance and productivity, increase in unsafe work practices, greater number of complaints and claims from customers, and increased costs.\r\n     Both public and private entities present this problem on a different scale. Some with a higher rate of absenteeism, and others with a somewhat lower figure; the development of this work is in order to reduce the percentages of absenteeism on the part of public EPS officials; and also aims to consolidate a Plan for Improvement of such shortcomings, which include strategies for verification, identification, prevention and possible solution, which may, at the discretion of the entity, become effective.\r\n     The public EPS that was the object of study and the primary basis for the development of this investigative essay, is located in the city of Bogota, Colombia.

      "abstract": "Drug misuse and juvenile delinquency share overlapping aetiologies that are complex and multifaceted and include parental, social, psychological, environmental, and economic aspects. Initiation, maintenance, and even escalation of drug use and criminal behaviour in an individual are heavily influenced by social factors like culture, neighbourhood, and family. Juvenile delinquency can be influenced and sustained by factors such as family structure and functioning, broken homes, absent or unsatisfactory interpersonal relationships, unbalanced parenting, lack of guidance, economic instability, substance abuse or addiction in the family or among peers, access to addictive substances, exposure to physical, sexual, emotional abuse or trauma violence, and peer pressure. Psychological factors that can result in drug use and criminal behaviour include high stress, personality traits like high impulsivity or sensation seeking, depression, and anxiety. People who develop substance use disorders have excessive dependencies, which may initially be reinforced because they lower stress and lift spirits. The belief that drugs can provide solace and help lift one above all misery, which underlies continued drug use, is associated with this reduction. There has also been evidence of an association between early violent behaviour, impulsivity, and problems with concentration or attention.",

Also sexual abuse in children is defined as engaging a child in sexual acts that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the taboos of our society. Sexual abuse may involve direct acts perpetrated against children as well as other non-touching abuses, which include exhibitionism, voyeurism, or the use of children for pornographic purposes.Although precise incidence and prevalence rate data are lacking, sexual abuse of children is common in our country and throughout the world. Child sexual abuse is a universal problem that has frequently passed unrecognized and its victims (both children and perpetrators) untreated. Child sexual abuse results in significant social damage. The physical and psychological consequences of child sexual abuse may result in trauma and has implications throughout the lifespan. Experiencing sexual abuse as a child also has the consequence of contributing to an increased risk of violent victimization, perpetration, self-directed violence and suicide later in life.Despite the importance of the issues, information about sexual abuse in children and amongst adults has not been commonly shared by health professionals. The purpose of this review article is to assist the physician in their investigation of child sexual abuse by exploring the important topics.",

      "title": "Consequences of lonely experience in adolescents",
      "abstract": "The article explores the consequences of experiencing loneliness in adolescents, highlighting the negative impact on mental, physical and social health. Because adolescents feel the need to communicate and receive affection, aspiring to be understood and to have an interlocutor with whom to be honest. This stage of life often comes with emotional intensity, a state of euphoria, periods of sadness and, sometimes, a distancing from family, especially in situations of misunderstanding on the part of adults. The main danger at this stage refers to an excessive concern for oneself or the escape from interactions with others. The inability to form trusting relationships with others generates a feeling of loneliness. Relevant studies on the causes and factors that can lead to social isolation, as well as its effects on adolescents, emphasize the complexity and ambiguity of this phenomenon. The lack of a clear picture of how adolescents experience loneliness suggests that this phenomenon can take various forms. These forms can be manifested in different contexts of social isolation, either by choosing to isolate themselves or being forced to withdraw, and can influence both personal development and a wide range of causes, manifestations and effects on the existence of adolescents. When these needs are not met, there is a risk of developing emotional and social loneliness, the absence of connections with loved ones, and the search for belonging to informal groups. The article also analyzes theoretical perspectives on the fundamental needs of adolescents and how the lack of emotional connections affects personal development. Loneliness is associated with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, poor academic performance and risk behaviors, such as substance use or suicide attempts. Social isolation also influences physical health by increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders. The article emphasizes the importance of multidimensional interventions for the prevention and management of this phenomenon, recommending emotional support, social activities and the development of communication skills.",

In its extreme form jealousy can be pathological, when the belief which may be a delusion, obsession or an overvalued idea, is held on inadequate grounds and is unaffected by rational discussion. Morbid jealousy differs from normal jealousy in its intensity or rationality. It can be thought of as hypersensitive jealousy since jealous reactions are experienced at a much lower threshold than in average individuals. Morbid jealousy is a disorder in which an individual believes that their partner is, or will be, sexually unfaithful. Morbid jealousy can occur when a partner is in fact being unfaithful, provided that the evidence for the infidelity is incorrect and there is an excessive or irrational response to such evidence. The preoccupation with the partner's infidelity is often triggered by vivid mental images of their partner's past or present relationships.",

Although there are various sets of conditions that contribute to the emergence and operation of social movements—such as some degree of perceived political opportunity, organization, and resource acquisition, none of these factors is more important than the generation of mobilizing grievances. After all, it is difficult to imagine most individuals engaging in social movement activity without feeling deeply aggrieved about some condition that is regarded as contrary to the interests, rights, moral principles, or well‐being of themselves or others. Consider the adherents of the pro‐choice and pro‐life movements, and of those advocating for and against same‐sex marriages in the United States or immigration and tighter border control throughout much of the developed world. Not only are the adherents of one movement deeply aggrieved by the prospect of the other movement achieving its goals, but their passions about their movement are often palpable and thus worn, metaphorically, on their sleeves. Certainly other motivational factors—such as curiosity, the desire for approval, and peer pressure—may come into play when considering why people align themselves with a particular movement, but these usually are secondary and largely irrelevant in the absence of deeply felt grievances.",

      "abstract": "The generality of failure theory links arrest – a \"failure\" at crime – to other failures later on in life such as getting a sexually transmitted disease or losing a job. Yet, this theoretical orientation also suggests the opposite may be true. Early life failures such as failing a class in school and becoming an underage parent may be a marker of an individual likely to fail at crime later in life. We test this theory using eleven waves of data from the Pathways to Desistance survey. Findings demonstrate that both personal failures (e.g., becoming an underage parent, failing a class) and public failures (e.g., being fired from a job, suspended from school) early in life are significantly associated with failing at crime later in life. Results persist even after accounting for a wide range of potential confounding factors such as criminal offending, illicit substance use, IQ, and self-control. Findings highlight the utility of the generality of failure theory in understanding deviant behavior.",

They function at a higher level, utilizing their personal strengths, skills, and abilities to contribute to their own well-being as well as that of others and society. They are more likely to be compassionate and, therefore, to contribute to the moral fiber of society in diversely beneficial ways. They are less prone to experience depression and, if they do, tend to manage it better and more quickly. They are less likely to experience anxiety, stress, or anger. As a result, happy people engage in fewer acts of violence or antisocial behaviors. They enjoy stronger and more-lasting relationships, thus facilitating society's social capital. In all, they contribute to society in economic, social, moral, spiritual, and psychological terms. Compared to unhappy or depressed people, the happier ones are less of a burden to health services, social welfare agencies, or police and justice systems and so are less of a burden to the economy.1 In other words, building greater levels of individual happiness not only benefits a particular person but also leads to the healthy, happy functioning of society as a whole…",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is defined as fear or worry to a perceived, imminent challenge or threat either in the present or the future. The experience would be an exaggeration in the perception of situational threats. This may cause muscular tension and guarded behaviors. The prevalence of anxiety among adults in Pakistan is 34% (range 29-66% for women and 10-33% for men).1 There is a high prevalence of anxiety in adolescents more in male gender, 22.5% 2, and an estimate of 65% in the shelter homes and 51% in the community samples of children.3 Variation in anxiety is attributable to the difference in perception and symptoms related to a threatening situation. For example, Generalized Anxiety is characterized by excessive worry about numerous things. In Social Anxiety the individual is fearful or avoidant of social interaction and situations that involve the possibility of being scrutinized. Separation Anxiety refers to fear of separation from an attachment figure. Stage Fright is characterized by a consistent failure to speak at public occasions. Among students it is common to experience Exam or Performance Anxiety, which falls under the umbrella of generalized anxiety disorder. Performance anxiety presents with worries about failure in regards to accomplishing something specific or a fear of failing to perform effectively in similar situations. It is generally noted that anxious students perform poorly and are less motivated in highly evaluated exam situations as compared to a relaxed student.4 Multiple factors can lead to the development of anxiety among students negatively impacting their performance that include; self-doubt, insufficient preparation, fear of scrutiny, and facing failure.5 Anxiety is curable and at the same time treatable. Anxiety gets worse when not attended to by engaging with appropriate services. Among students, clarity in their study goals and a stepwise approach towards their future goals can help ease the burden and the tension (anxiety) about it. A good routine and healthy eating habits have always been noted with mental well-being. Conducting a self-evaluation to determine one’s strengths and areas for improvement and adopting a clear, feasible study plan coupled with consistency has been proven very effective.",

      "abstract": "As many as one third of all women have experienced sexual victimization as juveniles, and a range of emotional, inter-personal, and sexual problems appear to be frequent among these victims. On the current evidence, it is not possible to determine the extent to which these problems are a direct result of the exploitive sexual encounter or of other circumstances in the victims' lives. Nor can the incidence rates for various problems among victimized and non-victimized women be stated with any certainty, the samples on which estimates are made being biased and limited in many ways. Emotionally, the problems of guilt, low self-esteem, and depression, are extremely common among victims, especially those who seek treatment. The interpersonal relationships of many victims are characterized by feelings of isolation, alienation, and difference from other people, together with much mistrust and insecurity. There is some conflict of evidence over the prevalence of hostile or fearful attitudes towards men. Some victims do appear to avoid a lasting relationship with a man and many engage in a series of more transient and casual relationships. Prostitution also seems to be associated with sexual victimization in childhood. Among victims there appear to be tendencies to oversexualize all relationships with men, to engage repeatedly in ill-matched and punitive partnerships, and to exhibit a fear of intimacy. The evidence is contradictory on the incidence of homosexuality among women victims. Sexual problems, and more particularly sexual dysfunctions, appear to be more frequent among victimized compared to non-victimized women, The dysfunctions exhibited include lack of motivation, sexual phobias, vaginismus, impaired arousal, difficulty in reaching climax, dyspareunia, and sexual dissatisfaction. There is wide variation in adjustment between women victims, and among the factors that may contribute to these individual differences are the age of the child victim, the duration of the victimization, the nature of the sexual activity involve, and the perception of the woman concerning her feelings at the time of the victimization and its effects on her.",

      "abstract": "The article reviews data, much of rather recent origin, bearing on the assumption that human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood. The available data permit the following conclusions: l. We have no compelling evidence of a predictable relationship between child training practices and later personality. 2. Severe psychological stresses can have as marked effects in adulthood as in infancy and childhood, sometimes having greater effects in adulthood than in childhood. 3. Important personality changes occur after childhood (in the absence of treatment) including the disappearance of marked psychological disorders. 4. Infants reared according to ostensibly ideal methods of infant care show no greater immunity to mental illness than do other children reared differently. Infants reared under apparently inadequate or harmful circumstances do not necessarily develop psychological disorders. 5. Resemblances between patterns of behavior in children and adults can be explained without the hypothesis of a special impressionability or vulnerability of personality in childhood. 6. The initial immobility and the prolonged physical dependency of children upon adults places them at a special disadvantage in that they cannot readily change their environments to obtain new experiences. A lack of new experiences may give to the personality a pattern which appears more fixed than it really is. The assumption that the human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood remains unproven. Neither is it disproven. We need much further research in this area and this research may eventually show that the human personality is more plastic during childhood in some respects, but not in others.",

      "abstract": "Our society normally regulates a certain range of activities; it is illegal to perform these activities unless one has received prior permission to do so. We require automobile operators to have licenses. We forbid people from practicing medicine, law, pharmacy, or psychiatry unless they have satisfied certain licensing requirements. These general criteria for regulatory licensing can certainly be applied to parents. First, parenting is an activity potentially very harmful to children. The potential for harm is apparent: each year more than half a million children are physically abused or neglected by their parents. Many millions more are psychologically abused or neglected not given love, respect, or a sense of self-worth. The results of this maltreatment are obvious. Abused children bear the physical and psychological scars of maltreatment throughout their lives. Far too often they turn to crime. They are far more likely than others to abuse their own children. Even if these maltreated children never harm anyone, they will probably never be well-adjusted, happy adults. Therefore, parenting clearly satisfies the first criterion of activities subject to regulation. This discussion is abhorrent and needs to be supplanted with a more child-centered view. Parents who hold this view may well maltreat their children. If these parents happen to treat their children well, it is only because they want to, not because they think their children deserve or have a right to good treatment. Moreover, this belief is manifestly at odds with the conviction that parents should prepare children for life as adults. Children subject to parents who perceive children in this way are likely to be adequately prepared for adulthood. Hence, to prepare children for life as adults and to protect them from maltreatment, this attitude toward children must be dislodged. As I have argued, licensing is a viable way to protect children. Furthermore, it would increase the likelihood that more children will be adequately prepared for life as adults than is now true.",

Most commonly, a juvenile delinquent is defined as someone who has transgressed the law: 'a young person who has been prosecuted and found guilty of an offence that would be classified as a crime if committed by an adult' (Graham 1991). This definition has the virtue of precision. Its limitation however is that is does not take into account the full extent of behaviour or attitude. In psychodynamic terms, delinquency carries a much broader meaning: it relates to a more fundamental concern about responsibility and honesty, both in relation to oneself and to others. The essence of delinquency lies in its failure of duty to meet both the legal and moral requirements of the prevailing social order. The word itself draws its source from the Latin linquere – to leave, forsake or abandon. The delinquent is unable or unwilling to do that which is owed to the group, community or society. Delinquency is thus not an activity confined to a criminal minority, but refers to a tendency that is integral to the development of all social relationships.",

      "title": "The Life Mission Theory IV. Theory on Child Development",
      "abstract": "We can identify five important needs that children have: the need for acknowledgment, acceptance, awareness or attention, respect, and care. If these needs are not met, children will modify themselves by denying central parts of their nature in order to adjust to their parents and the situation at large. When a child denies his or her talents, powers, and gender or aspects thereof, he or she loses quality of life, the ability to function, and physical or mental health. The loss of ability takes the form of diminished social ability, psychosexual potency, joy, energy, and fantasy while playing, as well as diminished ability to concentrate, focus, and learn. Many modifications result in a child with severely damaged self-confidence, self-worth, and poor performance. A child more or less deprived of self-worth cannot enjoy, give, or receive. A child deprived of emotions turns cold, rational, asocial, socially stiff, uncomfortable, and in the extreme case ... intentionally “evil”. When a child denies his or her own sex, it becomes invisible, uninteresting, and vague or becomes like the opposite sex in behavior and appearance. The general holistic solution to the vast diversity of symptoms in children with low quality of life is to improve the situation for the child and give the child the holding and support he or she needs. It is very important to realize that a negative belief often has survival value to the child as it helps the child to avoid taking responsibility for problems, which really belong to the parents or other adults. Children have a fine capability for spontaneous healing, and seem to enter this process more easily than adults, given sufficient holding. The symptoms of children with poor thriving ability are often difficult to understand, as they are caused by a complex combination of self-modification in five existential dimensions. This often leads to complex medical diagnosis, giving the idea that the child is sick and without therapeutic reach, while sufficient holding could solve the problem. If holding and support of the child is not enough, the situation must be carefully analyzed to find other possible causes of poor quality of life, health, and functional ability. Education of the parent in holding is often mandatory. Most children with bad thriving ability can thus be helped by simple means.",

      "title": "Western Sport and Spiritualism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sport activity of achievement-oriented (professional, Olympic, spectacular character) is first of all exposition of rivalry and striving for variously understood sports success (resulting from measurable or discretionary criteria). It refers to winning a competition or taking another expected place as well as to other forms of satisfaction, such as financial gratification or social (political, ethnic, professional) recognition. Spirituality is here neither an aim, nor an expected value - it constitutes rather an additional or redundant quality. A competitor focuses his/her attention first of all on the main aim assumed in planned or current rivalry. Emotional sensations which are experienced by athletes before, during or after competitions testify to mental and emotional stress which accompanies sports combat. It is also difficult to associate spirituality or spiritualism with sport for all - like, for example, that of health-oriented character - sport of the disabled, physical education, sport of playful character or physical recreation. That difficulty results from the fact that neither spiritualism, nor spirituality inspires for physical activity in the abovementioned fields; neither spiritualism, nor spirituality is the outcome of activity in the realm of sport for all. Exceptions are constituted by ancient Olympic Games as well as by some experiences connected with recreational forms of tourism mediated through achievement-oriented sport (also by pre-Columbian Native American societies and Maoris aboriginal population of New Zealand). For example Hellenic Olympic Games were a highly spiritualized form of sports rivalry - including also rivalry in the field of art, and especially in the field of theatre. They were one of numerous forms of religious cult - of worshipping chosen gods from the Olympic pantheon. On the other hand, during mountain hiking and mountain climbing there can appear manifestations of deepened spirituality characteristic for the object of spiritualization of non-religious, quasi-religious or strictly religious qualities. I would like to explain - at the end of this short abstract - that spiritualism (which should not be confused with spiritism) is - generally speaking - first of all a philosophical term assuming, in ontological and axiological sense, that spiritual reality, self-knowledge, consciousness or mental experiences are components of the human being - components of a higher order having priority over matter. They constitute, in the anthropological context, beings of a higher order than the body. Spiritualism according to its popular interpretation means spirituality. Qualities which are ascribed to that notion in particular societies can be determined on the basis of empirically oriented sociological research. They make it possible to determine various ways of interpreting and understanding that notion as well as views or attitudes connected with it.",

      "abstract": "Being social creatures, humans need a safe and secure social environment to exist. For one's physical and emotional well-being, it is imperative to have satisfying social connections. Loneliness may result from a lack of social connections. Intimacy and a sense of belonging are fundamental human desires. Interpersonal connections have several advantages. Loneliness has been perceived as a universal human experience since the dawn. Social connection is essential for everyone's survival. People are innately social beings that rely on one another for assistance. Even though mental health issues and social isolation often coexist in young children, early isolation does not indicate worse mental health issues in the future. However, children with such issues and behaviors could find it difficult to handle the social difficulties they face as they advance through the early years of school. Humans are social animals, and when they don't feel connected, they tend to get sadder, sicker, and more susceptible to developing depression and other mental health problems. Isolation is a frequent occurrence that become more prevalent during the COVID-19 global pandemic, having an adverse effect on people's physical and mental health everywhere. Furthermore, according to the most recent data, there may be an increase in the prevalence of mental health problems among at-risk groups and persons who are vulnerable to them after the pandemic's height. 6 Children and adolescents, the elderly, people who are unemployed or homeless, COVID-19 survivors, people with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, community workers, pregnant women, people who are physically or mentally disabled, migrants, refugees, and members of the LGBT community, as well as people who belong to racial or ethnic minorities, are among the vulnerable populations. Loneliness in the elderly beings and social isolation pose a substantial threat to public health because they increase the risk of dementia and other serious disorders in a huge number of people.",

They and their families are more likely to be socially isolated and to suffer material and emotional poverty. The range of emotional reactions in carers can vary at different times from extreme overprotection, through relative equanimity, to sometimes outright hatred and rejection of the child. Society largely reflects this, only rarely viewing the individual with learning disability in a positive way, choosing often to pity, patronise, ignore, ridicule or openly despise. These attitudes are internalised by children with the disability, who invariably suffer from low self-esteem. All of these factors combine to facilitate abuse.",

      "title": "Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Traumatic events have permeated our lives throughout history and across the globe, inflicting profound losses on individuals, families, and communities during warfare, armed conflict, natural disasters, and relational violence. Although many survivors of these events harness their resilience and cope without long-term negative mental health effects, others experience a range of physical and mental health conditions, including trauma- and stress-related disorders. With an emphasis placed on adult trauma survivors, the conditions of posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, complex trauma, and other stress-related conditions have been explored within a social context. Starting with a historical context, the following topics were addressed. The typologies of trauma were introduced including the definitions of Type I trauma—a single discrete event including natural catastrophes; Type II trauma—chronic and repetitive traumatic physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse; and Type IIII—severe and multiple abusive events with multiple perpetrators. Historical and intergenerational trauma reflect a collective of complex traumatic events throughout generations that resonate in subsequent generations in terms of ungrieved losses and survivor guilt, among other psychosocial issues. Cultural and racial trauma include chronic verbal and/or physical assaults that involve racialized bigotry. Combat trauma involves a combination of deployment stressors that have affected servicemembers in distinct ways with “signature injuries” associated with different wartime conflicts. The next section addresses the current typology of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>—V, noting the changes in diagnostic criteria, in particular related to the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mental health responses to trauma vary a great deal based on a balance of risk and protective factors, often revealing noteworthy resilience and the absence of negative aftereffects. The neurobiological effects of trauma are addressed along with mental health conditions or disorders (e.g., acute stress response, PTSD, complex trauma, and anxiety disorders). Specific phase-oriented and multimodality treatment interventions are reviewed that focus specifically on the mental health conditions presented. These approaches are research-informed, culturally responsive, and theoretically grounded Finally, the responses experienced by clinicians who work with traumatized clients are outlined along with recommendations for ways to minimize the effects of secondary, or vicarious, traumatization. Clinical <underline>v</underline>ignettes based on case composites have been utilized to illustrate central points.",

      "abstract": "Chapter 3 explores the contribution of the lifecourse approach and social gerontology to understanding mental health outcomes in later life. It also explores the role played by health and social inequalities. By bringing these perspectives together the Chapter makes visible the ways in which lifecourse inequality and adversity e.g. childhood abuse, create and/or amplify risks to mental health in later life. It also exposes the embedded and structural nature of causative mechanisms. Health inequalities have profound implications for mental health. People from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds suffer disproportionately from common mental disorders, such as depression, across the whole lifecourse. They are also exposed to higher levels of chronic psychosocial stress which, independently and additively, undermines mental wellbeing. These effects are cumulative over the longer term and in more unequal societies; also by exposure to discrimination and oppression. These arguments challenge the dominance of the ‘inevitable decline’ model of ageing exposing a more nuanced complex set of intersecting risks to mental health that are structurally located and socially produced. The role of policy in addressing health inequalities and their social determinants was a key dimension of mental health policy until 2011; since then it has become increasingly uncoupled from the policy agenda.",

      "title": "Joining the Legal Significance of Adolescent Development Capacities with the Legal Rights Provided by In re Gault",
      "abstract": "Almost forty years after the United States Supreme Court decided In re Gault, the Court in Roper v. Simmons ruled that the death penalty is a disproportionate punishment for persons under the age of eighteen, in violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Perhaps the most compelling reasons the Roper Court offered for its decision were those that drew upon recent scientific insights into the bio-psychosocial aspects of adolescent development to corroborate the view that juveniles are less culpable for their crimes than adults. Court made three bold findings in distinguishing juveniles from adults: 1) A lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults...These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions and decisions; 2) Juveniles are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure....Youth is....a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage; and 3) The character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult. personality traits of juveniles are more transitory, less fixed. Although Roper will always be best known as the case that abolished the juvenile death penalty in America, the decision is at least equally noteworthy for its endorsement and application of scientific findings relating to adolescent developmental immaturity. This article considers the implications of Roper's findings for the application of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights extended to juveniles in Gault.",

      "title": "Health-related behaviours in context",
      "abstract": "Health behaviours, sometimes referred to as (health) risk behaviours, theoretically refer to any practices, habits or actions which, either in the short or long term, have an effect on health, either positively or negatively. In medicine generally, and life-course epidemiology specifically, they are often conceptualized as components of an individual's lifestyle, or even as lifestyles themselves. By virtue of human agency, or at least the potential for agency, they are distinguished from social structure (e.g. social class) which is typically understood as an external (material and/or cultural) constraint. In most studies, they are usually represented by four behaviours; diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption, and (increasingly) in the case of young people illicit drug use. Sexual behaviour is also referred to, but as the subject of another chapter, is not included here. From a sociological perspective, these behaviours are not so easily reducible to lifestylevariables, nor are they necessarily dis-embedded from social structure. Each is imbued with social meaning, both in the way they are socially constructed through, for example, advertising and the media and in the way they are consumed, and displayed by individuals. For young people, they are especially strong signifiers of identity since they are so closely connected with the youth-adult transition, minimum ages for the legal purchase of tobacco and alcohol marking stages in the achievement of adult status in most developed countries. They are also remarkably precise signifiers of youth identities, group membership and subcultures, as indicated by the way particular young people engage in physical activity (and which activities), whether they smoke or drink (and which brands they consume) or use illicit drugs (and which drugs). The extent to which such health behaviours continue to be shaped by social structures such as social class, and the extent to which they are lifestyle choices, is an important indicator of where any society is positioned in late modernity. This chapter begins with a brief overview of the social epidemiology of diet, physicalactivity, smoking, drinking and drug use among youth in developed societies, focusing on health consequences, prevalence issues, and age, gender and cross-national variations. A review of ethnic group and religious differences is beyond the scope of the chapterthough they are clearly important (e.g. for diet and alcohol). Developing from this, against the background of the structure/agency debate (Furlong and Cartmel 2007), and representing the former by young people's social class of origin, the latter by various lifestyles, an assessment is made of the relative importance of each for health behaviours in contemporary society. The chapter concludes with a closer look at the social contexts within which young people's health behaviours are developed, and the social processes involved. It is within these particular contexts, notably the school and the peer group, that the meaning of health behaviours for identity, group membership and lifestyles can best be understood. Because most research has been undertaken on young people of school-age, the focus is primarily on 'early youth' though the implications extend beyond school.",

The international Convention on the Rights of the Child, almost universally ratified, limits parental powers, and duties, by adolescents' evolving capacities for self-determination. Legal systems may recognize mature minors as enjoying adult rights of medical consent, even when consent to sexual relations does not absolve partners of criminal liability; their consent does not make the adolescents offenders. There is usually no chronological age of consent for medical care, but a condition of consent, meaning capacity for understanding. Like adults, mature minors enjoy confidentiality and the right to treatment according to their wishes rather than their best interests. Minors incapable of self-determination may grant or deny assent to treatment for which guardians provide consent. Emancipated minors' self-determination may also be recognized, for instance on marriage or default of adults' guardianship.",

Unlike alcohol or drug abuse, suppression of sexual behavior is not an option, only compulsive character must be suppressed in order to allow a full and satisfying sexuality. The purpose of this observation is to explore the psychological and physical consequences of sexual addiction. We report the case of a patient with sexual addiction, in order to describe the impact of this addiction on his psychological and physical health. Mr. JG is 28 a years old man, he has no particular habits and no significant pathological history. He was addressed by his general practitioner for \"excessive masturbation\". His sexual history is characterized by: - An excessive interest in pornographic films since the age of 13, - An extremely rich fantasy life, - Frequent compulsive masturbation, going up to ten times a day. Through the years, this hyper sexuality has become more important, and masturbation more frequent, which resulted in: - Permanent feeling of embarrassment and shame, - Ideas permanently focused on sexual thoughts, - Fatigue and chronical physical exhaustion, - Constant muscle pain and headache, diminished visual acuity. - Relationship difficulties, and social maladjustment, - Depression and suicidal thoughts. The evaluation by the Carnes scale found a score of 16/25, which corresponds to a severe sexual addiction. The boundary between normal and pathological depends on the models and taboos of society, but for physicians, the major criteria for sexual addiction are mental suffering, social maladjustment, and demand of care.",

      "abstract": "Every child that is born with expectation of living and fulfilling life’s expectancy. The quality of life approach focuses on what is most important to every individual. However, each child is born with different challenges and peculiarity in the area of intellectual capacity. The condition could be present at birth as a congenital abnormality. An individual may be physically fit with no brain or body abnormalities and yet be mentally disabled. The terms mild, moderate, severe and profound are often used to classify intellectual disability. In view of this, it has been observed that poor motor control, high physical demand, fear of accident and social exclusion could limit the involvement of persons with intellectual disability in activities related to sport or physical activity. Therefore, it is needful to achieve social inclusion and quality of life for persons with intellectual disability through sports and physical activity.",

      "title": "Belonging, Respectful Inclusion, and Diversity in Medical Education",
      "abstract": "Belonging is the experience of being accepted, included, and valued by others. A fundamental human motivation, belonging positively influences an individual's health, abilities, relationships, and overall well-being.1 Belonging is an interpretation of cues that suggests that one fits in and is welcome in a given context; it is an inference based on observations, interactions, values, and past events that define the culture and environment.2 Encountering discrimination, exclusionary practices, bias, and microaggressions interferes with the experience of belonging. Uncertainty about belonging, or worse, certainty of not belonging can contribute to isolation, diminished capacity for trust, emotional distress, lessened effectiveness, exhaustion, and serious health issues.2–5 Individuals who identify as members of underrepresented groups can be profoundly and disproportionately affected by these concerns.3 Respectful inclusion in the health professions of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds, identities, and life experience is increasingly understood for its primacy in preparing an innovative and representative workforce, addressing health disparities, advancing science, and serving the needs of the public.6,7 Respectful inclusion is vital to the future of medicine and requires new ideas and new practices, as illustrated very thoughtfully in several articles8–17 appearing in this issue of Academic Medicine. Committing to a more diverse and vibrant future requires self-honesty, creativity, and courage in tackling aspects of the culture of medicine that may interfere with people from all backgrounds feeling welcomed, included, and valued—namely, feeling that they truly belong. Belonging Cues Individuals may experience certain aspects of medical education as threats to a secure sense of belonging. For example, the populations of students and faculty of U.S. medical schools do not reflect our country's general population. Poor representation or nonrepresentation may suggest that some people are valued over others in the culture of medicine. This year, for the first time, women outnumber men enrolled in medical school,18 with a gender balance that more closely matches that of the general population. And yet, individuals enrolled in medical school in 2019–2020 identify as 50% white, 22% Asian, 7% black or African American, and 7% Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin,18 while the U.S. population identifies as 60% non-Hispanic white, 6% Asian, 13% black or African American, and 18% Hispanic or Latino.19 Decades of effort to promote diversity in admissions have led to uneven results. To illustrate, between 1980 and 2016, the proportion of black or African American medical school matriculants rose only slightly, from 6% to 7%, and the proportion of Hispanic matriculants rose from 5% to 6%. American Indian/Alaska Native matriculants declined to 0.3% in 2016 from 0.4% in 1980, despite increasing year after year in the general population.20 In 2018–2019, 24 of 53 applicants who identified as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander were accepted to medical schools, and 44 of 109 who identified as Alaska Native/American Indian were accepted.21 Postgraduate medical education overall tends to be more diverse, especially in primary care fields, although certain fields of training22 are very narrow in terms of demographic characteristics. Bringing greater representation to all specialty fields poses challenges. In 2019, for example, there were more black or African American and Hispanic applicants to family medicine programs than to dermatology, neurology, orthopedic surgery, otolaryngology, pathology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, radiation oncology, and urology combined.23 The composition of medical school faculty is evolving, with greater numbers and proportions of women and individuals who identify as traditionally underrepresented in medicine (URiM), especially among earlier career faculty members.24,25 That said, in a recent survey26 inquiring about the major professional activity of medical school faculty members, only 516 individuals who identified as black or African American reported medical teaching as their primary focus, and only 294 reported research. In this survey, only 2 Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander individuals reported administration as their main professional activity. Persistent underrepresentation of some groups in medical schools may lead to the perception that some groups are less welcome and their presence less supported, impeding the experience of belonging. As noted by Walton et al,27 this perception should not be denied or dismissed, as it is not unjustified: \"it reflects the external world, and the risks a person faces\" when a group that has been historically excluded encounters stereotype threat or, for whatever reason, experiences disadvantage or negative repercussions in a given context. In her essay28 entitled \"A Dark Spot on a White Canvas,\" Dr. Lia Thomas describes this inner experience from when she was a medical student: The thought was there, gnawing in the back of my mind, whispering at me when gross anatomy got tough…. \"You do not really belong here; you took someone else's spot.\" I would not dare voice these feelings to my friends or to my advisors. A part of me was afraid that they would think less of me for feeling inadequate; another part of me knew with certainty that they already knew I was inadequate.28(p455) As Dr. Thomas assumed leadership roles as a faculty member, she felt paradoxically both visible and invisible. When stressed, she found that the voice of lonely self-doubt returned. Did I not know my place? Had my reach exceeded my grasp?…. And, most importantly, where would I belong?28(p456) Baumeister and Leary1(p521) have cautioned that \"cultures use social inclusion to reward, and exclusion to punish, their members as a way of enforcing their values.\" It is no wonder, then, that feeling out of place causes self-critique, isolation, and feelings of being an \"imposter\" in academic medicine. Moreover, in the presence of other factors, ruptured or thwarted belongingness can contribute to heightened risk for physical health problems as well as emotional distress and self-harmful behaviors.5 Better understanding of the role of belonging in medical schools may help us to understand the distinct and often very serious health care needs of URiM students, as documented in a number of empirical studies.29–31 Another barrier to feelings of belonging among medical students is the observation that that learning environments are not free from hostility, exploitation, and unequal treatment, despite efforts to ensure otherwise. The 2019 Medical School Graduate Questionnaire32 (n = 19,933), conducted by the Association of American Medical Colleges, documented that many respondents (23%) had been \"publicly humiliated\" once (13.1%), occasionally (8.8%), or frequently (0.8%) during their undergraduate medical training. Twenty-one percent reported other students being subjected to such behavior. More than 60 respondents reported being asked during medical school to exchange sexual favors for grades or other rewards. Nearly 1,000 respondents reported being denied opportunities for training or rewards based on gender, and more than 1,100 reported receiving lower evaluations or grades based on gender. A total of 8.5% of respondents had personally experienced \"racially or ethnically offensive remarks/names\" once (4.1%), occasionally (3.9%), or frequently (0.5%) in medical school. More than 500 respondents reported being denied opportunities for training or rewards based on race or ethnicity. A similar number reported receiving lower evaluations or grades based on race or ethnicity. A small proportion of respondents overall reported being subjected to offensive remarks/names (2%) or to unequal treatment (0.7%) at least once related to sexual orientation. It is unclear which students had these experiences, but it should be noted that a total of 7.2% of respondents in the survey self-identified as bisexual, gay, or lesbian, and 0.4% stated that they had a different gender identity from the sex assigned at birth. Many respondents did not report negative experiences such as these to their institutions because they felt that nothing could be done or because they were fearful of reprisal.32 Further, demonstrations of respect for diversity by faculty were reported as occurring either never, almost never, or sometimes by 5.4% of respondents. Demonstrations of respect for students by faculty were reported as occurring either never, almost never, or sometimes by 6.5% of respondents. These findings suggest that the learning climate is not yet fully supportive of our students. While some may argue that these percentages have improved over time—and they clearly have—it is important to remember that a trend does not feel wholly relevant for individuals who are directly experiencing humiliation or unequal treatment. Beyond these threats and barriers, the experience of belonging may be affected, positively or negatively, by rituals and signs of recognition and status in the culture of medicine (e.g., honors, awards, invitations, opportunities). Whether evaluations and letters of recommendation predominantly describe personal attributes (as is more common for women and members of groups traditionally underrepresented in medicine) as opposed to strengths and areas of competence (as is more common for men and members of majority groups in medicine) is a cultural signal that influences opportunities for students and reinforces either belonging or exclusion.33 Students who identify as members of underrepresented minority groups in some settings may carry greater financial debt,34,35 may encounter structural barriers to performance on standardized examinations,36,37 and may be at risk for slower progression and greater attrition.38 How such disparities are addressed will affect students' sense of affiliation, safety, and feelings of either being out of place or \"at home.\" The presence of leaders, mentors, and near-peers who identify as members of underrepresented groups, along with perceptions of their scope of responsibility, power, and control or access to resources, can serve as cultural indicators that augment or lessen feelings of belonging. Whether individuals who identify with underrepresented groups are asked to carry disproportionate burdens of service and representation (the \"minority tax\") can be another environmental cue for students.39 The presence of meaningful and relevant policies, along with evidence of their faithful implementation, can serve to communicate a commitment to respectful inclusivity in a given context. For instance, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education40 has 2 standards pertaining to diversity and inclusion. The first states that each medical school must develop programs or partnerships aimed at broadening diversity among qualified applicants for medical school admission. The second states that each medical school must have policies and practices to achieve appropriate diversity among its students, faculty, staff, and other members of its academic community, and must engage in ongoing, systematic, and focused efforts to attract and retain students, faculty, staff, and others from demographically diverse backgrounds. The existence of concrete manifestations of such ideals is very important, including, for example, intentional curriculum design; adequacy of knowledgeable, sensitive, and well-prepared faculty; the existence of all-gender facilities; and the dedication of spaces for individuals with religious and spiritual beliefs or distinct backgrounds. Opportunities to receive specialized resources, financial assistance, career counseling, and culturally attuned health services, along with the absence of physical symbols that are experienced as objectifying certain groups, further fortify the message of respectful inclusion for medical students. Toward a Culture of Belonging, Respectful Inclusion, and Diversity In this issue of Academic Medicine, our authors take on some of the most difficult challenges that pertain to belonging, respectful inclusion, and diversity in medical education. Several articles offer insights into experiential and cultural issues, and some also offer strategies and practical approaches for implementation. Three articles relate to the selection of students for Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA), a prestigious national honors society in medicine. Byyny et al8 of the AOA Honor Medical Society articulate their society's commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity, emphasizing humility as expressed in the organization's ideal that its members \"Be Worthy to Serve the Suffering.\" The authors acknowledge that the AOA has certain restrictions (e.g., no more than 16% of a medical school's graduating class can be selected) and yet make clear that each of the 132 AOA chapters at medical schools in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Lebanon have the ability to develop and enact selection criteria for medical students, residents, and physicians at different career stages. In a second article, Teherani et al9 describe how the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine examined and changed selection processes for the school's AOA honor society, adopting holistic review, as one effort among many, to dismantle existing inequitable educational structures. Arguing that selection to the AOA reinforces structural biases and social privilege in medical education and runs counter to core tenets of equity and wellness, a third article by Lynch et al10 describes what many will consider a courageous decision to suspend student selection to the AOA at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The authors state that a return to selection of students for the AOA at Icahn will only occur when all students are treated equitably in medicine. The cultural symbolism and influence of the AOA, and of similar honors, are reflected in these 3 articles. In a remarkable qualitative study performed by Ackerman-Barger et al11 at the University of California Davis School of Medicine and Yale University School of Medicine, medical students and nursing students who identified as members of underrepresented groups were interviewed to better understand the role and effects of racial microaggressions in health professions education. This research report is exceptional for its clarity and thematic organization, its engagement of students in 2 health domains, and its sensitive selection of narrative examples to convey, movingly and richly, students' experiences. This project follows on the past work by Orom et al38 documenting, for example, that URiM students face distinct challenges socially and academically, experience their learning environments as less positive, encounter discrimination and racial harassment, and are more likely to see race as negatively affecting their education. An important contribution of the study by Ackerman-Barger et al is the set of recommendations offered by the students themselves related to diversity and allyship, curriculum change, open conversations, and safe spaces. The insights of trainees in bringing forward respectful inclusion practices in the culture of medicine are invaluable, as seen in the example described elsewhere41 of the innovative adoption of 2 new chief resident roles for diversity and inclusion in one clinical department at Yale University School of Medicine. Cook et al12 consider key issues and relevant resources and provide a set of thoughtful recommendations to help academic institutions develop more respectful, supportive, and attuned approaches to trainees who identify as transgender and nonbinary. The authors comment on administrative challenges and recommendations, touching upon culture, policies, data collection, health and wellness, and gendered spaces, and on educational challenges and opportunities in the classroom, clinical teaching, mentorship, and evaluation activities. The AM Last Page13 in this issue of the journal, entitled \"Creating Affirming Health Care Environments for Patients Who Are Gender Diverse,\" complements the valuable contribution by Cook et al12 and builds on the relatively small literature base on this emerging topic.42,43 In their careful review of 89 published articles, Brottman et al14 sought to understand how health care professionals and medical students learn about topics such as implicit bias, health disparities, and the needs of diverse patient populations. Eleven educational strategies for fostering cultural competence were identified in the articles. Few of the published projects demonstrated favorable outcomes. Similar results have been found in studies of college students, in which some strategies for inclusion resulted in feelings of inauthenticity and exclusion among certain groups, despite their opposite intent.27 The review by Brottman et al highlights the important role of faculty expertise and skill and states that the adoption of more clearly articulated goals and refinement of best practices are needed. That review also serves as a reminder of the value of empirical work in informing curricular innovation and campus interventions. In another article in this issue's collection, Sukhera et al15 suggest that transformational learning theory may serve as a useful lens for advancing education on implicit bias and related topics. Focusing on graduate medical education, Gonzaga et al16 propose an approach for meeting Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education standards on creating a diverse and inclusive workforce. The approach features 5 interrelated components: setting diversity as a priority, seeking out candidates, implementing inclusive recruitment practices, investing in trainee success, and building the pipeline. Gardner et al17 describe the use of a new tool, the Situational Judgment Test, in addition to a scoring algorithm, to identify candidates for residency interviews in 7 residency programs. A number of candidates selected in this manner had United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores that previously would not have reached a \"cutoff\" threshold, and the candidates invited for interviews were more diverse than in the past. Respectful inclusion and diversity in health professions education are essential to the learning, well-being, and effectiveness of our early-career colleagues. Respectful inclusion and diversity, furthermore, are essential to the health of the people and populations we are entrusted with serving, now and in the future. The role of belonging in health education, systems, and workforce is also essential, even though that role has thus far been underrecognized. Greater understanding of belonging, Dear Reader, is the key to respectful inclusion and diversity in the health professions. Such understanding will allow us to tackle the hardest issues we together face related to equity and well-being. Laura Weiss Roberts, MD, MA",

      "abstract": "Child abuse is defined as adult physically injuring a child not by accident, but in anger or deliberately . . . in the process of caring for the child. Many abused children are physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or emotionally disturbed either before the abuse or as a result of it. Child abuse is often considered synonymous with child battering or the battered child syndrome. Although it may not seem important to differentiate between the two, they do differ and we should treat them accordingly. The battered child syndrome represents an extreme form of child abuse. Characteristics of perpetrators of this subgroup differ from the larger group. The prevention, treatment, and general prognosis of the victim and the perpetrator also vary greatly from those of simple child abuse. The battered child syndrome is a cross-cultural phenomenon. Abuse in this case is predetermined and can be likened to torture. In many instances, the perpetrator is psychopathic. The beatings are almost always recurrent; the prognosis, poor. Hefler and Kempe suggest that a battered child returned to this environment has a fifty-fifty chance of surviving more than one year.2 Many students of this form of abuse suggest that the child not be returned to his previous environment. Child abuse as a whole, however, presents a different set of characteristics. Even though the battered child syndrome is generally demographically included, several ecological patterns emerge which lend hope to the survival and even much improved environment of the victim.",

      "abstract": "Sexual harassment is unwanted and unwanted behavior or attention of a sexual nature and results in disturbing the harasser. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to: sexual payments for wanting something, coercion of sexual activity, derogatory statements about sexual orientation or sexuality, requests for sexual favors by the perpetrator, speech or behavior that has a sexual connotation; all can be classified as sexual harassment. This action can be conveyed directly or implicitly. The effect is on the victim, who is considered to be causing problems and not the perpetrator. In general, victims will keep their mouths shut, sometimes for a very long time, for these reasons, and there is a fear that they will become targets of abuse. They don't talk about it with friends or family. The healing process will be more difficult when there is denial from the institution, distrust, or blaming the victim. The rampant sexual harassment that is happening in Indonesia is troubling most people. Even during the current covid-19 pandemic, there is an increase in sexual harassment that occurs against women, even worse, it also happens to children who are still underage. Komnas Perempuan identified that during 2001 to 2012, there were at least 35 women who were victims of sexual violence every day. Meanwhile, the data released by Komnas Perempuan during the current covid-19 pandemic is 1,902 cases of sexual harassment that have occurred in Indonesia, as of Saturday, July 3, 2021. In this case, it is clear that there is still a lack of legal protection for cases involving threaten a person's personal personality, especially in cases of sexual harassment to sexual violence.",

      "abstract": "At least 10 per cent of the world's people have a significant, long-term, physical or mental impairment which can and usually does disable them from taking part in the usual educational, social and economic activity in their community. This is due to barriers in attitudes, in the built environment and in the way society is organized, which prevent us from participating on an equal level with others. The reason why most of these barriers exist is because societies have until very recently not recognized that the systematic way in which they discriminate against disabled people, when backed by discriminatory laws and practices of the state, often amounts to oppression. Barnes (1991) gives a full account of the discrimination disabled people encounter in all areas of life. This oppression has developed from our history, from myths and beliefs that attribute characteristics to disabled people which are unrelated to the reality of disabled people's lives. Such collections of attitudes often determine how non-disabled people respond to the 'different' in their midst; how they form stereotypes of the disabled person as saint, sinner, superhero, freak, fiend, victim, obsessive avenger, isolationist, the butt of jokes, just a burden, or someone to be pitied. The particular form of stereotyped thinking depends on the society's history, its explanation of how it has come to be and the resultant culture.",

      "title": "The impact of delayed reporting on the prosecution and outcomes of child sexual abuse cases",
      "abstract": "Children and young people who have been sexually abused sometimes disclose that abuse soon after the event or events occurred, or at least later during childhood. However, many children and young people do not tell anyone about the abuse until decades later, long after they reach adulthood. An unknown number, the ‘dark figure’, never tell anyone or if they do, do not report it to the police. Delayed disclosure and reporting are associated with various characteristics of the victim and perpetrator, and the relationship between them. Older children, for example, are more reluctant to disclose than younger children, and boys are more reluctant than girls. Delayed reporting is particularly common in cases of institutional child sexual abuse; for example, where the abuser is a trusted church member, a teacher, or a staff member in a boarding school or residential care facility. In some cases, the victim has told someone at the time, but has not been believed, or the complaint has not reached the police. Where an adult has reported sexual abuse committed against them as a child, particular forensic difficulties stand in the way of prosecution that do not apply to contemporary reports. These include needing to prove the offence as it was on the statute book at the time it occurred, and addressing issues about the reasons for the delayed complaint. Another barrier to successful prosecution is the likelihood of ‘degraded evidence’. As time goes on, memories fade and evidence which may have corroborated some aspects of the complainant’s account may have been lost; for example, due to the death of another witness. This report examines how the criminal justice systems in New South Wales and South Australia deal with complaints of child sexual abuse reported to the police in childhood compared with those in which the report is delayed until adulthood, which is often referred to as historical child sexual abuse. The research investigates the trends in delayed disclosure and reporting of child sexual abuse, and maps the prosecution process and outcomes associated with varying degrees of delay in 18 reporting to the police, together with other case characteristics such as the age of the complainant victim, and the relationship between the complainant and the alleged offender.",

      "title": "SUBJECTS OF ENVY AMONG YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN: CONTEXTS OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR",
      "abstract": "This article explores the propensity for deviant behavior and the objects of envy among young men and women. Specifically, it examines the following aspects: Appearance: Young individuals often experience jealousy regarding each other's physical appearance, clothing, hairstyle, and more. Envy of attractive attributes may drive both genders to engage in deviant behaviors, such as resorting to drug use or alcohol abuse to achieve these attributes. Social Status: Envy can also revolve around social status, encompassing factors like popularity, academic or athletic success, and group affiliations. Envious feelings related to these aspects may lead to deviant behaviors, including the use of violence or manipulation to attain desired status. Material Goods: Material possessions can be a focal point of envy, motivating young people to engage in theft, deceit, or illicit activities to acquire them. Power and Control: Envy of power and control may serve as another motivator for deviant behavior. For instance, the desire to wield power can lead to attempts to control others or resort to violence to achieve personal objectives. Deviant behaviors often stem from envy, as individuals may seek to obtain desired objects or statuses through wrongful means. For instance, a young man envious of a successful classmate may resort to grade forgery or cheating to attain similar success. Jealousy can also trigger conflicts and violence among individuals. For example, two girls envious of each other's attractiveness or popularity may engage in efforts to undermine each other's lives or even resort to physical aggression. The primary objective of this article is to identify the principal psychological and legal characteristics of envy among male and female students within the context of deviant behavior. The article's objectives include assessing the level of envy among male and female cadets and exploring gender-specific relationships between deviant behavior and envy across various subject areas. It is essential to note that envy alone is not the sole cause of deviant behavior; rather, it is one of several factors influencing young individuals and motivating them to engage in unlawful acts. Additional factors, such as inadequate social support, low self-esteem, or negative environmental influences, also significantly contribute to the development of deviant behavior. In conclusion, this study underscores that envy is not a moral sentiment and highlights the centrality of feelings of inferiority in the experience of envy. Moreover, gender differences in envy, prevalent among youth, tend to diminish as individuals mature.",

      "abstract": "Generally, with the onset of menses, it is reasonable to consider and provide contraceptive counselling for our patients. Despite the variability in timing of menarche for a given patient, the age of consent in Canada is 16. The age of consent is the age at which a young person can legally agree to sexual activity. Age of consent laws apply to all forms of sexual activity, ranging from kissing and fondling to penetrative intercourse. However, a 14- or 15-year-old can consent to sexual activity as long as the partner is less than 5 years older and there is no relationship of trust, authority or dependency or any other exploitation of the young person. There is also a \"close in age\" exception for 12- and 13-year-olds. A 12- or 13-year-old can consent to sexual activity with a partner as long as the partner is less than 2 years older and there is no relationship of trust, authority or dependency or any other exploitation of the young person. As providers of healthcare, we need to be aware of these parameters and begin counselling our patients, if appropriate, to offer options for protection from unplanned pregnancy. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) reaffirmed in the Contraception Consensus 2015, and later updated during the pandemic, that recommendations for screening, duration of use, follow-up assessments, and the provision of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods as first-line contraception methods should be provided. During pandemic situations, provision of family planning services must be adapted in an evidence-based fashion. For young patients, issues regarding care and counselling may include access, privacy, and timing. As health care professionals, we should be removing any barriers in order to offer care and counselling to young patients.",

      "abstract": "PHASE ONE: THE BUILD-UP PHASE The first phase is characterized by minor battering incidents and/or and emotional abuse over imagined or real infractions of rules and expectations of the male partner. The woman sometimes responds calmly, trying to de-escalate the situation or she may attempt to defend her position in the relationship. They may both attempt to rationalize away his behavior as stress reactions related to work or finances, etc. Often the woman believes her adapting behavior will act to control his violence. This tension building phase time lapse varies greatly from the relationship to relationship. For some it may be days or weeks, for others there may be years of tension building between acute incidents. As the tension builds, her coping skills may become less and less effective at protecting herself or de-escalating the tension. It is during this phase that women will often reach out for help or support since they are aware of the increasing danger. Other than services designed for battered women, many community services do not recognize her need at this stage since there is not “evidence of violence.”",

The reality of this stage is so clear that sometimes we let ourselves be blinded by their proximity.

      "abstract": "People with disabilities (PWDs), one of the important minority groups, are exposed to certain attitudes and prejudices causing some problems in social life. Therefore, it is important to examine the causes and consequences of prejudices and attitudes toward PWDs. Our attitudes determine how we evaluate events or people. Our ideas and behaviors about a group or person are also affected by our explicit and implicit attitudes. People have different attitudes and behaviors, either negative or positive. PWDs are considered dependent, needy, incompetent, trustworthy or innocent. They can be perceived in different ways and exposed to both positive/negative attitudes and labeling. Prejudices toward PWDs are generally not shown explicitly due to social approval, but they exist implicitly and still affect the lives of the disabled through negative behaviors they cause. Implicit biases toward PWDs, caused by existential or evolutionary factors, are often not consciously noticed. Implicit biases that are not noticed cannot be intervened and intervention strategies cannot be developed. Hereby, this review aims to examine the attitudes and prejudices toward PWDs within the scope of explicit and implicit processes and to discuss the differences between explicit and implicit prejudices as well as the social-psychological effects of implicit prejudices and different ways to measure them.",

A broad consensus notes two phenotypes in early childhood—one characterized by socially withdrawn behavior and restricted positive affect and the other by disinhibited social behavior and repeated violations of conventional interpersonal boundaries. Reactive attachment disorder seems to be quite responsive to enhanced caregiving environments, although the indiscriminate behavior of disinhibited social engagement disorder persists in some cases even after affected children receive enhanced caregiving.",

The traumas vary widely from physical abuse to being parented by someone suffering a serious psychiatric illness or alcohol addiction. The disorganised pattern is frequently met by those working with behaviourally very disturbed children. Perhaps a little confusing at first sight, the disorganised-unresolved classification can be superimposed on one of the three organised attachment patterns of secure, avoidant and ambivalent, whichever 'best fits'. This is meant to suggest that, when the individual is not immediately caught up in their fear and distress, an underpinning 'organised' attachment style operates.

      "abstract": "Problem behavior may be defined as behavior that is socially defined as a problem, a source of concern, or as undesirable by the norms of conventional society and the institutions of adult authority, and its occurrence usually elicits some kind of social control response. Key elements of problem behavior are: (1) problem behaviors are rare until early adolescence; (2) the rate then climbs to a peak level; (3) thereafter the problem behavior becomes less frequent for the remainder of the lifespan (unless it ceases to be seen as a problem behavior), and (4) the timing of these trends is different for different problem behaviors in respects such as the typical age of initiation and the rate and timing of decline. Problem behavior varies with age because of social norms that children be given increasing independelice as they grow older. At each age, tl'ose adolescents who are less closely supervised are more likely to engage in problem behavior. Also relevant to this point is research that time spent socializing with peers in informal settings, away from adult supervision, is related to problem behavior. The question that remains is whether the relationship between independence and problem behavior, combined with the similarity in their age trends, is sufficient to account for age trends in problem behavior.

      "abstract": "Violence against women by their male partners is widespread and infrequently identified as a causal factor in multiple physical and psychological problems of female patients in medical and psychiatric settings. Three main countertransferences that interfere with accurate identification of battered women are described: (1) counter- identification, (2)countertransference rage, and (3) countertransference helplessness. Battering men and battered women are found in all levels of society, although younger, lower income, less-educated men who have observed parental violence in their own home are at higher risk of abusing their spouses. Additionally, antisocial personality disorder, depression, and/or alcohol and drug abuse increase the risk of male violence in the home. Contrary to popular belief, the husband-to-wife violence is usually motivated by his need to control her rather than a result of his loss of control. Battered women show no consistent prebattering risk markers, except for a history of parental violence in their family of origin. Violence against women by their male partners is a serious public health problem that has not been adequately addressed by the medical and psychiatric professions. Myths and clinical realities of battered women are described and detailed recommendations for clinical inquiry and evaluation of level of danger are given.",

Stigma varies along a number of dimensions, including degree of disruptiveness, aesthetic qualities, cause or origin, changes over time, the degree of peril held for others and concealability. The stigma of being identified as 'a criminal' is primarily linked to 'cause' and 'degree of peril' because criminal behaviour is perceived to be controllable and criminals are therefore perceived as blameworthy. Those engaging in criminal behaviour are also often viewed as untrustworthy and a source of potential danger to others. Numerous instances of 'stigma in action' have been studied. For example, substance-misusing offenders may be ostracized not only as a result of their criminal behaviour and 'offender' label but also due to their presumed dependence on mind-altering substances.",

Long-term behavioral responses to invasion of privacy vary, depending on the individual; in relatively powerless and emotionally immature persons, withdrawal and acting out are frequent compensatory mechanisms for lack of privacy. Just as privacy is relative to many other factors, invasions of privacy are similarly often relative to other factors. Invasions of privacy may be random or accidental events, but more typically they are deeply rooted in the situation. Privacy is so relative to other aspects of one's experience, personal development, culture, and physical environment that present-day earth dwellers would be naive to assume that they could accurately anticipate those conditions and those needs. A few problems of privacy that early space inhabitants may encounter are outlined and suggestions are offered for ameliorating these problems.",

Physical aggression and many other forms of antisocial behavior appear during the first few years after birth. Although most learn to regulate them by the time they enter the formal school system, a substantial minority of children do not. This lack of socialization on their part often has important consequences well into adulthood. This chapter will not only review studies of antisocial behaviors globally, but will focus on subtypes of conduct disorder. Indeed, although there may be commonalities between antisocial behaviors, these may not necessarily follow the same developmental course, share the same correlates, or develop jointly. Further, these may be manifested differently in boys and girls. It is only with a better understanding of these developmental factors that we may improve the effectiveness of prevention and corrective interventions.",

Five broad statuses or prototypic styles of resolving the issues of this stage are proposed using combinations of (a) an individual's level of vital involvement, or active concern for the growth of the self and others, and (b) an individual's tolerance of different ideas, traditions, and values, which, by extension, determines the scope of caregiving concern. The Generative status is characterized by high vital involvement and tolerance, and represents the most positive psychosocial outcome. The Pseudogenerative-Agentic status is high in vital involvement and tolerance for self but not for others, while Pseudogenerative-Communal is high in vital involvement and tolerance for others but not for self. The Conventional status, high in vital involvement for both self and others, is low in tolerance across the board. Stagnant reflects the poorest psychosocial outcome, and is low in vital involvement and tolerance generally. A semistructured interview constructed to measure the statuses generated continuous and categorical ratings which were used to investigate inter-rater reliability and validity of the generativity prototypes (N=100). The dimensional scalings obtained higher reliability than the strictly categorical judgements, reaching acceptable levels. Convergence was",

      "abstract": "Team projects call for a blend of task and social skills. Successful completion of a group's task or goal often depends on resolving conflicts between desired task outcomes and volatile interpersonal relationships within groups or teams. Since each member forms unique social relationships with every other member of a group, these relationships may carry over to subsequent groups, as the old group completes its project and disbands. Thus, a trusting relationship between team members becomes the foundation of future cooperative efforts. Some people are so socially maladjusted they can't seem to get along with anyone. Estimates are that as many as 20% of the population have emotional distress that seriously affects their social interactions. Fortunately, most people range from well adjusted to only mildly maladjusted Stable, well-adjusted people fit well into groups, and they typically display various shades of the following four positive traits-agreeableness, assertiveness, consciousness, and openness. However, even mild personality problems can be discouraging and unsettling to others. Distressed people rarely fit well into groups, and they typically display various shades of the following four extreme, or negative traits-passivity, demanding behaviours, rigidity, and distractibility. This study examines the roles played by these stable and extreme traits in building not only trust, but the likelihood an individual would be willing to work with another individual again on a new project.",

Increase and decline of typical behaviors are delayed in children with developmental delays. The relationship between early and later behaviors has not been studied. Although many abnormal behaviors may emerge from typical behaviors in infancy, some behaviors definitely do not. Possibly, the 2nd year is a sensitive period for emergence of abnormal stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors and treatments might be most effective then. Tests of efficacy of treatments to prevent these behaviors are rare.",

      "title": "[Sex education and the problem of early sexual relations among adolescents].",
      "abstract": "Puberty today occurs about 2 years earlier than it did at the beginning of the century. The age of menarche is now usually between 11-13 years, while the establishment of spermatogenesis and appearance of the 1st ejaculation usually occurs between 13-15 years. The ages at which adolescents feel mature, want to behave like adults, and initiate sexual activity are now lower than in the past. Sexual relations may occur between adolescents before they are fully capable of recognizing their consequences as autonomous and responsible acts guided by a system of moral convictions. Both marriage and parenthood may have unfavorable consequences for future personality development, sexual adjustment, and the personal-social adaptation of the individual. In Cuba, the persistence of traces of bourgeois mentality can be seen in the tendency to teach young girls false concepts of female behavior. Traits such as submissiveness, passivity, and fragility are stressed, and girls are taught to inhibit their sexuality from a very young age. Adolescent boys are expected to display virility and machismo. Adolescent boys may be so interested in the physical aspects of sexual activity that they deprecate the aspects, considering them to be weak female traits. Boys are more likely to separate the sexual object and the love object, while such duality is unusual in girls. Among the most serious problems of adolescent sexual activity in Cuba is a high rate of abortions among young adolescents. Some adolescents are promiscuous and have frequent changes of partner. The age group 15-19 years has the 3rd highest rate of syphilis and the 2nd highest of gonorrhea. The proportion of births to minors has increased from 22% in 1973 to almost half in some provinces. Divorce rates have been in constant increase in Cuba, and psychosocial immaturity of very young spouses is a principal factor in divorce. The widening temporal gap between attainment of puberty and marriage, which is likely to be postponed until the completion of ever more time-consuming educations, is a factor in increased premarital sex although it is not a determinant of it. An adequate sex education program would help adolescents develop responsible attitudes and good foundations for their future sexual adjustments. It would also help prevent adolescent pregnancy, with its frequent negative consequences.",

      "abstract": "Disability is commonly viewed as permanent loss of physical, cognitive and social aspects of self. Rehabilitation interventions are aimed to return the individual to full health by either restoration of past physical, cognitive or social capabilities or strengthening aspects of self to counter such loss. However, rehabilitation interventions do not result in a complete return to past physical, mental or social health. Does this mean that people with disability can never be healthy? Or does it indicate that our perception and definition of health does not reflect the essence of health? We argue that when people with disability redefine themselves in terms other than levels of physical, social and cognitive functioning, good health is an attainable goal. We discuss evidence that suggests why spirituality could be a primary determinant of health.",

Health, illness, beliefs, knowledge, and medical practices are all influenced by culture, and dentistry is no exception. Everyone, whether rural or urban, has its own health and illness beliefs and practices. The only way to provide culturally sensitive health care is to be aware of, listen to, and be attentive to each patient, as well as to inquire about personal needs and wishes when appropriate. Spiritual well- being is regarded as the fourth dimension of health. It helps people realize their greatest potential, find meaning and purpose in life, and find fulfillment from within. The individual's lifestyle may have a significant impact on his or her oral health behaviour. Caries and plaque-induced periodontal illnesses are linked to personal hygiene, food intake frequency, motivation to preserve oral health, and in certain circumstances, religious commitment Dental myths are widespread and unquestioned misleading ideas that often arise as a result of a lack of education, spiritual beliefs, and traditional factors based on non-scientific information. Despite global advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, some people continue to hold on to their traditional values, practices, beliefs, and myths. If these myths are exposed in a timely manner, it may be possible to reduce the costs and time required for dental treatment, thereby converting an operative treatment into conservative dental management and improve patient satisfaction.",

The distinction between these two types of condition is often much harder to make when assessing a noncommunicating child than would be expected at first sight. When speech is used qualitative aspects of the production such as the rate of production or the lack of intonation may suggest disordered language functioning. A healthy and secure attachment provides the child with the confidence to explore the environment and tolerate brief separations, whereas a high level of dependency inhibits exploratory behaviour and as a consequence reduces opportunities for learning. The overly dependent infant is perhaps showing early signs of withdrawn behaviour and an avoidance of social interactions. An insensitive approach to dependency weaning at whatever age is often a causal factor in precipitating withdrawn and uncommunicative behaviour.",

      "title": "The adolescent and contraception.",
      "abstract": "Coital activity is often initiated during adolescence, and adolescents, like many adults, do not behave in purely rational ways and frequently fail to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Public attention is focused on adolescent pregnancies because of their increasing number and because the consequences are usually catastrophic. Unplanned pregnancies can have physical, psychosocial, and prenatal effects. It is important from both the individual and societal perspective that high priority be given to the task of preventing adolescent pregnancy. The health care provider, to gain the trust of the adolescent, must be open, honest, and willing to consider the young person's feelings and motivations. In addition to historical data and physical examination, the choice of a contraceptive method is based on individual preferences involving personal, familial, religious, and societal beliefs as well as sexual practice. A decision involving birth control for the adolescent can be complicated by parental influence and involvement. The teenage years are frequently a time of embarrassment about the physical maturation and biological functioning of the body. Birth control methods which require a person to touch himself/herself or to be used at the time of sexual intercourse may be unacceptable to the teenager. Fertility awareness techniques, such as basal body temperature, rhythm, and cervical mucus methods are inexpensive but call for a high degree of personal motivation. The use of a diaphragm requires an office visit and a pelvic examination for fitting and prescription. Contraceptive foam, suppositories, and condoms can be easily obtained over-the-counter for a minimal cost, and a moderate degree of personal motivation is needed for their effective use. Though effective, abortions should not be recommended indiscriminately. Permanent contraceptive methods are not recommended for the adolescent. The IUD and oral contraceptives (OCs) are recommended for adolescents who are unwilling to touch themselves or who desire a birth control method which can be used apart from the act of sexual intercourse. Both are highly effective, but there are important factors to consider in their prescription. Both methods require an initial office visit and pelvic examination and an additional procedure for the insertion of the IUD. Follow-up visits are essential and a prescription is necessary for the OCs. Cost can be prohibitive for the adolescent. Both have possible side effects contributing to mild to major discomfort.",

India is a home to almost 19% of world’s children. More than one third of the country population around 440 million is below 18 years However in India, which has the largest number of child population in the world, nearly 40% of the its population 69% of Indian children are victims of child abuse .According to WHO: ‘’Child abuse or maltreatment Constitutes all forms of physical and/or emo- tional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent Treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child’s health . Child abuse includes, physical violence 75%, sex- ual molestation 20%, mental and emotional 5%, maltreatment with negligence, deprivation and lack of opportunity . A recently conducted survey revealed shocking facts pertaining to child abuse in India. More than 53% su ered with sexual abuse, while 54% with physical and 48% with emotional abuse at the hands of par- ents and family members. Sexual abuse is one of the most devastat- ing type of child maltreatment and estimates that it has increased significantly during past decade. According to a 2007 survey sponsored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development over 53% of the children have been sexually abused . Children between 5 and 12 years old are the most vulnerable age group and boys out number girls with 52.94% reporting abuse. In February 2011, the times of India re- ported that every 2.5 hours a child below 16 years of age and every 13 hours a child below 10 years of age is raped in India making it the country with the highest number of child sexual abuse of any country. The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males according to a 2009 study pub- lished in Clinical Psychology .According to the study done by Chithra M (2011), regarding mothers knowledge regarding child abuse re- vealed that majority of mothers (82%) have inadequate knowledge child abuse. The mother is the primary care giver for the child hence has a major role to play in this arena. This prompted the researcher to undertake this study focusing on mothers. Language: en",

      "abstract": "The human health results from the interplay of lifestyle, genetic, psychological, and other factors. In addition, humans are exposed to numerous environmental factors that affect their physical and mental health. In the present piece of work, the impact of environmental exposure on mental and physical health is understood in the broadest sense. The environment has direct and indirect effects on mental and physical health. High-rise housing and other constructions are detrimental to the psychological wellbeing of people. Residential overcrowding, these high-density areas, and noisy exterior noise sources increase psychological distress and may contribute to the development of mental and physical disorders. Air pollutants with a pungent odor amplify negative effects, and environmental pollutants have also been linked to behavioral disturbances. Lack of adequate daylight is reliably associated with melancholic dispositions and increased depressive symptoms. Consequently, environmental factors continue to negatively impact both mental and physical health. The environment has the potential to encourage or inhibit human interaction. Along with this, individuals’ personal control, social support, relationships, and restoration from tension and fatigue may all be affected by various aspects and properties of the built environment. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when work from home had become commonplace, environmental factors had a significant impact on the health outcomes of individuals. Hence, this article is trying to shed light on the environmental factors that affect the physical and mental health of its users in more than one way and what can be done to make it less stressful, safer, and better by improving the tangible environment.",

The adolescent is a marginal person who is no longer accorded the privileged status of the child, nor as yet many of the rights and responsibilities of the adult. The relatively low degree of institutionalization of adolescence as a status position and the marginal position of the adolescent in terms of role expectations in American society are reflected in the fact that most of the norms governing adolescent behavior do not have adolescent behavior patterns as their reference point. Rather, the norms and expectations governing adolescent behavior have either child or adult behavior patterns as their reference point. The exhortations of parents and other adults admonish the adolescent either to like a grown-up or to quit behaving like a child.. They rarely encourage him to like an adolescent. There are, then, no highly institutionalized expectations of how one is to behave like an adolescent, in the sense that achievement of these status expectations is a positive transitional link with the adult status.",

It has been increasingly recognized that the dental surgeon may be the first professional to suspect physical abuse, especially in relation to injuries involving the orofacial structures.3 A child is considered to have been abused if he or she is treated in a way that is unacceptable in a given culture at a given time.4 For the purposes of this review, only physical abuse in the form of NAI and neglect will be considered. Neglect occurs when an adult knowingly allows a child to endure pain or suffering or fails to provide the basic requisites for proper maturation.",

Kriminalität im Alter kann sich u. a. als – oftmals durch geringe Schwere gekennzeichnete – Alltagsdelinquenz darstellen, aber auch als \"Weiße Kragen-Kriminalität\" (White-Collar Crime) Älterer oder als delinquentes und gewaltförmiges Verhalten vor dem Hintergrund alterskorrelierter gesundheitlicher und kognitiver Einschränkungen.

      "title": "Predicting and preventing youth violence: understanding and disrupting developmental trajectories and risk",
      "abstract": "The relationship between age and crime is well known and has been documented throughout history. Although different types of offenses tend to peak at different ages, violent and delinquent behaviour typically increase during adolescence and the early years of adulthood, and taper off with advancing age. There also appears to be little specialisation in the types of offenses committed by young people. Young people generally commit a variety of violent and non-violent offenses. In recent years, researchers have begun to explore whether violent and delinquent behaviour in adolescence and young adulthood is part of a general pattern of antisocial and aggressive behaviour that emerges during childhood or whether it is the result of certain personal, situational and environmental factors. Some children, for example, exhibit stubborn, defiant, and disobedient behaviour at very young ages, and progress to mild and eventually more severe forms of aggressive and delinquent behaviour by adolescence and young adulthood. Other children either do not exhibit serious problem behaviour until they reach adolescence or seem to outgrow aggressive behaviour by the time they enter primary school. For violence prevention purposes, it is important to know the extent to which patterns of aggressive and antisocial behaviour in childhood are predictive of violent and delinquent behaviour at later ages and also to know which factors increase or buffer the risk for violent and delinquent behaviours at different ages. Understanding this continuity or change in behaviour during different developmental periods is important for identifying appropriate points for intervention. The purpose of this presentation is, thus, threefold: (1) to describe the developmental pathways of aggressive, violent and delinquent behaviour, (2) to describe the factors that increase or buffer against the risk for violent and delinquent behaviour at different ages and across developmental periods and (3) to discuss the implications of the different patterns of behaviour and risk for designing preventive interventions.",

      "title": "The Universality of Emotional Child Abuse.",
      "abstract": "Emotional child abuse is virtually inevitable in the context of the traditional nuclear family and often has a more detrimental effect on children than other, more widely publicized forms of maltreatment. Clinical, statistical, and empirical evidence shows that normative child-rearing practices in Western culture have pathogenic properties and effects. Parental abuse in the traditional nuclear family often results in the personal suffering, limitation, and maladjustment of children. Manifestations of this abuse include: (1) behavior based on parental hostility such as verbal abuse, sadistic socialization, and lack of respect for a child's boundaries, spontaneity, and individuality; (2) destructive practices including permissiveness and inconsistency; (3) overly restrictive or harsh moral codes; and (4) defenses and addictive patterns which tend to transmit from parents to children. A number of factors are involved in the psychodynamics of emotional maltreatment: (1) parents' ambivalent feelings toward themselves and their children; (2) their projection of their negative traits Onto their children; (3) a confusion of emotional hunger with love; (4) the exclusivity of traditional couplings; and (5) the utilization of the child as a symbol of immortality. The more parents were deprived or abused during their formative years, the greater the impairment of their parental functions. The nuclear family is not inherently detrimental to human mental health, but it has evolved into a destructive institution. Only by dealing with the issues that make families dysfunctional can family life be made more supportive and constructive for children. (Contains 118 references.)

      "abstract": "Although stress, defined as the deterioration in homeostatic mechanisms in living things due to psychological, physiological, social, and even environmental reasons, has been mentioned since the 17th century, it is frequently encountered in modern life. So much so that you can be exposed to stress anytime, from home, business life, to the street, in traffic. This situation has made stress a part of modern life. Any situation or event, such as losing a close person, workplace stress, or even living in isolation at home during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, can also be a source of stress. Responses that occur in the organism to the stress stimulus are for the benefit of the organism up to a certain level. However, when the duration and intensity of the stress stimulus increase, pathological conditions occur in all physiological systems. Long-term exposure to stress may cause infertility in men by causing decreases in sperm parameters such as sperm quality, sperm concentration, spermatozoid count, and sperm percentage. Various substances are being researched to reduce these adverse effects of stress on the reproductive system. Studies have shown that melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and so on. It shows positive efficacy in male infertility with various mechanisms. This review it is aimed to give information on the effect of stress on the male reproductive system and the relationship between melatonin.",

      "title": "Understanding the Delinquent Behavior: A Step towards Reformation",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONDelinquency can be well described in a few words as a misdemeanor or an aberration from the social acceptable norms by a group of individuals who are in the middle or late adolescence. The majority vehemently reacts to these traits and sets out to punish them by incarcerating them and placing them in correctional institution to be corrected for their deviance. This treatment applies to all the children of this age group be it developed or any undeveloped nation in the world.There may be a number of factors responsible for juvenile delinquency in India. The first factor which might spur delinquent behaviour is an unfavorable family environment, including weakening of family ties, disruption of previous relationship, or the breakdown of consensus and loyalty. Besides, in present time juveniles are having access to modern gadgets and technologies. Their anticipations and aspirations from society are also very high. Unsatisfied needs and failure to reach goals lead them to deviate and get entrapped in various unwanted, antisocial activities. Lack of positive role models, and peer pressure further stand as strong reasons for their turning away from the standard norm.Another emerging issue is that of the migrants which becomes pronounced with the growth of industries and the spread of urbanization this floating sample is alienated with its existing environment. Children of these migrant families rootless and with identity crisis have their own set of ideas. Desires and life styles.. Peer pressure strengthens the feeling in the boy that he is not alone enabling him to do that which he never thought of doing it otherwise. The difference between the right and wrong gets diffused. In many instances when they realize their mistakes they are filled with remorse and look towards a new guidance.Juveniles in conflict with the law are therefore the unfortunate lot who due to one reason or more failed to adjust with the social mainstream and adopted a life style which made them deviants, and they ended up as offenders. Had they received proper attention at the appropriate time from their families and the social environment they could have joined their more fortunate peers in the mainstream for a purposeful, constructive and fulfilling life.This particular study is based on the boys residing in the Observation home known as Sewa Kuthir, at Kinsway Camp, New Delhi, remains the subject of concern for all including the members of the JJBoard, social welfare department and the family who eagerly wait for their return back to their hearth. They can be left to themselves till their release without repenting for their misdemeanor only to come back again with further hostility and aggression towards ones own self and towards others. To avoid such a situation efforts are made to transform their personality and create in them the sense of guilt and remorse. Life Skill program was specifically tailor made for these boys living in Kinsway Camp and Majnu ka Tila, followed by other intervention activities.To assess that the juveniles were instilling new ideas and skills and were sensitized appropriately a pre and post tests were administered. Boys were observed by the experts to assess the impact of the Life Skill on them. Two standardized scales were used one is Criminal Propensity Scale and the other was Morality Scale.AIM OF THE STUDYThe aim of this short study is to assess whether the boys who have been exposed to life skill classes have really undergone a change and felt the impact of the modules.HYPOTHESIS* Those boys found statistically high on criminal propensity and low on morality were not safe to be released and need to undertake the life skill program* Those boys found low on Criminal propensity and high on morality were safe when they were in the society and were not likely to repeat any offence.* Boys in the moderate level with medium criminal tendencies and moderate moral values were receptive to changeMETHODOLOGYSampleInitially a list of 40 boys was prepared for the study but it was regularly modified because of the release of some of the boys. …",

      "abstract": "Piaget (16), using the clinical method, investigated the development of moral judgment in children. On the basis of these investigations, he concluded that there were two types of in the child. The first stage, referred to as of constraint, exists until the age of 7 or 8 years. During this period adults are viewed as omnipotent, and obedience is automatic without reasoning or judgment. Punishment is regarded as a necessary retribution of justice to restore the status quo and is given in proportion to the size of the misdeed, independent of motive. The more mature type of morality, which begins at about the age of Io, is the stage of morality of or reciprocity, highlighted by cooperation and mutual respect. Conscience has become more autonomous and the child evaluates intentions, rather than deeds alone. Punishment no longer needs to be fair and retributive. Piaget relates the emergence of this stage to the child's increased ability to differentiate between subject and object, to a more rational conception of authority, and thus to his liberation from the thought and will of others. An intermediary stage in which the child internalizes rules without evaluating them was noted by Piaget in the 8- to Io-year-old group.",

The deficit or distortion of these developmental conditions blocks the satisfaction of the needs of the adolescent's personality, which are the source of sociogenesis. The most vulnerable in the development process are adolescents with developmental disabilities, which is associated with the specifics of the socio-biological conditions in which they grow up. Disorders sensory (visual or hearing), motor or mental spheres in adolescents with disabilities, as well as the specifics of the social situation of their development lead to difficulties in communication, expression of emotions, lower levels of self-control, possession of verbal and nonverbal communication in adolescents of this group. Deprivation or delay in the development of social needs in adolescence can lead to frustration, impoverish the conditions for the development of the individual as a whole. Solving the experimental task of identifying the main social needs of adolescents with developmental disabilities in three different groups (mentally retarded, visually impaired, and hard of hearing) in comparison with normatively developing adolescents, we assume that they will differ in their specificity and severity.",

Social perspectives of disability are different, to bring them right path to social inclusion. Disability theories recognize disability as a structural of functional incapability and considered as the nucleus of disability issues. The basic questions about disability experience merely around to functional disabilities. The experience and life of persons with disabilities vary with the life experience they have and the exotic life experience of person with disabilities are more relevant to specific research approaches to explore social mind in disability . Human state is temporarily or permanently leads to disability. Human conditions of poverty, malnutrition, birth disorders, accidents, old age, psychological disorders, natural calamities, war, acid attacks, clinical trials, innovations, tech-addiction, alcoholism, suicide attempt, communicable and non-communicable diseases increasing the life experiences of persons and lead to disability. Life experience of disabled and social mind in disability ultimately leads to social change; increasing number of accidents and increasing number of old age people. The main issue related with disability is the social (community) inclusion of disabled population, inclusive growth and how best to include and support people with disabilities in the political, social and economic realm of development in the modern world. The concept and attitude of society towards disability have changed since the 1970â€™s, growing tendency to see disability as a human right issue, once people with disabilities segregated from community to special schools and residential institutions and now the change is visible from community exclusion to the best integrated social inclusion and community participation .",

There are indications that extraversion, conscientiousness and openness show reduced levels in later life, but people’s rank order on personality traits remains stable. Development continues into later life, but builds on earlier experiences and ways of coping. Personality resources such as self-esteem, perceived control, self-efficacy and resilience shape the person’s response to adversity in later life, enabling older people to maintain high levels of well-being, despite the challenges. Dementia, the ultimate challenge, is accompanied by personality change, with raised neuroticism and lowered conscientiousness both predicting its onset and accompanying its course.

      "abstract": "Violence is not uncommon in the contemporary world. The consequences of harmful experiences in childhood are often educational problems, difficult behavior, failure to cope in adulthood, duplication of learned, negative behavior patterns and disorders in various spheres/areas of life. The experience of childhood violence is associated with the occurrence of about half of mental disorders with onset in childhood and one third of disorders that appear later in life. Various emotional and behavioral disorders are mentioned among the psychological effects of violence against a child, including depressive disorders. Regarding experiences of violence, there is strong evidence that exposure to sexual or physical violence is a predictor of depressive episodes and depressive symptoms in adolescents. Among adolescents, the impact of violence on depression has been shown to be sustained. Accordingly, evidence suggests that elevated depressive symptoms and episodes of depression may even persist for up to two years after experiencing cases of violence. Due to the destructive consequences of such behavior, international and national law devote much attention to the protection of children's rights. Under Polish law, there are regulations describing measures of reaction within the family, as well as provisions sanctioning violent behavior. Therefore, the study discusses the family and criminal law aspects of violence against minors. The whole study is imbued with considerations of the so-called the obligation to denounce, i.e., to notify about the disclosure of a prohibited act committed to the detriment of minors. This issue was presented in the context of medical secrets and its type-psychiatric discretion.",

The degree of inclination and the extent of engagement in the act though will depend on the individual's society, his/her culture, upbringing, religious beliefs/taboos, other people's expectation and opportunities [2]. What constitutes a normal sexual behaviour? There is no straightforward answer. What may be normal in one culture/society may be abnormal in another. The definition of 'normalcy' is driven by society and/or cultural values, and the extent of 'deviance' is also influenced by the same. Furthermore the 'degree of deviance' in some sexual behaviours can be quantified by comparing with already established norms, but this is not possible for all sex-related behaviours and conditions [3].",

Often they have suffered a chronic illness in childhood or adolescence, and have not had sufficient satisfaction or have had too much satisfaction in the oral period. Responding to excessive frustration or to excessive satisfaction in childhood, they have developed a passive oral character, which often leads to weakness of character and tendency to alcoholism. The patterns of protector figures that have introjected will lead them to the choice of protector pairs and to the dependence on any protective figure, rather than to the choice of specific attachment figures. The need to distinguish themselves from others creates some uncertainty and anxiety to them and they show difficulty in securing personal identity. They show anxiety in the process of differentiation and they live the differentiation as a loss. They feel anxious when alone and euphoric in the company of protective figures. They live anchored in the dilemma of complete dependence or complete independence, without middle ground of more or less dependence. By failing to develop an autonomous personality, they are undecided, conformist and uncritical to the protective figures. They are more oriented towards the needs and desires of the people they love than towards their own needs. They are vulnerable to criticism from others and they are fear of failure. Their personality is characterized by a lack of self esteem, confidence and assertiveness, and the need for affection and the self-contempt. They are humble, kind, loyal, viscous, friendly and generous. They often develop psychosomatic disorders. Both the dependent and the avoidant personality have lack of security and fear of criticism. The avoidant is in great need of protection and affection, but usually does not trust others. The dependent, however, trust others. The avoidant keeps away from others and is isolated from others predicting exclusion. The dependent, however, fears being alone, trust others and seeks their protection. The therapist should set clear goals for patients with dependent personality, because they must go leaving the feeling of futility, as they achieve these goals. But the dependent personality always looks suspiciously the therapeutic advances that will lead him to independence. The therapist must teach behavioral skills and make decisions. The others must share their doubts with him. Objectives: Assess “Alexithymia” as a variable in patients with dysthymia. Material and Methods: Alexithymia Toronto Scale 20-items (TAS-20) and Zung`s Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) applied to 30 subjects. Mean (X), standard deviation (SD), positive cases percentage (%), Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, t-Student test accepting p ). Depression in dysthymic disorders and alexithymia showed a positive lineal correlation, r=+0.62. Conclusions: Dysthymia shows increased alexithymia.",

      "title": "S10: Ageism in intersection: Ensuring the human rights of older persons in the face of oppressions",
      "abstract": "Summary: Ageism is defined as prejudice, discrimination, and stereotypes towards people because of their age. Ageism can be directed towards individuals of all ages and be either positive or negative. Ageism can operate at the institutional level directed via legal and social policies, at the meso level as evident in interpersonal relations and at the micro level directed by people towards their own age and aging. Ageism can be experienced either consciously with full awareness or unconsciously, without the agent of ageism and/or the target of ageism being fully aware of it. The following presentations will address ageism in relation to older persons because of its well- known detrimental effects. An important aspect of ageism concerns the fact that it does not occur in silo. Instead, it is often age in intersection with other forms of discrimination, which results in the marginalization of older persons. Perel-Levin will analyse how ageism and age-based discrimination intersect with other forms of biases, discrimination, and inequalities based, such as disability, gender, gender identity and sexual orientation, ethnic background, and socioeconomic status. The presentation by Daichman will focus on age in intersection with gender by stressing the vulnerable place of older women and relate this to elder abuse. Ayalon will highlight self- directed ageism and intergenerational conflict as they manifest in older persons’ political activism. Finally, Rabheru will discuss findings concerning ageism in Canada based on data obtained from a diverse array of stakeholders, including researchers, healthcare professionals, social service providers, older persons, and advocates. Kalache will moderate the session and conclude with applied tools to ensure the human rights of older persons in the face of institutional, interactional, and intrapersonalageism.",

Nothing in the acceptance of heredity as a factor in the genesis of any condition considered by this Report excludes the environmental agencies of life as equally potent and, in many instances, as even more effective.Sterilization can only be recom- mended in selected cases of certain diseases and with the consent of the patient or those responsible for him.It may be considered in Huntington's chorea, feeblemindedness of familial type, schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychosis, and epilepsy.It is to be stressed that no great or radical change in the complexion of society can thus be expected.C.

The chance of negative psychosocial and mental health effects associated with child sexual abuse is unquestionably increased, but even stability processes identified a number of protective factors, including as family support. The perpetrators of this crime take advantage of their position of vulnerability, trust, and power in order to commit child sexual abuse or attempt to do so for financial gain or other purposes. Given how similar the terms “child sexual exploitation” and “child sexual abuse” are, it can be challenging to distinguish between them. Children who experience child sexual abuse suffer grave consequences. It serves as a huge roadblock to growth and advancement. Many health behaviours brought on by child sexual abuse result in negative mental, physical, and social outcomes throughout life. There are numerous circumstances that can contribute to child sexual abuse.",

      "title": "Promoting Young People's Sexual and Reproductive Health: Stigma, Discrimination and Human Rights.",
      "abstract": "All over the world young people are stigmatised and discriminated against in relation to their sexual and reproductive health. Stigma discrimination and the violation of human rights are intimately connected reinforcing and legitimising each other. Their manifestations are varied occurring in families and communities in health services at places of work and in schools. Across a range of settings young people may be stigmatised and discriminated against for being sexually active before marriage or for engaging in forms of sexuality which are considered by their communities and wider society to be non-normative such as homosexual or transgendered practices. In addition in settings where premarital sexual activity among young people is stigmatised the signs of unprotected sexual activity such as unplanned pregnancy having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or being HIV-positive may themselves be highly stigmatised. This may seriously limit access to good quality sexual and reproductive health services. This stigmatisation of young people’s sexuality and sexual behaviour has serious consequences. In particular it can lead to young people feeling that they have to conceal their sexual activity from significant adults in their lives including parents teachers and health workers. The secrecy and shame that stigma often brings can deny young people access to the resources they need in order to make and implement informed decisions about their sexuality and sexual health. Where resources are available - or inappropriately framed - they may be inadequate to address young people’s needs. (excerpt)",

      "title": "Academic Anxiety and Wellbeing Amongst Rural and Urban Adolescents",
      "abstract": "The term is a social construct, like other developmental phases in human growth and development, but unlike others, it breeds a lot of ambiguity. However, some experts view the term as a construct applied by adult members of the society to describe the person who is in the transition to acquire biological features peculiar to the adult population group. The term is derived from the Latin word meaning to grow up' or 'to grow into maturity'. Adolescence begins with the onset of physiologically normal puberty, and ends when an adult identity and behavior are accepted. This period of development corresponds roughly to the period between the ages of 10 and 19 years, which is consistent with the World Health Organization's definition of adolescence.This imprecision in ages corresponding to adolescence reflects society's treatment of the period. Adolescents are no longer considered children, but not yet adults. Clearly, though, adolescence is the time of considerable physical and psychological growth and change. It is a time of emotional turmoil, mood swings, gloomy introspection, great drama and heightened sensitivity. It is a time of rebellion and behavioral experimentation.Cognitive, emotional, attitudinal and behavioral changes which are the characteristics of adolescence, often take place during this stage, and this can be a cause of conflict on one hand and on the other hand it can have a positive impact on personality development.Hence proper guidance at this crucial phase in life is all the more important for enhancing their self concept, self esteem and self confidence, enhancing their knowledge and skills in decision making, conflict resolution and management of emotions. The changing cognitive capacity of adolescents which allows for increased abstract reasoning often implies that an adolescent develops skills that enable her to cope with complex issues. Such issues can be, for instance, an ever increasing independence from parents, forming intimate relationships and focusing on career plans.In this age of industrialization and technological development, the concept of anxiety is considered to be an important factor in psychology. Every alert citizen of our society realizes on the basis of his own experience as well as his observation of his fellowmen that anxiety is a pervasive and profound phenomenon in this era. It is a characteristic which could be found in all cultures in varying degrees. It has become an essential part of modem living and seems to permeate all spheres of life. Especially vulnerable to this problem are the adolescents who are living in an increasingly anxiety ridden atmosphere. They live in a world where nothing seems to be guaranteed with certainty and at the same time they are expected to perform at every front, the main being the academics. Adolescents often lack in academic motivation and performance, as their attention is divided among a lot many things especially at creating an identity for themselves. Once out of elementary school, they find their teachers, parents, and peers putting a new emphasis on deadlines, academics and mastering of large amounts of information.Academic anxietyAnxiety is one of the most common psychological disorders in school-aged children and adolescents worldwide. Anxiety is a physiological and psychological state characterized by cognitive, somatic, emotional and behavioral components.Anxiety in general is described as an uncomfortable feeling of nervousness, worry and tension, which everyone feels from time to time. School and examinations are an inevitable aspect of most children's lives in today's world in which academic stress and test anxiety are ubiquitous problems (Deb, Chatteijee & Walsh, 2010; Yildirim, Ergene & Munir, 2007).Anxiety is associated with substantial negative effects on children's social, emotional and academic success (McLoone, Hudson & Rapee. 2006). Specific effects include poor social and coping skills, often leading to avoidance of social interactions (Albano, Chorpita & Barlow, 2003; Weeks, Coplan & Kingsbury, 2009), loneliness, low self-esteem, perceptions of social rejection, and difficulty forming friendships (Bokhorst, Goossens & DeRuyter, 2001 ). …",

      "abstract": "Viene mostrato come l'ostacolo a taluni strumenti suicidari non porti necessariamente a spostarsi su altre modalità letali, esaminando in particolare il caso dell'intossicazione da gas domestico in Gran Bretagna e gli ostacoli per prevenire il salto dal Golden Gate Bridge di San Francisco. Il mancato spostamento sembra caratterizzare anche altri aspetti patologici, quali il gioco d'azzardo, le dipendenze o la criminalità. L'ipotesi dello spostamento è in realtà legata all'errore fondamentale di attribuzione, che privilegia gli aspetti disposizionali rispetto a quelli situazionali. Vengono esaminati bias collegati a questo errore di attribuzione, come la mancata stabilità e coerenza nel tempo e nelle diverse situazioni degli aspetti disposizionali, la mancata coerenza tra atteggiamenti e comportamenti, e gli errori che gli approcci disposizionali inducono nella previsione di compor-tamenti con il variare delle situazioni. Questi bias mettono in discussione il concetto tradizionale di personalità e il suo ruolo nella genesi dei sintomi o nella predizione dei comportamenti, e anche i modelli psicologici tradizionali che prevedono che i comportamenti siano sempre conseguenza degli atteggiamenti della persona. Il ruolo degli aspetti situazionali, specialmente dei cosiddetti \"fattori canale\", appare importante nella modifica di comportamenti in ambito preventivo e tera-peutico.",

      "abstract": "The paradigmatic system of societal abuse occurs in totalitarian state systems. The relational systems of subjugation that maintain such states of terror must, of necessity, destroy any authentic civic space in which individuals can flourish. Similar dynamics characterize child abuse within families. Survival requires the use of varied strategies, the most extreme of which are dissociative in nature, and that result in marked distortions of developmental trajectories across all psychological domains. Such dynamics are mirrored in dissociative systems that, in the absence of intervention, perpetuate the trauma of non-recognition by subjugation and self-objectification, or by omnipotent denial of others' subjectivity. All abusive systems are facilitated by bystanders, whose awareness of what is disavowed is always partial, resulting in a state of knowing and not-knowing. As dynamics shift, bystanders may behave like victims—passive, helpless, frightened and frozen, or like perpetrators—taking vicarious and voyeuristic pleasure in abuse or actively aiding and abetting the abusers.",

      "title": "On the Preservation of Health",
      "abstract": "HEALTH IS INTRINSICALLY UNSTABLE AND IS SUBJECT to erosive forces across the life trajectory, from intrauterine life to old age. As a result, few individuals achieve idealized versions of the lifespan (ie, good health and functional status into very advanced years, with compression of morbidity toward the end of life). Each person may be thought of as having, at birth, a certain quantum of health expectancy, determined by the characteristics of the individual genome and the biological quality of the intrauterine environment in which the fetus has developed. The quantum is affected over time as the biological, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics of the individual interact with environmental, socioeconomic, and educational factors, and with the amount and quality of the health care received over the life course. Programs aimed at reduction of risk through health promotion at the individual or population level have been effective to some degree, but such efforts are frequently post hoc in nature, addressing secondary or tertiary prevention needs. In addition, these efforts are disarticulated across the lifespan, with childhood and adolescent clinical and public health interventions discontinuous from those in the adult years. Furthermore, the latter often focus on behavioral and environmental health risks only after they have been unaddressed for long periods, with incipient, clinically silent disease already established. In fact, risk exposures tend to increase in number, chronicity, and cumulative importance over the life trajectory, resulting in gradual erosion of health status and of future health prospects. A more consistent effort organized around health preservation as a framing paradigm, instituted early in life, and addressed to mitigating risk factors through a more syncytial and coherent life course approach is suggested by a number of factors. First, health risks are present throughout the life course and vary in nature over time, from intrauterine life to old age. Second, many clinical disorders that manifest in adult life represent late stages of long-standing occult disease, suggesting that earlier, even lifelong, application of preventive or moderating efforts might be more effective. Third, increasing evidence suggests that important causes of morbidity in adult life have their origins very early and, in some instances, may be to a significant degree determined before birth or neonatally. Fourth, healthrelated behaviors are acquired in more or less staccato fashion over the lifespan, and once-acquired, health-adverse behaviors are often difficult to disestablish, such as eating and physical activity patterns acquired in childhood, initiation of tobacco use, or exposure to illicit drugs in adolescence. Despite an increase in life expectancy at birth of approximately 30 years during the past century in the United States, most individuals are subject to gradual impairment of health. These impairments often become overt in the middle years of life; chronic diseases are the most common proximate causes. With advancing age, the occurrence and continuation of chronic disease is common; 80% of communitydwelling US individuals older than 65 years have at least 1 identified chronic disease and 48% have 3 or more chronic diseases. The disorders that represent the chief causes of death largely reflect longstanding risk factors and many are characterized by long clinical latency and progress silently often for years before becoming clinically apparent. To a considerable extent, these disorders reflect the effect of healthadverse personal behaviors that are responsible for an estimated 40% of deaths in the United States. The health effects of many of the major risk factors are avoidable or reversible to substantial degrees. Realization of the targets established in the most recent Healthy People 2010 report is estimated to potentially increase healthy life expectancy by 5.8 to 8.1 years. Studies among the Seventh Day Adventist population have suggested that optimal healthrelated personal behaviors could add 10 years to average life expectancy. Other studies indicate sharp reductions in health risk with cessation of smoking and with the adoption of regular exercise patterns, even in old age. Appropriate clinical interventions in disease management have also been associated with improved health outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, depression, low birth weight, cataracts, and breast cancer. Mitigation of social and economic factors that adversely impact health presents a more complex set of issues. Many of these factors are related to public policy, such as the availability of adequate housing, the nature and comprehensiveness of health insurance programs, remediation of toxic environments, and efforts to reduce poverty and thereby its health impacts.",

      "title": "Grievances, Individual and Mobilizing",
      "abstract": "When individuals collectively challenge authorities via social movements, they typically do so over matters about which they are deeply troubled, have considerable concern, and feel passionately. These troublesome matters or conditions, and the feelings associated with them – such as dissatisfaction, fear, indignation, resentment, and moral shock – can be thought of as grievances. They provide the primary motivational impetus for organizing social movement campaigns and for engaging in social movement activities. Although there are various sets of conditions that contribute to the emergence and operation of social movements – such as some degree of perceived political opportunity, organization, and resource acquisition, none of these factors is more important than the generation of mobilizing grievances. After all, it is difficult to imagine most individuals engaging in social movement activity without feeling deeply aggrieved about some condition that is regarded as contrary to the interests, rights, moral principles, or wellbeing of themselves or others. Consider the adherents of the pro‐choice and pro‐life movements, and of those advocating for and against same‐sex marriages in the United States or immigration and tighter border control throughout much of the developed world. Not only are the adherents of one movement deeply aggrieved by the prospect of the other movement achieving its goals, but their passions about their movement are often palpable and thus worn, metaphorically, on their sleeves. Certainly, other motivational factors – such as curiosity, the desire for approval, and peer pressure – may come into play when considering why people align themselves with a particular movement, but these usually are secondary and largely irrelevant in the absence of deeply felt grievances.",

Ageing is a progressive decline in function and performance, which accompanies advancing years. Cicero noticed that the old people preserved their intellects if they maintained their interests. To the social, economical and medical problems that old age arises to the society, one may add the continue increase of old people proportion in the general population. The ageing of population is becoming a reality in developed and in less developed countries too. We talk about a conceptual definition of normal ageing and also about successful and morbid ageing. Normal ageing is an ageing process without any clinical somatic or mental disorder and a morbid ageing is characterized by a process presenting clinical disorders which affects the somatic and mental health, the successful ageing being an ageing process in a favourable environmental conditions to promote individual development. We can consider not only the presence/absence of a disorder but also its impact in someone's life. The functioning capacity loss could be considered as a marker of the presence of a clinical disorder. Stigma remains a major obstacle to ensuring access to good care for elderly with mental disorders, these patients suffers of a double jeopardy (old age and mental disorders). Both stigma and discrimination against these old persons depend on the type of mental disorder and we have to protect them against discrimination and improve their quality of life.",

In fact it is unlikely that the individual undergoes greater changes at any other stage in the life-cycle apart from infancy.

Of all the theories of adolescence it is evident that the psychoanalytic and sociological approaches have had the widest impact. However the two are clearly different from each other. The psychoanalytic view takes as its starting point the upsurge of instincts which is said to occur as a result of puberty. Puberty, and the physical growth that accompanies it, is important to those involved in education for a number of reasons. Changes in intellectual functioning during the teenage years have implications for a wide range of behaviours and attitudes.",

Prior to the nineteenth century, very little was written on the subject of child maltreatment. The legal and philosophical definitions of child abuse and neglect are fairly similar. In both legal and philosophical contexts, child abuse is generally defined as physical, emotional, or sexual harm done to a child. Abuse generally denotes the active harming of a child. On the other hand, child neglect is an act of omission in which a parent, guardian, or other individual responsible for a child's well‐being has failed to provide some predefined notion of adequate care. In large part, the definitions of child abuse and child neglect depend upon what types of treatment children are entitled to receive. Writers on children's rights have proposed a wide array of answers to the question of what children are owed. These answers range from defining a minimum standard of care that must be met to arguing for a fairly demanding maximizing standard.",

      "title": "Eighteen‐Month‐Old Infants Correct Non‐Conforming Actions by Others",
      "abstract": "At around their third birthday, children begin to enforce social norms on others impersonally, often using generic normative language, but little is known about the developmental building blocks of this abstract norm understanding. Here, we investigate whether even toddlers show signs of enforcing on others interpersonally how “we” do things. In an initial dyad, 18‐month‐old infants learnt a simple game‐like action from an adult. In two experiments, the adult either engaged infants in a normative interactive activity (stressing that this is the way “we” do it) or, as a non‐normative control, marked the same action as idiosyncratic, based on individual preference. In a test dyad, infants had the opportunity to spontaneously intervene when a puppet partner performed an alternative action. Infants intervened, corrected, and directed the puppet more in the normative than in the non‐normative conditions. These findings suggest that, during the second year of life, infants develop second‐personal normative expectations about their partner's behavior (“You should do X!”) in social interactions, thus making an important step toward understanding the normative structure of human cultural activities. These simple normative expectations will later be scaled up to group‐minded and abstract social norms.",

      "abstract": "Ray Bachtian Rangkuti (* Nurmalawaty (** Mohammad Ekaputra (*** Hukum positif di Indonesia tidak memandang semua hubungan kelamin diluar perkawinan sebagai zina (overspel). Perbuatan zina menurut KUHP hanya meliputi mereka yang melakukan persetubuhan atas dasar suka sama suka tanpa ada unsur paksaan, kekerasan dan ancaman kekerasan, KUHP juga memandang ada suatu perbuatan yang melakukan persetubuhan dengan daya paksa, kekerasan, atau ancaman kekerasan, yaitu delik pemerkosaan, Tindak pidana pemerkosaan ironisnya tidak hanya berlangsung di lingkungan luar atau tempat-tempat tertentu yang memberikan peluang manusia berlainan jenis dapat berkomunikasi, namun juga dapat terjadi di lingkungan sekitar yang seharusnya menjadi tempat memperoleh perlindungan. Pada hakikatnya korban tidak dapat melindungi diri sendiri dari berbagai macam tindakan yang menimbulkan kerugian mental, fisik, sosial dalam berbagai bidang kehidupan dan penghidupan. Kejahatan seksual sekarang ini merebak dengan segala bentuk. Khususnya pada kasus pemerkosaan, pelaku tidak mengenal lagi status, pangkat, pendidikan, jasmani, dan usia korban. Bahkan banyak juga yang tega memperkosa orang yang dalam keadaan tidak berdaya, baik secara fisik maupun mental. Semua ini dilakukan apabila mereka merasa terpuaskan hawa nafsunya. Demikian juga usia pelaku yang tidak mengenal batas usia. Pada penulisan skripsi ini, penulis menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normative melalui studi pustaka (Library search). Sumber hukum dalam penulisan skripsi ini adalah bahan hukum primer, yaitu Undang-undang, bahan hukum sekunder yaitu buku yang relevan dan putusan pengadilan, serta bahan hukum sekunder yang bersumber dari artikel, majalah, internet, dan lain-lain. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwasanya pelaku pemerkosaan dapat dikenakan pasal 285 KUHP, tetapi jika korban adalah orang yang tidak berdaya maka dikenakan pasal 286 KUHP, ditambah lagi jika perbuatan tersebut dilakukan secara berkesinambungan, maka akan ditambah pemberatan atas perbuatan pidana tersebut. Maka dari itu peran pengadilan terutama hakim sangat menentukan dalam proses penegakkan keadilan, hakim dituntut bijaksana, adil dan jeli dalam menjatuhkan pidana bukan hanya melihat dari sisi pelaku tapi juga dari sisi korban.",

      "title": "Symbolic violence and the invisibility of disability",
      "abstract": "Disability as a social justice issue is not part of mainstream talk. Approximately 15% of the world’s population has a disability, and yet persons with disabilities are systematically subjected to this sort of exclusion. If considered in terms of social power, then persons with disabilities are the largest single minority group. Amongst minorities, exclusion from the social and representational order is a forceful form of symbolic violence. Persons with disabilities are systematically subjected to this sort of exclusion. In the public domain, persons with disabilities are either not represented at all, or misrepresented. The misrepresentation of persons with disabilities takes a host of cultural forms. This paper explores a few examples of these forms, as they can be considered examples of symbolic violence. We explore how negative social value may be internalised, and how this constitutes a form of symbolic violence experienced by persons with disabilities. We argue that persons with disabilities must constantly act against subtle and blatant acts of symbolic violence – including exclusion – and that the necessity of constant resistance characterises the lives of disabled persons. We argue that it is necessary not only to recognise the detrimental effects of having to confront the symbolic violence of a society which is structured for the benefit of those with typical embodiment, but also to frame this social injustice as something which leads to very real and very dangerous exclusions. Keywords: symbolic violence, disability, sexuality, representation, exclusion",

      "abstract": "Apart from insecurity posed by Boko Haram and other terrorists, there are other different concepts of insecurities that exist side by side in social policy such as material, social, economic, financial, psychological, housing, and personal autonomy. Insecurity is closely related or allied to poverty, Wresinki postulated and defined - lack of basic security - “as the absence of one of more factors that enable individuals and families to assume basic responsibilities and to enjoy fundamental human rights… chronic poverty results, when the lack of basic security simultaneously affects several aspects of the people’s lives, when it is prolonged, and when it seriously compromises people’s chances of regaining their rights and resuming of their responsibilities in the foreseeable future. [1] ” The root of insecurity is lack of resources, which means that each part of a person’s social life is compromised by the limitations that this places on each person’s capacity. The lack of resources is indirect poverty. Poor people are likely to be insecure, and his potentials are limited. Secondly, rights and responsibility are central to a place in society, and a place in the society is necessary for security. All over the world, even in the freest societies there exist laws, rules and regulations and a system of enforcement backed by sanctions for the protection of human persons in the overall interest of every citizen and the society at large. As it concerns, lives and properties, the nation will be impacted negatively and national development will suffer a decline as nobody will want to remain in a country where life, properties and investment will not be secure. Therefore this paper will not only examine security of human persons in Nigeria vis a vis other developed nations, the impact of insecurity of human persons on the country’s investment portfolio but will also consider the legal regime put in place by the various tiers of government in their bid to ensure security for every person living or doing business in Nigeria against the backdrop of increasing terrorist activities in the country. Therefore security of Human persons in Nigeria will be examined through the eye of terrorist activities which have left hundreds or thousands homeless and displaced, and its impact on national development.

      "abstract": "Comparing surveys from successive periods demonstrates that elderly people now enjoy a better and more varied sexual life than previous generations. The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour : older people’s repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

      "title": "From Experiencing Abuse to Seeking Protection: Examining the Shame of Intimate Partner Violence",
      "abstract": "Shame permeates the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). People who perpetrate IPV commonly use tactics designed to cause shame in their partner, including denigrating their dignity, undermining their autonomy, or harming their reputation. Many IPV survivors report an abiding sense of shame as a result of their victimization—from a lost sense of self, to self-blame, to fear of (or actual) social judgment. When seeking help for abuse, many survivors are directed to, or otherwise encounter, persons or institutions that reinforce rather than mitigate their shame. Survivors with marginalized social identities often must contend not only with the shame of IPV victimization, but also with the shame that follows being stigmatized or otherwise assigned inaccurate or incomplete \"identities.\" Understanding how these layers of shame can shape a survivor's experience matters. Shame can be a destructive harm that devastates a person's sense of self-worth. It can lead to long-term psychological injury, and can be both a source and outcome of trauma. A desire to reduce shame's damaging impact can cause survivors to utilize coping behaviors that may be self-protective, but profoundly misunderstood by the people and institutions to whom they turn for help. Included among those institutions is the civil legal system. Protection orders are the most common legal intervention for IPV and can be critical tools for responding to it. Yet to obtain a protection order, survivors must enter a process that often deprives them of their privacy and ability to control their self-image—experiences anchored in shame. Without understanding shame's behavioral and psychological effects, survivors risk having their claims of victimization discredited, harming their ability to obtain necessary safety and relief. This Article explores these individual, social, and institutional dimensions of shame. It examines how those who work or interact with survivors can better understand the shame that results from traumatic experiences, and the trauma that results from shame-intensive ones. This Article further explores strategies to reduce the shame that can pervade civil litigation. These strategies include prioritizing survivor dignity and narrative control—critical antidotes to the harms that shame can cause.",

      "title": "Legal regulation of anti-discrimination and mobing in the field of labor",
      "abstract": "The absence of discrimination in the workplace is an important condition for productive work, mental and physical health of employees, preservation of a sense of human dignity and personality development, a healthy moral climate in the team, effective communication in production in vertical and horizontal planes and other necessary processes in the field of work, since any labor team is not only a production, but also a social environment. The negative impact of discrimination is felt far beyond the boundaries of a specific workplace, as negative emotions affect a person's family, friendships, and other social relationships. Anti-discrimination problems are the subject of research by specialists in legal, social and economic sciences, in particular, the legal protection of employees is being studied according to individual characteristics: gender, disability, HIV-positive status, migration, gender identity, ethnic or linguistic minorities, etc. There are a number of international and national regulations that prohibit unequal treatment of employees on grounds unrelated to a person's qualifications, productivity, and business qualities. Prohibition of mobbing (harassment) and establishment of responsibility for such actions became a relatively new phenomenon for national legislation. Adherence to the principle of equal treatment of employees and non-discrimination is one of the main areas of activity of the International Labor Organization, which is reflected in the norms of a number of conventions and recommendations. One of the latest is Convention No. 190 on Violence and Harassment, adopted by the ILO in 2019, which once again emphasizes the importance of creating decent working conditions for individuals on the basis of equality in the absence of any violence or harassment. In Ukrainian legislation, there are norms regarding the support of certain vulnerable groups of employees - minors, persons of pre-retirement age, internally displaced persons, persons with disabilities and others. This phenomenon is sometimes called \"positive discrimination\", which is socially determined. Discrimination and mobbing must be excluded from labor relations as those that reduce the quality of life, hinder decent work and human development, therefore the presence of clearly defined norms that establish responsibility for such actions is very important. Anti-discrimination legislation provides for disciplinary, material, financial, administrative and criminal liability for relevant offenses. Changes were made to the administrative legislation regarding the establishment of liability for mobbing (harassment) at the workplace, but there are no clearly defined norms regarding liability for violation of the prohibition of discrimination, as well as no definition of the act itself.",

      "title": "PATERNALISME DALAM TINDAKAN MEDIS",
      "abstract": "Abstract: In an ethical context, paternalism means any act that limits someone’s freedom, without his/her consent, for the purpose of either preventing the person from doing himself any harm, or carrying out something positive in a way that can not be achieved by himself/herself. The principle of paternalism must be distinguished from the harm principle. The principle of paternalism says that one’s freedom may be limited if one will inflict the harm on oneself due to one’s attitude, or will not be able to achieve something beneficial for himself/herself. Meanwhile, the harm principle says that someone’s freedom may be limited if the purpose is to protect another person from the harm inflicted by the first party. In medical service sector, paternalism causes conflicts between the principle of beneficence and the principle of autonomy. This is evident if a doctor takes a certain medical action based on the principle of beneficence without giving any information to the competent patient, or the doctor gives the information only to the family. In this situation, there is no informed consent. However paternalism can not cause conflict between these two ethical principles if the patient is not autonomous, so that he/she is not competent to make a decision that can be justified. Key words: paternalism, patient, doctor, competent Abstrak: Dalam konteks etika, paternalisme dimaksudkan setiap tindakan yang membatasi kebebasan seseorang tanpa persetujuannya, yang bertujuan mencegah terjadinya kerugian baginya, atau melakukan sesuatu yang baik, yang tidak dapat diperolehnya dengan cara lain. Prinsip paternalisme perlu dibedakan dengan prinsip kerugian. Prinsip paternalisme mengatakan bahwa kebebasan seseorang boleh dibatasi, jika orang itu akan merugikan dirinya sendiri karena kelakuannya sendiri, atau tidak akan memperoleh sesuatu yang sangat baik bagi dirinya. Sedangkan prinsip kerugian mengatakan bahwa kebebasan seseorang boleh dibatasi untuk melindungi orang lain dari kerugian. Di bidang pelayanan medis, paternalisme dapat menimbulkan konflik antara prinsip berbuat baik dan prinsip otonomi bila dokter mengambil tindakan medis tertentu atas dasar prinsip berbuat baik (the principle of beneficence) tanpa memberi informasi kepada pasien yang kompeten, atau hanya menyampaikannya kepada pihak keluarga. Dalam kondisi seperti ini tak ada informed consent atau informed choice dari pihak pasien, dan paternalisme ini tak dapat dibenarkan. Namun terdapat situasi di mana paternalisme tidak menimbulkan konflik antara kedua prinsip etika ini, yakni apabila pasien memang tidak otonom sehingga tidak kompeten untuk mengambil suatu keputusan rasional yang dapat dipertanggungjawabkan. Kata kunci: paternalisme, pasien, dokter, kompeten",

      "title": "Older Adults Acceptability of Physical Activity",
      "abstract": "Engagement in recommended levels of physical activity decreases dramatically with age, despite many health and social benefits. Effective implementation of physical activity services for older adults requires that such provision is acceptable to them. Older adults living in deprived areas, where lack of resources can result in unmet basic needs, are twice as likely to be inactive as those in more affluent areas, suggesting lower levels of acceptability of leisure time physical activity. Older adults with lower socioeconomic status also experience greater barriers to physical activity yet are often omitted from research. \nAcceptability is often conceptualised as the level of tolerance required to undertake health behaviours in order to gain future health-related benefits. As many older adults may view physical activity as irrelevant, a waste of limited resources, or a luxury that only the well, or well-off, can indulge in, an alternative approach may be more fitting. The term acceptability can also be used to denote how attractive health behaviours are perceived to be to the target audience, and whether or not they are actively sought out. When viewed through this lens, physical activity may be seen as an enjoyable way to spend time connecting with others, whilst still reaping the many benefits for health and wellbeing. \nThis PhD aimed to address the gap in knowledge on the role acceptability of physical activity plays in the engagement in physical activity by older adults and to explore the impact of socioeconomic factors on such acceptability. A meta-synthesis was conducted to identify underlying reasons older adults have for wanting to engage in physical activity (or not). Few data were found from low socioeconomic status areas. The impact of providers views on acceptability were rarely considered in the literature. A multi-perspective interview study was therefore conducted within low socioeconomic status areas to explore acceptability of physical activity in this context. Views on what made physical activity acceptable to older adults (with reasons for such acceptability) were elicited both from older adults in low socioeconomic status areas and from providers of physical activity programmes in these locations. This study resulted in two papers, one published paper on the conflation of time and energy from the older adults' perspective, and one paper (in preparation) on the wider multi-perspective views of older adults and providers on the acceptability of physical activity. A published book chapter giving an overview of how to implement these findings to make physical activity interventions more acceptable to older adults completes this research. \nFocusing on fun and enjoyment rather than long-term health outcomes within physical activity services does appear more acceptable to many older adults. Actively encouraging socialising by providing time and space around and within physical activity increases the value to many and may be particularly important in deprived areas where there may be limited other opportunities for socialising. Providers may need to think outside their remit or work collaboratively with those from other sectors to achieve this multi-functional physical activity/social provision in order to encourage older adults in deprived areas into what could otherwise be an unfamiliar concept, leisure time physical activity. Encouraging socialising within physical activity can be an effective use of limited resources, increasing acceptability of physical activity as a by-product of satisfying highly valued social needs.",

      "title": "Magic Bullet?: Supportive 'Communities' Overcoming the Cycle of Homelessness",
      "abstract": "Homelessness generally occurs as part of a cycle, and the causes are often interrelated and have cumulative effects. For participants in a recent study, common factors involved in becoming homeless included family breakdown or disconnection, addiction, substance abuse, lack of skills or qualifications and being unable to find work, and physical and mental health complications. These were often brought to a head by particular trigger events such as leaving home, being released from prison, the death of a relative, eviction, or mental breakdown. While most of these factors individually would have their impact limited by the welfare system, personal determination, family, and other forms of support, participants almost invariably experienced more than one, often concurrently. This is more than just bad luck. The risk factors mentioned above do not only lead to homelessness, they also lead to further risk factors. For this reason, traditional systems of support often fail to cope.",

      "abstract": "Since the 1960s the increase in erotic entertainment has conveyed a clear message: the more sex the better.This has resulted in myths about sexual norms, which if believed may lead to behaviour result- ing in the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases or in sexual dysfunction, or both.The psychosexual problems seen in departments of genitourinary medicine are either secondary to sexually acquired infection or primarily psychological. General reactionsWhen genital lesions are seen, felt, or suspected most patients lose interest in sexual intercourse, or at least restrain themselves for fear of infecting their partners.Those disinhibited by drugs or alcohol or of a psychopathic nature may, however, continue to have inter- course, and particular care must be taken to explain the dangers to others of such behaviour.Marital discord-The innocently infected partner ofa patient who has had intercourse outside a stable relationship may realise the implications of a sexually transmitted disease but may not want the diagnosis spelt out.The doctor therefore should not force the diagnosis on the patient but give him or her room to manoeuvre by saying, for instance, \"Is there anything more you would like to know?\".Often the answer is \"No.\"Anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression-Under the stress of having a sexually transmitted disease the extravert may become angry and the introvert anxious or depressed.Anger may be directed at the clinic staff as well as the person who transmitted the infection.Recognition of this anger may allow the doctor to intervene and discuss the facts and feelings surrounding a patient's illness.This may prevent later violence towards the patient's sexual partner.Unfortunately, in the case of the psychopath such intervention may not alter the patient's strong feelings or the outcome.The neurotic introvert is more likely to become anxious or depressed under stress, particularly when he or she has had intercourse outside a stable relationship.When severe these symptoms must be taken seriously.Clinical anxiety may be dealt with by letting the patient voice his feelings, and later by reassurance.In some patients the anxiety is so severe that a short course ofbenzodiazepines (such as diazepam 2 mg three times a day) may need to be given.Guilt and depression often go together, though most cases of depression seen in clinics are not severe; if necessary antidepressants such as mianserin 30-60 mg at night may be given; the dose should be built up slowly to prevent undue sleepiness in a working person.When the depression is deeper, psychiatric help should be enlisted, but the patient may refuse unless the psychiatrists are on the spot at the clinic.A clinically trivial condition such as recurring non-gonococcal urethritis, as well as the more serious problems of genital herpes, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute epididymitis, and hepatitis B, may all cause anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression.Allowing such patients to air their feelings is vital.",

Another common subtype, moderation of other disparities by rural-urban status is when other types of disparities are more pronounced among older adults living in rural areas than those living in urban and suburban areas.

      "title": "Special features of psychiatric treatment for the elderly",
      "abstract": "Abstract Three themes underlie the topics in this chapter. Physical, psychological, and social problems often occur together, linked by chance or causality in the life of the old person. Very rarely can one problem be dealt with in isolation, and many different sources of expertise may be engaged with a single individual. Therefore good coordination between different agents is essential in old age psychiatry, both for the individual patient and in the overall planning of services. Many of the pathologies characteristic of old age are gradual in onset and degenerative in nature, and more due to failures in processes of repair than to an ‘external foe’, so the distinction between disease and health is often quantitative rather than qualitative. ‘Normality’ becomes a social construct with fluid borderlines, containing the overlapping (but not identical) concepts of ‘statistically common’ and ‘functionally intact’. Thus the popular perception of normal old age includes the ‘statistically common’ facts of dependence and failing function, whereas ‘intactness’ (excellent health and vigorous social participation) is seen as remarkable rather than the norm. But the boundaries of ‘old age’ are also socially constructed—in developed countries good health at the age of 65 would nowadays be regarded as a normal middle-aged experience, whereas superb health at 95 would still be something noteworthy. Since some degree of physical dependence, forgetfulness, and vulnerability to social exclusion is expected in old age, meeting those needs is also regarded as a ‘normal’ demand on families and community agencies such as social services, rather than the responsibility of health care providers. As the severity of the needs increases, however, so also does the perceived role of health professionals, both as direct service providers and in support of other agencies. Because of the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in old age (especially among the ‘older old’), questions frequently arise as to the competence of patients to make decisions. Older people who cannot manage decisions alone may come to depend increasingly on others for help; or, resisting dependence, they become vulnerable through neglect of themselves or through the injudicious decisions they make. When an incompetent person is cared for by a spouse or family member, the danger of self-neglect or of ill-considered decisions is lessened, but instead, there are the risks of faulty decisions by the caregiver (whether through ignorance or malice), and also risks to the health of the caregiver from the burden of dependence by the incompetent person. Legal mechanisms, differing from one country to another, exist to safeguard the interests of incompetent people. These three themes will be developed further, and with them the following special topics: 1 multiple problems: including sleep disorders in old age, medication in old age psychiatry, and psychological treatments in old age psychiatry; 2 blurred boundaries of normality: including the role of specialist services and support between agencies; 3 incapacity and dependence: including balancing the needs of patients and caregivers, abuse of older people, ethical issues, and medico-legal arrangements for safeguarding decisions.",

      "title": "DIFFERENCES DETERMINED BY INSTITUTIONALIZATION ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF THE ELDERLY",
      "abstract": "The older population is in permanent growth in the total of human resources. Romania already appears with 17% old persons in the general population, with increase perspectives in the following years. Due to this fact, OMS has demanded, as a timely objective, among chronic diseases, cancer, AIDS, alcoholism and the aging phenomenon. The institutionalization of the elderly supposes living his existence in another environment, different from the family or social one, practically operating a `separation` of the individual and the world. Beyond the functional aspects, these institutions represent a social, psychological and moral space that bears a precise symbolic significance. They `separate` from the big mass of individuals those that need, due to special necessities of supervised regime, a permanent specialized assistance, in institutions reserved for those that, by their nature or psychosocial behavior, cannot help themselves. In conclusion, any form of individual or collective deprivation will be perceived as a `limitation`, as a frustration, or as a situation that totally suppresses freedom. In conclusion, institutionalization, even if driven by the best of intentions, may often produce human characters of a great variety and abnormality. Even if they cannot be included in the category of psychiatric disorders, we can find, in most of the situations, `neurotic character structure disorders`. Knowing the alterations and the psychological implications that appear in institutionalized elders represents a big step for the elaboration of therapy programs and varying assistance strategies for these categories.",

      "title": "Stand tall against shortcomings",
      "abstract": "News headlines are frequently dominated by accounts of high profile, seemingly respected individuals accused of personal or professional shortcomings. Illegal or immoral activities appear to be commonplace for those who are well established and have excelled in their careers. What ignites poor decision making among people who appear to have everything? Do they understand that their actions may result in dramatic untoward effects on their careers and personal lives? Is bad behavior generated from a sense of entitlement?FigureWhether it's elected officials who've accepted bribes or the revelation of the tumultuous affairs of sports figures, a common thread appears to be that the individuals involved all developed a strong self-confidence and an overinflated ego—both rationalized by a sense of entitlement. Many individuals who have their trespasses exposed believe that because of their societal rank, they no longer have to follow a standard set of rules or behaviors reserved for those who are less successful than they are. Nurses aren't immune from making poor professional choices. Some nurses have a tendency to believe that because of their tenure within an organization or their years of experience, they should be pardoned from the basic expectations of their positions. Minor infractions might include taking longer than allowed breaks, tardiness, excessive absenteeism, or inappropriately verbalizing their frustrations. As nurse managers we need to be consistent on how we deal with these issues. Both senior and junior nurses within the department will be carefully examining the situation to see if you distinguish the manner in which the issue is handled. Your credibility will be severely damaged if your actions aren't consistent for all and appropriate for the situation. Nurses need to fully understand that they're in a profession that's governed by regulatory agencies. Failure to fully comply with established principles and guidelines may yield detrimental results. Breaches in practice such as failing to sign opioid wastage, writing orders from physicians without appropriate authorization, and making clinical decisions outside the scope of practice are all examples of behaviors that aren't only wrong, but may be illegal as well. Failure to follow established principles in behavior may not only result in losing a job, but also culminate in the forfeiture of a state nursing license or even imprisonment. As nurse leaders we need to appreciate that our role in the organization doesn't abdicate our responsibility to consistently act in a manner that's in accordance with the standards of the profession. It's imperative for us to role model conduct that's of the highest standards and not fall prey to believing that the leadership role we hold allows us to behave inappropriately. Most nurse managers are responsible for managing millions of dollars and leading many team members. The highest degree of integrity and honesty must be consistently practiced to maintain a safe and fair work setting. Tenured team members and leaders commonly receive privileges that more junior members need to earn. Seniority benefits commonly include higher salaries, better parking, more vacation time, and other earned rewards dependent on the social and economic status of the organization. These types of privileges should be preserved and enhanced but shouldn't jeopardize the organization's integrity. The benefits that senior staff and leaders receive should be based on the wisdom they impart to others. Experience should never be construed as an authorization to act in a manner that's inconsistent with established standards and principles of the profession.FigureRichard Hader [email protected]",

In contrast, bullies showed lower increases in inflammation into adulthood compared with those uninvolved in bullying. Elevated systemic low-grade inflammation is a mechanism by which this common childhood social adversity may get under the skin to affect adult health functioning, even many years later.",

Audiences vary in their reactions; what’s wrongful in one audience may be acceptable in another—hence, deviance is relative to audience, society, subgroup, context, and historical time. Typically, reactions express negative attitudes toward the violations of a strongly-held norm. Such reactions are varied, and include condemnation, withdrawing from the presence of the offender, and the unwillingness to join in interaction with the offending party or parties. Most members of the society can perform a mental experiment to picture what these reactions are likely to be for a range of audiences. The researcher conducted a survey among 60 park-goers to determine what is considered wrongful in the park. In the park, multiple parties put on performances of extremely eccentric or deviant behaviour. Felonious crime is very rare in the park; milder forms of deviance are common, however, including offensive staring and selling marijuana. Public gay sex, which used to be common, has all but disappeared there.",

Individuals or groups experience social disjuncture due to poverty, discrimination, loss of employment, relationships with relatives, imprisonment, illness, and addictions. One of the groups experiencing social disjuncture is men, and the stereotypes of society towards men further increase the risk of exclusion of this social group. Due to men’s social disjuncture, their social and professional life becomes very limited; their repulsive experience limits decisionmaking, and disrupts the expression of socially acceptable behavior. Men in social disjuncture suffer from social rejection, inferiority; self-doubt, diminished self-esteem, their social skills, and social expression are often unacceptable in society. They often refuse to make positive decisions that can improve their quality of life, do not recognize their uniqueness, otherness, and avoid socially significant changes, bold decisions. Men who have been separated for a long time exhibit aggressive behavior and become even more isolated as a result. The social disjuncture of men can be successfully reduced in the group of social changes aimed at men’s self and knowledge of the environment, development of social skills, development of suitable alternatives for socially unacceptable behavior, increasing social inclusion in society.",

      "abstract": "Violence among children and young people is considered to be any physical or psychological violent behavior aimed at children and young people and done on purpose by their peers. This has a goal of insulting and it includes repetition of the same behavioral principle and perseverance of an unequal strength ratios, i.e. stronger against weaker or group against individual. Children bullying behavior has been an established behavior in our society and school that it is ignored very often and considered to be a “part of a normal behavior”. However, researches show that bullying has long lasting consequences both on victims and doers. Furthermore, sharp reactions against bullying have consequences of an extreme increase of violence in schools that obtain great media attention. Bullying includes different types of violent behavior ranking from hassle or purpose social isolation and ignoring to severe offences and abuse. Bullying doers could be individual or groups of peers. This type of behavior is objectionable and socially unacceptable. It is estimated that more than three fourths of adolescents have some kind of experience related to bullying such as calling names or public scorn. The aim of the paper is to present bullying as one of the major social problems that has a serious effect on the school children and youth’s wellbeing. It is going to present bullying in relation to the type, including “cyber-bullying”, thereupon, in relation to the individual characteristics of a victim and bullying doer, in relation to the environmental elements which have some influence on bullying, as well as bullying effects and prevention.",

      "abstract": "The phrase 4*wrongful life has been coined to cover several kinds of tort claims which have some resemblance to each other, but which also have important differences. The first of these is a suit by an il legitimate child asking for damages from his parents or others to compensate him for the stigma or deprivation which the status of il legitimacy generally carries with it. These cases have been discussed elsewhere.1 Another kind of suit to which the same label is some times attached is that which arises when a man or woman engages a physician to perform an operation for sterilization or to supply con traceptive devices and a child is later born as a result of the physi cian's alleged negligence in performing the operation or in pro viding the contraception. This claim is made by the parents, not the child, and therefore involves quite different issues from those in the suit by the illegitimate child. It is sometimes also referred to as a suit for wrongful or wrongful conception. A third type of claim arises when a woman gives birth to a defective or deformed or mentally retarded child as a result of the alleged negligence of her physician either in not preventing the birth or in not informing her",

      "abstract": "Friction between teenagers and social norms is a phenomenon that often occurs in today's society. One of the issues that dominates the discussion about adolescent behavior is youth violence. The phenomenon of juvenile delinquency, which involves violating the rules that apply in society, is a common thing. Psychological changes during adolescence make some teenagers fight and break the rules that limit their freedom. Criminal acts are not limited to specific age groups or certain genders. Crime can be committed by anyone, both men and women, at the age of a child, adult, or elderly. Crime acts can be committed consciously or unconsciously, sometimes driven by strong impulses, compulsions, obsessions, or even instinctive reflexes. Social norms play an essential role in shaping the identity and orientation of adolescents.However, sometimes conflicts occur between adolescent behavior and prevailing social norms. Factors such as rapid social change, the influence of social media, pressure from peers, and wrong social norms can influence adolescent violent behavior. Social norms are important in regulating behavior, maintaining morality, forming identity, and building social harmony. This study uses a qualitative method with a descriptive approach.

This is due to most of the children who have ever become sexual abuse victims are reluctant to be open. Therefore, parents should be able to recognize the signs of the children experiencing any sexual abuse. Child Sexual abuse will result continuously terrible impacts, not only on its victims’ health problems but also on their psychological condition, such as permanent trauma, even after they have been grown up. The traumatic impacts of sexual abuse experienced by children are as follows: betrayal (betrayal or trust crisis of the children towards adults); traumatic sexualization; powerlessness (helpless feeling); and stigmatization. Physically, there is perhaps nothing to be questioned on sexual abuse victims, but psychologically, it can cause addiction, trauma, and even revenge. Unless it is treated seriously, child sexual abuse can lead to a broad social impacts in the society. Handling and healing psychological trauma as a result of sexual abuse should get serious attention from any related parties, such as family, society and country. Therefore, to protect children, it is necessary to provide a system approach including social welfare system for children and families, internationally standardized judicial systems and mechanisms to encourage appropriate behavior in the society",

      "abstract": "Despite affecting millions of families around the world, parental alienation has been largely unacknowledged or denied by legal and health professionals as a form of family violence. This complex form of aggression entails a parental figure engaging in the long-term use of a variety of aggressive behaviors to harm the relationship between their child and another parental figure, and/or to hurt the other parental figure directly because of their relationship with their child. Like other forms of family violence, parental alienation has serious and negative consequences for family members, yet victims are often blamed for their experience. In order to be recognized as a form of family violence and to secure protection for victims under law and social policies, a formal review and comparison of parental alienating behaviors and outcomes to child abuse and intimate partner violence has been sorely needed. The result of this review highlights how the societal denial of parental alienation has been like the historical social and political denial or other forms of abuse in many parts of the world (e.g., child abuse a century ago). Reframing parental alienating behaviors as a form of family violence also serves as a desperate call to action for social scientists to focus more theoretical and empirical attention to this topic.

      "abstract": "Causing harm to others would hardly seem to be relevant to cooperation, other than as a barrier to it. However, because selfish individuals will exploit cooperators, functional punishment is an effective mechanism for enforcing cooperation by deterring free-riding. Although functional punishment can shape the social behaviour of others by targeting non-cooperative behaviour, it can also intimidate others into doing almost anything. Second-party functional punishment is a self-serving behaviour at the disposal of dominant individuals who can coerce others into behaving cooperatively, but it need not do so. Third-party and altruistic functional punishment are less likely to be selfishly motivated and would seem more likely to maintain norms of cooperation in large groups. These forms of functional punishment may be an essential part of non-kin cooperation on a scale exhibited only by humans. While punitive sentiments might be the psychological force behind punitive behaviours, spiteful motives might also play an important role. Furthermore, functionally spiteful acts might not be maladaptive; reckoning gains relative to others rather than in absolute terms can lead to hyper-competitiveness, which might also be an important part of human cooperation, rather than just an ugly by-product.",

      "abstract": "Sociologists tend to define deviance in one of two ways: by the negative reactions an act, the expression of a belief, or a physical characteristic generates, or by the violation of the norms or the rules that prevail in a given society or group. Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake and Kingsley, 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviant is a formal violation of the rules. Although the wording of reactivists and normative definitions appear similar, each conceptualization focuses attention on very different aspects of deviance: the normative definitions focus on the person who engages in norm‐violating behavior while reactivist definitions focus on the social audiences that define deviants.",

      "title": "Criminogenic Causes and Factors that Contribute to the Commission of Crime by a Minor",
      "abstract": "Regarding the age from which the criminal responsibility of the minor begins, it is noteworthy that the age limits that define the minor depend on each legal system and take into account the economic, social, political and cultural system of each state. Consequently, the minority comprises an age group between 7 and 18 years or older. For example, in the United States, the demarcation line between minors and adults differs from state to state and, sometimes, even within the same jurisdiction, depending on the context. If, in a certain state, an 18-year-old can sign a contract, he or she cannot buy alcohol before reaching the age of 21. Therefore, each American state has its own laws that define the concept of minor and adult. Thus, in the state of Massachusetts, any child between the ages of 7 and 17 “who violates an ordinance or municipal decision or commits any offense under a Commonwealth law” is considered a juvenile offender - unless he or she is charged with murder or crime, in which case shall be treated as an adult at the age of 14 years, although there is no reason to explain why the same defendant should be treated as minor when being charged with theft and as an adult when charged with murder (Semenescu & Semenescu, 2009, p. 50).",

Children increased their sharing to a desired friend after friendly overtures from him (her) and retaliated small donations by an established friend with decreased sharing. In still more neutral conditions, the children followed a norm of equality that was introduced into the experimental situation. Subsequent sharing with a needy child was related neither to feeling good nor to feeling guilty. Also subjects did not respond differently in the experimental conditions because of sex. Finally highly popular children followed more reciprocal patterns of sharing than other children, and were more susceptible to modeling influences",

Not only are they likely to be men, but many studies also show they are likely to be in their early 20’s, from disturbed, dysfunctional family backgrounds with some prior criminal experience, not necessarily for crimes of violence. These features that murderers tend to have in common, can be seen as contributing to a limited portfolio of ways of dealing with other people. Their dysfunctional backgrounds mean that they have difficulty in feeling and knowing what it means to be a person, especially in seeing the world form another’s point of view. They see the cause of their frustration, anger or jealousy, or opportunity to slake their greed, as encapsulated in the object of another being. They want to remove or destroy that entity as the only way they can relate to the individual they see as causing their reactions. Murderers therefore provide a rather exaggerated illustration of the consequences of confusing the person and their body, violating the body through acts of aggression, as a product of this confusion",

Although prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination at the individual level are generally positively associated empirically, prejudice and stereotypes do not necessarily lead to discrimination, and discrimination can occur in the absence of conscious prejudice and stereotypes. Classic contributions on this topic characterized discrimination mainly in terms of negative actions by individuals—ranging from verbal comments to physical injury—directed to harm of another group and its members. However, in addition to blatant and direct forms of discrimination, discrimination may be displayed as unjustified positive treatment of members of one’s own group relative to members of another group, or it may represent actions toward members of another group that initially appear favorable but ultimately disadvantage the other group in the longer term (e.g., patronizing behavior, such as chivalry). Discrimination is often represented in terms of the behavior of individuals directed toward members, but these acts are not necessarily consciously motivated. Moreover, individual bias expressed by individuals is not necessary for discrimination to be experienced by members of some groups. Instead, discrimination may be enacted broadly through institutional structures and policies or embedded in cultural beliefs and representations that value various groups differently. Thus, individual-, institutional-, and cultural-level processes may operate in concert to provide some groups systematic advantages and/or to impose disadvantages on other groups. Often these influences are cloaked in justifications or ideologies that obscure the unfairness of the influences and thus allow the discriminatory nature of the treatment to go undetected and unaddressed. The remainder of this examination of discrimination considers (i) personality and individual differences related to behaving in a discriminatory way, (ii) social psychological influences that promote discrimination, (iii) subtle manifestations of discrimination, (iv) institutional and cultural forms of bias; (v) the impact of discrimination psychologically and physically, and (vi) ways of combating discrimination.",

      "abstract": "It is understandable that school peers, significant adults, and the public in general may assume that gifted and talented individuals do not have unique social and emotional needs. When common, positive stereotypes prevail based on images of confident and motivated students, athletes, and musicians, giftedness might be perceived as being unrelated to social and emotional concerns. Educators and others may therefore not recognize or address social and emotional needs, assuming that gifted students deal easily with developmental challenges. Early scholarly work related to giftedness may also have contributed to the notion that high capability means solid mental and physical health and success and satisfaction in career and relationships. Research samples have often not been inclusive enough to reflect concerns of a broad range of high-potential students and may have perpetuated positive stereotypes. In addition, deeply engrained societal attitudes as well as democratic and egalitarian political views may, for many citizens, preclude thinking that students with high-level abilities should be given special attention for social and emotional needs. Federal education mandates have also reflected little concern for the well-being of gifted and talented students. Even the field of gifted education may not have advocated as strongly as it could have for proactive approaches to promote healthy social and emotional development.",

      "abstract": "The law has long since recognized that there are many young people who “come of age” and are due to have their sentences transferred to the adult system at age 18, but who may not be able to withstand incarceration for a number of reasons. Specifically, in New South Wales, s19(3) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 recognizes that a young person under the age of 21 may be able to serve some or all of their term of imprisonment as a juvenile offender if the young person is deemed to meet criteria of “special circumstances”. Section 19(4) specifies those circumstances as illness or disability, access to educational, vocational and therapeutic programmes and the risk of psychological or physical risk of harm. The underlying principle in this regard is that juveniles are typically at a different developmental stage from adults and have unique levels of need as compared with adult offenders. Thus, juveniles are considered to be potentially subject to a number of factors related to “vulnerability” that may invoke consideration of s19.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paraphilia or deviance is sexual stimulation or action that deviates from normal sexual behavior, but is necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm. People with paraphilia have unusual sexual interests, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children and corpses), and animals. Another paraphilic disorder involving a disapproving individual is characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, compulsions, or behavior in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the other person being unwilling or unable to consent. However, it is not specifically described in any of the other so-called Paraphilic Disorder categories (e.g., arousal patterns involving corpses or animals). CASE REPORT: Here, we report a case of a male patient aged 37 years, unmarried status, his last education graduated from elementary school, the patient complained that he had frequent contact with cows, he had been experiencing it for 2 years, he felt lonely and had no close friends. As a child, he was often scolded and beaten by his father. He is also often teased by his friends. CONCLUSION: Zoophilia is another paraphilic disorder involving disapproving individuals characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, drives, or behaviors in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the animal. This case is rarely reported because sufferers think their actions are not harmful, lack of parental attention and supervision may be one of the causes of this disorder.",

Approved traits such as altruism may not be projected by the non-insightful; they may, however, be projected by the insightful. 11. Altruism is related to the relative value with which relationships are regarded. Relationships which, while prevalent in lay or professional thinking or both, have not been substantiated by the present study include: 1. The individual who attends church or synagogue regularly is apt to be more altruistic than one who does not. 2. The inhibition or control of impulses or desires involved in altruistic behavior is conducive to neurotic symptomology. 3. Those attracted to the sciences are more altruistically inclined than those attracted to law, business, or engineering. 4. The political liberal or leftist is apt to be more altruistic than the conservative or rightist. 5. Professed ease in relationships is correlated with altruism. 6. An child is apt to be significantly more egoistic than the average. Perhaps in the long run the most rewarding product of this study is one that had not been consciously hypothesized: the precipitation from the matrix of a configuration of variables that appears fully consistent with Becker's concept of the sacred pole of the sacred-secular continuum. Appearing as it did as the first dimension to be extracted and accounting for a larger amount of the matrix variance than any of the other seven dimensions which followed (including configurations consistent with the constructs socioeconomic status and social acceptability), it would seem to grant considerable support to Becker's contention that the construct sacred is not only objectively possible but objectively probable.22 If the sacred can be shown by factor analysis to be a dimension underlying the surface relationships between many of the variables of interest to the contemporary sociologist and psychologist, then the construct warrants considerably more attention from the quantitatively-oriented investigator than it has received to date.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The extent to which a child with autism continues to develop in the same way during his or her life is of the utmost importance to everyone concerned. Autism is characterized by pervasive impairments in social interactions and communication that are manifested in the first 3 years of life. The most compelling question asked by parents at the time of diagnosis, usually when the child is quite young, is whether the child will be able to have a “normal life.” Implicit in this question is the issue of change and continuity-whether the child will ever be able to relate socially to other people, learn to speak and communicate with others, function in dependently, and abstain from the repetitive and stereotyped behaviors that char acterize children with autism. The deficits in social communication that define autism are evidenced to some degree irrespective of intellectual ability (Szatmari et al., 1989). Individual outcomes, however, evince considerable variability, ranging from a very small number of autistic adults who manage to achieve relative normalcy in their level of functioning to the majority who continue to suffer significant impairments throughout their lives. Defining those characteristics of the disorder that tend to remain stable and those that show change represents an ini tial approach toward identifying the extent and nature of plasticity in the development of children with autism.",

By contrast, sacrifice of personal gain by non-human animals is often interpreted as frustration. Spite may thus be a uniquely human motivator. However, to date, no empirical study has demonstrated that psychological spite actually drives human behaviour, leaving the motivation for inequity aversion unclear. Here, we ask whether 4- to 9-year-old children and adults reject disadvantageous inequity (less for self, more for peer) out of spite or frustration. We show that children, but not adults, are more likely to reject disadvantageous allocations when doing so deprives their peer of a better reward (spite) than when their peer has already received the better reward (frustration). Spiteful motivations are thus present early in childhood and may be a species-specific component of humans' developing cooperative and competitive behaviour.",

      "title": "Impact of Youth Marriage Against Social Behavior (Study in Kenagarian Surantih Pesisir Selatan).",
      "abstract": "Marriage can only be held when the bride and groom have met the requirements of physical maturity. Which can be interpreted that the marriage of young age is a marriage done before reaching the age of 19 years for men and 16 years for women or immature (psychological, pedagogical, and economic). Young marriage has many unfavorable effects in building a home, such as the occurrence of a divorce because it does not seem to be the real purpose of marriage. But there is no doubt that not all marriages at a young age have a bad effect on a family because not a few of those who have been married at a young age can maintain and maintain family unity according to the purpose of the marriage itself. Another factor triggering the occurrence of young marriage in Surantih this is due to lack of education there. The average that married young age is children who are still in the 12-year study program. As a result of the divorce, there are many occurrences of inappropriate behavior in society, the behavior of widows or widowers who are young, resulting in deviant social behavior. Distorted social behavior is like, women leave their natures as mothers, to seek pleasure of themselves with other men, so children abandoned. And finally the child from the marriage of young age less get the affection from both parents. Likewise with men, many are not responsible for the child and his wife, sehinggan man in marriage law no 1 year 1974 article 34 verse 1 reads is obliged to protect wife and give all necessity of life of marriage according to its ability.  The type of research conducted is qualitative research using descriptive method. This research was conducted in Kenagarian Surantiah, Kecamatan Sutera Pesisir Selatan Regency. Selection of this location is based on the consideration that in Surantiah this is still there are many couples who do marriage of young age, with from 467 family of 217 families in Kenagarian Surantiah married at young age. The samples of this study consist of: Head of KUA, BP4 Employee, Couples who get married at a young age, Parent couples who marry young age, Children of couples who marry young age, Community Leaders. The data collection techniques used are: Interview technique, Observation Study, Documentation study.  Based on research that researchers do the results of this study, more focused on the impact of marriage of young age on social behavior caused by marriage of young age. Impact arising from marriage of young age include: impact on husband and wife (young couple), among others: between changing the status of children or adolescents to parents this thing causing mental development so as not to be able to solve existing problems, too quickly experience changes in the social environment of society, they will more tends to adjust to the new environment. Then on the wife is not old enough to contain and give birth so that this will disrupt the condition of her baby and its contents. The impact of the marriage of young age will also affect the parents of the perpetrator in this case the family environment in Minangkabau especially the newly married Surantih people will stay at home parents of women. If the man (husband) is polite and courteous, will make the in-laws and mamak happy otherwise if the lazy man then this will affect the relationship on both sides of the family (from the family wife and husband's family) eventually divorce early. Factors driving the occurrence of marriage at an early age in the study sites include: economic factors, parent factors, educational factors, factors themselves and local customary factors. Economic factors, because families who live in low socioeconomic conditions / can not meet the needs of everyday life. Educational factors of low level of education and knowledge of parents, children, the importance of education. While the factor itself is because the relationship is close then they decide to get married soon. Parents factor is the parents prepare / find a mate for his son. Because of the adat factor of the marriage of young age is caused by parents' fear of gossip from near neighbors. If the daughter has not yet got a spouse, the parent will be afraid that the child is said to be an old maid.  Impacts arising from the marriage of young age include: the impact on husband and wife that is the occurrence of quarrels and small squabbles in the household, the impact on the children that is the low level of intelligence and IQ in children and the existence of disturbances on the physical development of children. The impact on each family if the marriage among children is not smooth then the parents will feel disappointed and concerned about the incident. Conversely, if the marriage smoothly then it will benefit his parents. Efforts to be made by community leaders and overcome the marriage of young age in Kenagarian Surantih Pesisir Selatan Regency that is less relevant to make the teenagers become free.",

      "abstract": "Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other forms of unwanted attention of a sexual nature, in a workplace or elsewhere. Legal definitions distinguish between quid pro quo sexual harassment, where putting up with these behaviors is a condition of work, and behaviors that create an intimidating, offensive, hostile environment for the victim. Its forms can be physical, verbal, gestural, visual, or graphic. Behaviors that can be perceived as sexual harassment include unwelcome (sexual) jokes, remarks with sexual connotations or about private lives, gossip, repeated requests to go out, and any form of unwanted touching or invasion of personal space, as well as sexual advances or assault.",

The World Health Organization recognized the importance of psychological well-being by defining health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not just as absence of disease or helplessness. Contrary to well-being, psychological abnormality can occur to everyone and greatly undermine day-to-day functioning. Prevalence of psychological disorders in BiH is similar to worldwide prevalence: mostly anxious and somatic disorders are present, followed by mood disorders, schizophrenia and personality disorders. The development of psychological disorders is caused by the presence of many risk and protective factors. One of the possible ways of looking at the risk and protective factors is through the developmental perspective which is presented in this paper. It is difficult to set the boundary between child / adolescent and adult psychopathology; it would actually be more useful when it would not exist in the conceptual sense. To truly understand the risks of developing psychopathology, it is necessary for theoreticians and researchers to take a look at psychological disorders through a lifelong perspective.",

      "abstract": "M ental health is defined as a state of wellbeing in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. Mental health problems may increase in specific environments where social isolation and poor quality of life are prominent. In urban settings in developing countries, the risk of mental health problems or mental disorders may be higher than in rural areas. Health inequalities between rural and urban areas are considered by many investigators because urban areas have better health statistics and consume the majority of the health budget. It is important to understand the characteristics of urban environment and provide mental health services to obtain mental well-being of the people and prevent mental problems. The causes of mental problems may include genetic abnormalities, physical disorders, problems in childhood and growing up and stressful events of life. Mental illness occurs from the interaction of multiple genes and other environmental factors such as poor family conditions, abuse, psychiatric disorders in family members, traumatic events, unsafe neighborhood, and pollution, uncomfortable living conditions (crime areas or war-torn regions). Social stressors such as poverty, financial pressures, racial and sexual discrimination or harassment, unemployment, isolation, and a lack of social support can also cause stress and lead to poor quality of life and mental problems or disorders. The urban setting is a specific area where risk factors of mental problems exist. The competitive life which is not usual in rural area pushes the people across their life span. Significant problematic behaviors are frequent in urban setting as the result of mental health problems for example: divorce, abuse, selfdestruction, suicide, drug abuse, crime, sexual problems and abortion,",

      "abstract": "Paternalistic actions are performed for the target's own benefit, i.e., for the purpose of improving or increasing her personal well-being or welfare. Some accounts of well-being imply that an agent's attitude (or lack thereof) towards an action (or its likely outcome) has a direct bearing on its welfare-value for her. Since paternalistic actions interfere with autonomy or rational self-governance, these accounts may imply that paternalistic actions cannot be overall beneficial, or else that they are always simultaneously harmful to a significant degree. Some even imply that paternalistic actions can never occur, because the autonomous choice of an end is a condition of its status as a welfare-good. This chapter evaluates several proposals of this kind, e.g., that rational self-direction, autonomous living, and the endorsement of ends are either conditions on personal benefit, or else non-instrumental welfare-goods, or else key instrumental goods. However, it is argued that there is no plausible account of personal well-being or any of the goods just mentioned that supports the claim that paternalistic action cannot succeed.",

      "abstract": "Rape is a sexual act committed against a person without consent or without explicit consent. This is a very serious form of sexual violence and violates human rights. Rape can occur in a variety of contexts, including during an intimate relationship, by someone you know, or even by a stranger. This can cause deep physical and emotional trauma to victims, as well as having far-reaching impacts on society as a whole. It is important to take steps to prevent rape and provide support to victims. Rape carried out on women or men usually causes very severe trauma to them. Usually, the person becomes uncomfortable, insecure, and afraid of meeting people. He will feel alone forever, and think about ending himself, because he thinks that he is no longer pure. Usually, rape is committed by someone or several individuals, known or unknown, who deliberately rape the victim. Rape may occur because the perpetrator likes the victim, or because the perpetrator wants revenge on the victim, or there is something else. Women are creatures of God Almighty who are very perfect, because they give birth and breastfeed. In Indonesia, there are still many cases of rape that occur against women and children. The motive may be because the perpetrator likes the victim, or the perpetrator just wants revenge on the victim, or it was planned long ago by the perpetrator. Rape against women or girls is a form of sexual violence that occurs when someone commits a sexual act against a woman without her consent. This may include vaginal, anal, or oral penetration, as well as other sexual acts carried out with violence, threats, coercion, or the woman's inability to provide valid consent. Rape against women is often a form of expression of systematic gender inequality and domination. It is important to remember that rape does not only happen to women, but can also happen to men or individuals of various other gender identities. Nevertheless, rape of women is often in the spotlight due to its high prevalence and serious impact on the well-being of women and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to continue fighting sexual violence and fighting for gender equality to create a safe and inclusive society for all individuals.",

However, this can also be a problem for each human being, such as between individuals and individuals, between individuals and groups, and also between groups and groups.

According to WHO, acts of violence are the use of violence or physical force that is carried out intentionally or contains an element of intent in the form of threats or actions against a person or group of people or society which causes injury, death, psychological harm, and developmental abnormalities or deprivation of rights. This act of violence is also an act that violates human rights because this act does not reflect the norms and values ​​that reflect human rights. One example of an act of violence that does not reflect human rights is domestic violence.

      "abstract": "Throughout history, societies have circumscribed certain forms of intimacy in the family setting. Transgression has been punished by force of ecclesiastical rules and government statutes. However, no single definition of incest is widely accepted, as the degree of kinship in which marriage is allowed and the age of consent vary. Fueled in part by the current emphasis on child abuse prevention, the reporting of incest is increasing. The perpetrator in the majority of reported cases is a male adult, and most often the victim is a young girl. Other dyads do occur and are probably under-estimated in frequency. Disturbed family relationships generate a shift in individual responsibilities and expectations that can lead to incest. A lack of spousal sexual activity is a common preceding factor. The sequelae of this breach of family integrity are significant. Frequently, the family itself is destroyed; the destruction often begins before incest occurs. The victim faces a future characterized by emotional turmoil, diminished self-esteem, impaired interpersonal relationships, and impulsive acting-out behavior. Family and individual therapy, participation in support groups, and referral for chemical dependency treatment are essential if future problems in the lives of everyone involved are to be avoided.",

Some have endured gross insensitivity, disrespect, indifference, imbalance in give-and-take, or ingratitude. Substance abuse or destructive family patterns may have compromised or even ruined what could have been so much better. Sometimes we become unusually dependent on those who have died-to the point at which some of us have merged our identities with theirs, deferred to them on almost all decisions, or allowed them to manage nearly all details of our lives. Some of us have struggled with another’s attempts to control, manipulate, dominate, or even possess us. Some of us have been abused and actually harmed physically, sexually, or psychologically.

      "abstract": "Frotteurism is a perverted sexual behaviour wherein the person tends to rub or bring about physical contact between his genitals and an unrelated female or male to derive sexual pleasure. Moreover, frotteurism is a common phenomenon among the general population which usually goes unnoticed or overlooked. Nevertheless, public frottage has legal implications in almost all countries over the world. But, when frotteurism manifests on the backdrop of psychiatric illness or as a developmental abnormality then it is worth discussing what the legal liability would be. The present case report is based on hypersexual frotteuristic behaviour manifested on the background of a concealed psychiatric illness, featuring depression and obsessive compulsive disease. The hypersexual behaviour manifested in the form of masturbation with features of frotteurism and subsequent development of depression. Nevertheless, compulsive manifestation of frotteuristic behaviour and subsequent development of morbid depression is rare. This paper describes a 12-year-old boy having unrestrained impulsive frotteurism with his peers, school mates and with his younger brother. He was conscious of the fact and feeling guilty of what he was doing but unable to restrain himself. It was followed by the development of symptoms of depression which was treated with Sertraline. Concurrent psychiatric counseling and rehabilitation measures were taken too. There was complete remission of the symptoms 6 months after the onset of treatment and without relapse thereafter. The paper discusses the differential diagnosis and management of hypersexual behaviour.",

      "title": "Bullying in School and Cyberspace",
      "abstract": "For students, bullying is a significant problem, especially in middle school: up to half of students are involved, either as a bully, a victim, or a bystander. The effects of bullying range from negligible to very severe, including individual psychological difficulties as well as consequences for criminogenic behavior. Theories to explain multidetermined bullying behavior include ecological as well as family-based approaches. Bullying must contain the following elements: unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or groups of youths who are not siblings or current dating partners that involves an observed or perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. This definition describes traditional bullying, in which a person or persons can be seen to be engaged in bullying behavior. Since the late 1990s, cyberbullying has been on the rise. Traditional bullying and cyberbullying differ in the following ways: (a) cyberbullying often means the victim does not know who the bully is; (b) cyberbullying is not a discreet incident; it can be preserved in cyberspace indefinitely; (c) anger rumination, anxiety, depression, and suicidality are more prevalent among cyberbully victims; (d) cyberbullies can exhibit decreased empathy for others relative to traditional bullies; and (e) longitudinal research has found some support that cyberbullies may develop delinquent behaviors in adulthood. Bullying affects a significant proportion of students, between 18% and 31% of students in the United States are likely to be involved in traditional bullying, whereas rates of cyberbullying involvement are close to 59%. Any participation in bullying can affect youth negatively. Being either a bully or a victim can lead to depression, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Being a perpetrator of bullying and cyberbullying may also increase the likelihood of criminal activity in young adulthood. According to the path analytic model of juvenile delinquency, it is likely that association with delinquent peers and parenting style are related to bullying behavior. Prevention and intervention programs have had some positive effects. Prevention and intervention efforts should concentrate on universal dissemination of effective strategies, including that cyberbullies are not really anonymous. Family and school-based interventions can strengthen adult support while encouraging programs that teach children to respect each other, promoting prosocial development. For traditional bullying, school climate programs in primary school have shown positive effects. Interventions for traditional bullying that are based in family therapy have shown success. Due to the novelty of cyberbullying, few intervention studies are available as yet. Efforts to prevent cyberbullying include setting up anonymous tiplines in schools and sharing up-to-date technological advances with parents so that they can implement those blocks that are available. Finally, there are no specific federal laws in the United States addressing bullying; however, federal regulations do exist to provide frameworks for anti-discrimination laws pertaining to protected classes. Although there are no explicit federal regulations that address bullying, state and local policies have been key components in addressing bullying issues. There has been some evidence that suggest that anti-bullying laws and policies in schools may decrease bullying perpetration. Countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden have passed specific laws to address bullying, while some countries apply laws created to address other infractions to include bullying.",

The attribution may of course be totally unfair and unjustified. Alternatively, it may be, as it were, enforced or imposed, by a kind of circular selfconfirming procedure. An easily identifiable sub-population credited with strong criminal proclivities may find it difficult to secure ordinary employment and may in fact be forced into criminal activities.

      "title": "Deviance as a Method of Coping",
      "abstract": "A deviant person is one who does something we would not do. Thus defined, deviance is subjective. But not all deviant conduct is culturally relative. Acts malum in se such as rape, murder, and assault are almost universally considered to be crimes. Noncriminal deviance, however, frequently exists more in the eye of the beholder than in the real world. Deviant conduct may be divided into three categories: crime, sin, and poor taste. Crime refers to those acts which are objectively and measurably harmful to the community and which cannot be tolerated by any society that wishes to continue as a stable organism. Violent crimes against the person and serious property crimes fall into this category. Sin refers to those actions which were originally prohibited by the dominant religion or religions of the community and which at various times may have been incorporated into secular law. Prostitution, gambling, drug use, alcohol consumption, and obscenity are examples of conduct that does no measurable damage to an unwilling victim; when such conduct breaks the law, it is frequently referred to as victimless crime. Poor taste refers to a whole host of social practices which are unpleasant and abrasive and which may or may not be symbolic of conduct that society may wish to prohibit. Overt public sexual practices, peculiar methods of dress, and the wearing of unpopular political symbols all fall into this category. Most deviants recognize that their conduct is personally destructive and may be socially harmful as well. Yet they continue to deviate from the socially prescribed norms because this conduct enables them to cope with the stresses that a highly organized society imposes on their personalities. Many forms of deviant conduct are tension relievers. Some create a short-lived euphoria, and some are acts of rebellion against socially pre scribed norms impossible to reach. In coping with deviance society must first look at what the deviant is attempting to tell us through his conduct. If other ways of relieving stress can be provided for him, he can be persuaded to conform. If he cannot conform and his conduct is violent, we must physically restrain him; if he is nonconforming and nonviolent, we should let him alone.",

      "abstract": "La violencia basada en género, que expresa el imbalance de poder entre hombres y mujeres, es una transgresión a los derechos humanos de las mujeres y un problema de salud pública muy antiguo y que compromete todas las sociedades del mundo. Se admite hoy en día que más de un tercio de las mujeres ha padecido violencia (psicológica, física o sexual) en algún momento de sus vidas. La violencia sexual es la versión más extrema de violencia contra la mujer y concurre usualmente con los otros dos tipos de violencia. Se puede presentar en todas las etapas de la vida y ni siquiera el embarazo constituye un factor protector. Las personas más cercanas a las víctimas (pareja actual o anterior, sus familiares o personas conocidas), generalmente con poder sobre ellas, son los perpetradores más comunes. Se puede identificar algunos factores asociados, como el alcoholismo, la ignorancia, la permisividad social, la mala relación entre las parejas, el uso de drogas y otros. Las consecuencias pueden ser inmediatas o de corto, mediano y largo plazos y se dan sobre la salud física (suicidio, homicidio, muertes derivadas de sida o por complicaciones del embarazo; lesiones leves y graves, infecciones pélvicas y de transmisión sexual, embarazos ectópicos, embarazos no deseados, abortos espontáneos o inducidos, peso bajo al nacer) y mental (depresión, ansiedad, síndrome postraumático, síndrome posviolación, trastornos del sueño, obesidad, consumo de alcohol, drogas y tabaco y conductas sexuales de riesgo, entre otras) y tiene también impacto social (costos derivados de la atención de la salud y de la atención legal, implicancias sobre la productividad y el empleo). Por las graves repercusiones que tiene la violencia sobre las mujeres y la sociedad en general, debe ser enfrentada con información, educación, trabajo con grupos de varones y mejor preparación de los servicios de salud, apoyo legal y social.",

      "title": "Multiple Discrimination and Its Consequences for the Mental Health of Ethnic Minorities",
      "abstract": "Discrimination is a violation of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims in Art. 1 the equality of all human beings without distinction as to race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, religion, age or health. International law assigns three main characteristics to discrimination: disadvantageous treatment, based on unlawful grounds, and lack of reasonable and objective justification. Thus, it must be based on an unlawful characteristic: Ethnicity, religion, national or social origin, language, physical appearance, descent, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability. A growing body of literature has recognized health disparities and has investigated the relationship between discrimination and poor health outcomes. Ethnic minority groups across the world face social and psychological challenges linked to their minority status, often involving discrimination. Furthermore, cumulative exposure to racial discrimination has incremental negative long-term effects on the mental health of ethnic minority people.Studies that examine exposure to discrimination only at one point in time may underestimate the contribution of racism to poor health. Lower patient-centered care was associated with higher perceptions of discrimination, despite experiences of continuous discrimination or discrimination experienced as different types. Further, dissatisfaction with care was associated with discrimination, particularly when experienced in various forms. These findings reinforce a need for patient-provider communication that is inclusive and eliminates perceptions of discrimination and bias, increases patient-centeredness, and improves overall clinical care. Additionally, these results stress the need for more research investigating the relationship between discrimination and outcomes in patients, as perceived discrimination manifests as a significant barrier to effective disease management.

It gives cultural and body perception and experience. The main point in defining disability and disability is to look at this phenomenon, which in general in this article we have examined four types of looks. Common looks are:That disability is a disorder caused by moral slippage or guilt of individuals or their parents, as well as a view of disability as a medical problem due to health deficiencies, and a third view of disability as a social barrier.That is, discrimination, social inactivity, economic dependence, high unemployment rates, and poor housing cause disability.....",

Former draconian and punitive laws against it have in the main been eliminated, but it remains a stigma and a heartache. In the twentieth century, suicide has become a problem for sociologists, psychiatrists, and social policymakers to solve. In past centuries, however, suicide was a subject most fit for philosophers, theologians, writers, and, as the nineteenth century progressed, physicians. What establishes itself clearly throughout is that social attitudes and public policies toward suicide, as toward other important human issues, mirror the needs and peculiar circumstances of a culture. Yet sanctions against suicide, except in highly prescribed instances, transcend cultural specificity. To the question when, if ever, is suicide permissible, Western peoples and institutions, both secular and religious, reply, never. Duty to others, to God, to society, or to all of these, virtually always overrides personal desire or reasons to commit suicide.",

      "abstract": "Our society normally regulates a certain range of activities; it is illegal to perform these activities unless one has received prior permission to do so. We require automobile operators to have licenses. We forbid people from practicing medicine, law, pharmacy, or psychiatry unless they have satisfied certain licensing requirements.\nThese general criteria for regulatory licensing can certainly be applied to parents. First, parenting is an activity potentially very harmful to children. The potential for harm is apparent: each year more than half a million children are physically abused or neglected by their parents. Many millions more are psychologically abused or neglected not given love, respect, or a sense of self-worth. The results of this maltreatment are obvious. Abused children bear the physical and psychological scars of maltreatment throughout their lives. Far too often they turn to crime. They are far more likely than others to abuse their own children. Even if these maltreated children never harm anyone, they will probably never be well-adjusted, happy adults. Therefore, parenting clearly satisfies the first criterion of activities subject to regulation.\nThis discussion is abhorrent and needs to be supplanted with a more child-centered view. Parents who hold this view may well maltreat their children. If these parents happen to treat their children well, it is only because they want to, not because they think their children deserve or have a right to good treatment. Moreover, this belief is manifestly at odds with the conviction that parents should prepare children for life as adults. Children subject to parents who perceive children in this way are likely to be adequately prepared for adulthood. Hence, to prepare children for life as adults and to protect them from maltreatment, this attitude toward children must be dislodged. As I have argued, licensing is a viable way to protect children. Furthermore, it would increase the likelihood that more children will be adequately prepared for life as adults than is now true.",

A relationship will, on the other hand, be called “closed” against outsiders so far as, according to its subjective meaning and its binding rules, participation of certain persons is excluded, limited, or subjected to conditions. Whether a relationship is open or closed may be determined traditionally, affectually, or rationally in terms of values or of expediency. It is especially likely to be closed, for rational reasons, in the following type of situation: a social relationship may provide the parties to it with opportunities for the satisfaction of spiritual or material interests, whether absolutely or instrumentally, or whether it is achieved through co-operative action or by a compromise of interests. If the participants expect that the admission of others will lead to an improvement of their situation, an improvement in degree, in kind, in the security or the value of the satisfaction, their interest will be in keeping the relationship open. If, on the other hand, their expectations are of improving their position by monopolistic tactics, their interest is in a closed relationship.",

      "title": "Domestic Violence: A Problem And How It Affects Children's Psyche",
      "abstract": "The majority of victims of domestic violence have always been women, and this pattern has persisted into the 21st century. Regardless of their age, religion, caste, or social status, women from all social backgrounds are affected by domestic abuse. Domestic abuse, however, can also afflict men, children, and the elderly in addition to women. All facets of society and demographics are impacted by domestic violence. Domestic abuse refers to a pattern of abusive behaviour done by one partner to take or maintain control over a romantic partner. It can happen in any kind of partnership. Any pattern of coercive behaviour that negatively impacts a person in an intimate partner relationship, regardless of whether it is physical, sexual, emotional, economical, psychological, or technical, is considered domestic abuse. No matter a person's ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, religion, sex, or gender identity, domestic abuse can affect them. Domestic abuse affects people from all socioeconomic backgrounds and educational degree. Intimate partners who are married, residing together, dating, or who are parents together might experience domestic violence. In both same sex and opposite partnerships, it is possible. The victims of domestic abuse, as well as their family, friends, workplace, any witnesses, and the community at large, are all significantly impacted. Domestic violence has a detrimental effect on many people, including children who endure it as they grow up. Frequent exposure to violence in the home teaches children that abuse is a normal part of life, which increases the likelihood that they will grow up to be society's next victims and abusers in addition to exposing them to a number of physical and social problems. Abuse in the home is nothing new. It has been a part of societies all around the world for a very long time. The goal of a growing initiative in the second half of the 20th century was to raise awareness of this enduring societal problem. As a result, legislation was passed by the federal and state governments to safeguard victims and hold violent offenders accountable. 1994 saw the initial passage of the Federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). It generously supports programmes to stop domestic violence. Domestic violence is a severe public . According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 26% of men and 41% of women have experienced intimate partner violence at some point in their life. All three types of abuse are mentioned in reports of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and stalking to law enforcement.",

The data from these studies seem further to indicate that this association is not a linear cause-effect relationship in either direction, but a circular or interactional relationship. Unemployment may affect mental health by acting as a precipitating factor. But, on the other hand, it is evident that the risk for the mentally disturbed to become unemployed is clearly greater than for other people. Many other factors besides unemployment and mental disorder act in this complex interaction network too. All unemployed are not similar, but such factors as age, education, domicile, family, other social ties, and personality have a great effect on the whole. Work is an important resource for mental health. Unemployment can be regarded as a risk factor because it means that the individual loses the positive and supporting elements which work has. The negative factors are (i) the lack of emotional and economic security, (ii) the perplexity of the time perspective, (iii) isolation, (iv) identity diffusion, and (v) a general sense of frustration.",

Objections to the “illness concept” may impede our vision and the range of services we develop. It is possible to agree with objectors to the illness concept that a unidimensional view is unhelpful; that explanations are often only attributions; that the construct “illness” is not needed for help to be offered, its use could undermine self‐mastery, and its misuse can breach civil fights. Learning can explain much over‐drinking. However, the concept need not imply bimodality of drinkers; the syndrome of alcohol dependence has uses and does not imply a cause; physical and mental explanations are not incompatible; genetic and biochemical research has promise. Developments in treatment are still limited, but the mysteries of the free‐will dilemma should not prevent us seeing physiological, psychological and social contributants of partners rather than rivals.",

      "title": "Brain health and value diversity: A new implementation field for values-based practice?",
      "abstract": "Brain health and value diversity: A new implementation field for values-based practice?Brain health has recently emerged as an overarching concept encompassing cognitive, sensory, social-emotional, behavioural and motor aspects of brain functioning, enabling individuals to achieve their potential for both health and wellbeing over their life course, independent of the presence or absence of disease. 1 It is contingent on a continuous, complex interplay between interconnected determinants related to physical health, healthy environments, safety and security, learning and social connection, and access to quality services.Even though responsibility for optimizing brain health can be taken at an individual level, brain health is in fact heavily influenced by determinants far beyond the control of individuals and their families.For instance, protection from abuse and maltreatment or equitable access to health services depend on interacting social, financial, and political factors that can often only be minimally influenced by individual or small group initiatives. 2,3In addition, the voice of many people, including the very young, the very old, the sick, the disadvantaged, and those who live in poverty, may not be sufficiently influential, even though the decision-making process crucially affects the brain health and quality of life for these individuals.The breadth of determinants of brain health makes brain health a terrain that is justifiably shaped by a plethora of stakeholders with highly diverse values and hence potentially conflicting interests and albeit different degrees of power.Consequently, decisionmaking in such contexts embodies a thorny process that may render the negligence of the values, viewpoints, and perspectives of those directly involved in a given decision, particularly when the individual capacity to advocate for oneself and the willingness of society and governments to act on behalf of their citizens, are low.Values-based practice (VBP) is a toolkit for balancing interests, wishes, and values in contexts characterized by diverse values, which may be valuable in decision-making related to brain health. 4The implementation of this toolkit in different fields of healthcare (e.g., occupational therapy, orthopedics, primary care, psychiatry, psychology, radiotherapy) has been proposed, and training materials for healthcare professionals have been developed. 5BP aims to include the differences in values, viewpoints, and perspectives of those directly concerned with a given decision so that communication and shared decision-making are facilitated.Based on the legacy of the Popperian open society, 5 VBP treats values in the same way that democracy treats ideas and human voices.Hence, this decision-making toolkit is neither restricted to ethical codes nor prioritizes one value over others.It also does not endorse certain values while excluding others, provided that the values in play are compatible with legal, regulatory, and bioethical frameworks.The emphasis of VBP is on good process rather than predetermined 'correct' outcomes. 6,7Respect for differences between stakeholders results in the creation of a culture of mutual responsibility and in building up a positive relationship between all those concerned, so that everyone feels a sense of ownership of the decision made. 4,6Of note, according to VBP, the perspective of the health service user or of the individuals or community seeking to protect their brain health is the ideal starting point for any decision.This approach minimizes the negligence of the views, needs, values, competencies, resources, and aspirations of those trying to optimize their brain health in contexts where powerful socioeconomic and further interests may be at stake.The 'good process' of VBP is safeguarded by ten principles. 4Four of them pertain to clinical skills and practice -awareness raising regarding the involvement of values in a given decision-making process; use of a clear reasoning strategy to explore value diversity;",

Kemampuan berkomunikasi dan penyesuaian diri yang baik dan efektif terutama sangat diperlukan oleh para remaja. Hal ini sesuai dengan salah satu tugas perkembangan masa remaja yang tersulit yaitu berhubungan dengan penyesuaian sosial. Masa remaja dikenal sebagai usia bermasalah, remaja dituntut berperilaku sesuai aturan kelompok, dimana aturan tersebut seringkali berbeda dengan cara, kebiasaan dan norma yang diterapkan oleh keluarga. Remaja harus cermat dalam membedakan yang benar dan salah. Aturan kelompok kadangkala memaksa sehingga remaja perlu berperilaku asertif untuk melindungi diri dari pergaulan yang tidak baik. Lebih dari 200 remaja perempuan meninggal setiap hari disebabkan komplikasi pengguguran, perilaku seks pranikah itu cenderung dilakukan karena pengaruh teman sebaya. Dari berbagai dampak yang ada dapat dilihat bahwa kerugian terbesar dialami remaja perempuan. Remaja perempuan kurang dapat berpikir logis disaat mendapat bujukan atau rayuan dari pacarnya, remaja perempuan juga perlu bersikap tegas terhadap bujukan atau pengaruh laki-laki untuk melakukan hubungan seks sebelum menikah. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui perbedaan asertifitas remaja ditinjau dari jenis kelamin.\r\nPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian kuantitatif. Sampel penelitian adalah remaja yang berusia antara 14-15 tahun, sedang menempuh pendidikan di tingkat SMP kelas III berjumlah 120 orang yang di ambil dengan menggunakan teknik quota sampling. Sedangkan metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah skala likert yaitu skala perilaku asertif. Pengambilan data dilakukan pada tanggal 22 - 25 Februari 2011. Adapun metode analisis yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Independent sample t-test dengan program SPSS 13.00 for windows.\r\nBerdasarkan hasil penelitian yang dilakukan, diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa ada perbedaan asertifitas remaja yang sangat signifikan ditinjau dari jenis kelamin, laki-laki (157.78) sedangkan perempuan (147.63). Hasil uji hipotesis menunjukkan t = 2.925; p = 0.004. Dengan demikian hipotesis di terima, hasil ini menunjukkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan yang sangat signifikan asertifitas remaja laki-laki dan remaja perempuan. Dimana remaja laki-laki lebih asertif daripada remaja perempuan. Sedangkan pada tiap aspeknya, berdasarkan uji t-test diperoleh bahwa pada aspek mengungkapkan perasaan positif (t = 2.296; p = 0.023) menunjukkan adanya perbedaan yang signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan dalam mengungkapkan perasaan positif. Perbedaan yang sangat signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan terdapat pada aspek afirmasi diri (t = 2.810; p = 0.006) dan aspek mengungkapkan perasaan negatif (t = 3.178; p = 0.002).",

      "title": "Factors Associated with Frequency of Gender Identity Nonaffirmation Microaggressions among Transgender Persons",
      "abstract": "As many as 45% of transgender individuals experience gender-based victimisation (GBV), including physical and sexual violence; social, workplace, and housing discrimination; and family or social rejection. In addition to overt forms of GBV, transgender individuals experience gender identity-related microaggressions: subtle, frequently-occurring aversive events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection of an individual’s gender identity. The degree to which a transgender individual is socially perceived as the gender with which they identify, sometimes referred to as passing, as well as sociodemographic factors such as annual income and race/ethnicity, have been previously linked with experiencing overt GBV. This study aimed to quantitatively assess whether self-rated degree of passing, age, annual income, and non-white race/ethnicity were associated with the frequency with which transgender individuals experience less overt identity-related victimisation in the form of gender nonaffirmation microaggressions. Among an age-diverse sample of U.S. adolescent and adult transgender persons (𝑛 = 224) who responded to 14 situational prompts of nonaffirmation microaggressions, adolescents experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions (M = 2.16, SD = 1.48). Factors significantly associated with increased average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions included lower degree of passing and lower income, while older age was associated with lower frequency of microaggressions.",

      "title": "[Psychological aspects of voluntary induced abortion among fathers drafted into military service].",
      "abstract": "This work examines the symptomatology of 4 young men recently drafted into military service in France who had negative reactions to their partner's abortions. The men ranged in age from 19-21 years. In all cases there was frank depression, accompanied or not by activity illegal in the eyes of the military (unauthorized leave) or of the common law (theft, use of drugs). The abortion was either a pretext for a rapid decompensation of a pathological personality, or it occasioned a crisis in personalities previously relatively well adapted despite immaturity, psychopathology, or weakness. The organization of the couples tended to be recent, unstable, precarious, and without a promising future either affectively or socioeconomically. Either the woman decided to seek an abortion herself and presented the father with an accomplished fact, or the couple tacitly made a joint decision to seek an abortion, in which case the subsequent illegal activity of the father tended to be more serious. Each of the men had conflictive family relationships with their fathers especially perceived as hostile and rejecting. All of the men had attempted suicide or had considered it. Induction into the army has traditionally been seen as a rite of passage to adult life, but in some cases the emotional distances it causes and the socioeconomic difficulties it aggravates prevent the man from undertaking the responsibilities of fatherhood. In these cases it is as if social maturity can be acquired only at the expense of fatherhood; the 2 states cannot coexist. Frustration and sacrifice of fatherhood nevertheless may occasion loss of the social maturity stemming from military service. The abortion is followed by guilt, psychic suffering, and behavioral problems leading to expulsion from the military. On the symbolic level the man does not become either man or father. Another point is that depression, anxiety, and guilt are an affective expression of the idea of death; the embryo is thought of as an infant when in fact it is only potentially an infant. On the unconscious level the father may identify with the aborted fetus in the belief that his own parents may have wanted to destroy him. The abortion may also contain a suicidal element to the extent that the fetus represents a prolongation of the parent. The anxiety and guilt of the father find expression also in auto- and heteroaggressive acts. Through a mechanism of projection, responsibility of the army is substituted for that of the individual.",

If long hospitalization is required, and if during that time the family redistributes functionsi.e., closes ranks, his or her return can be viewed as a form of accession.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\r\nSuicide is a major public health concern for older adults, who have higher rates of completed suicide than any other age group in most countries of the world. With older men are at greatest risk, near by equal incidence of attempted and completed suicide. Lot of variables in different domains (mental, physical, and social) have been correlated with Self directed violence in older adults. Affective disorder is most powerful independent risk factor for suicide in elders. Other mental illnesses play less of a role. Social ties and their disruption are significantly and independently associated with risk for suicide in later life, relationships between which may be moderated by a rigid, anxious, and obsessional personality style. Stressful life events, such as family conflicts, separation, bereavement, somatic illness and financial problems are common antecedents of suicide.\r\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To estimate multi-dimensional risk factor for suicidal self directed violence in elderly.\r\n2. To compare the risk factors between subjects with suicidal self directed violence and that of age and sex matched controls (with no history of suicidal self directed violence).\r\nMATRERIALS AND METHOD:\r\nThe current study was a case control study, conducted at, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Chennai. The cases reporting to the casualty with self-directed violence, satisfying inclusion criteria after their informed written consent included in the study. Equal number of age and sex matched controls were included for comparison .Details were collected according to pre decided protocol in four domains socio-demographic variables, psychiatric and mental illness variable, psychological variables and sociological, using standard and validated questionnaire. Collected data were analysed using SPSS version 20 parametric variables were compared using independent –t test, non –parametric variables using chi-square test followed by univariate and multivariate regression analysis.\r\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION:\r\nImportant risk factors obtained after the multivariate analysis followed by hierarchical linear logistic regression are – being single, male gender, with history of mental illness previous suicidal behavior, use of alcohol, suffering from physical illness with associated functional impairment and disability, psychologically impulsive, with presence of significant score on depression and hopelessness, criticism, negative life event and poor social support.",

      "abstract": "Mobbing represents humiliation, ridiculing, spying and psychological terror that happens at the work place. This behavioral pattern happens periodically and indicates how one person treats the other, in which one person is constantly mistreated and humiliated in an attempt to jeopardize his or her reputation, dignity and self-respect. The variety of mobbing indicate mobbing focused on how subordinate person treats superior person and the other way around which is actually more common in practice. Mobbing represents the disorderly patterns in interpersonal relationships at the work place, without justified reason or any meaning, has negative consequences on the subordinate person and his or her family, institution that he or she is a part of and wider community. Most often the victims of mobbing are the individuals who are very unique in their way of thinking and logic, they are the best and the most educated people, and usually they represent the threat and the competition to their colleagues. Most commonly they could be the individuals that face retirement, but sometimes even the most ambitious young people or people with different sexual orientation. Aside from the mere causes of mobbing, the most important question is the consequences mobbing has on an individual. Most commonly these consequences are disruptions in the behaviour and mood, but even more often somatic symptoms when the individuals feel lost in time and space, have numerous psychological disorders that reflects on many examples in practice. We think that the effects or mobbing are permanent and incomprehensible. Physical abuse is the easiest to detect and prove, but there is also a 'silent' mobbing, the one that humiliates the dignity of employees and destroys their psyche. That example of mobbing is hardest to detect even though it's consequences are incomprehensible.",

Today’s society is afraid of age-related problems and has various attempts to combat the effects of old age on the human body and mind. These prejudices have their source in rational or irrational fear. Rational fear is related to the deterioration of health, loneliness, loss of loved ones and the decline of social status can be intensified by negative stereotypes about the elderly. Irrational fear is related to physical changes, loss of masculinity or femininity, and the observation of mental incompetence.",

      "abstract": "Addiction, which is one of the major problems of society and is spreading severely day by day, is considered a complex process where an individual develops an uncontrollable desire for a substance or behavior, continues this desire, and has difficulty ending it despite both physical and psychological harm. Food addiction is a type of addiction where individuals consume food not only to meet their physiological needs but also uncontrollably for emotional and psychological satisfaction. Individuals with food addiction tend to eat to cope with emotional states such as stress, anxiety, and depression, leading to unhealthy eating habits and weight problems. In such addictions, the treatment process requires addressing not only the improvement of physical symptoms but also the emotional and psychological factors that trigger the addiction. Although food addiction usually arises from depression or other psychological disorders, in some cases, individuals may feel the need to eat to feel better after experiencing abuse. This situation can become uncontrollable, leading to food addiction, which negatively affects both the mental and physical health of individuals. This study is a case study of a 41-year-old woman named S.A., who developed food addiction as a result of sexual abuse by her parent at the age of 13. The gradual progression of the abuse and the subsequent development of food addiction are examined in detail, along with the effects of EMDR and CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) on overcoming the food addiction.",

While experiences that may be associated with age, including changes in roles and social networks, losses and health challenges, may require adaptation of aspects of personality, personality across the lifespan fundamentally influences how ageing is experienced. There are indications that extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness show reduced levels in later life, but people’s rank order on personality traits remains stable. Development continues into later life, but builds on earlier experiences and ways of coping. Personality resources such as self-esteem, perceived control, self-efficacy, and resilience shape the person’s response to adversity in later life, enabling older people to maintain high levels of well-being, despite the challenges. Dementia, the ultimate challenge, is accompanied by personality change, with raised neuroticism and lowered conscientiousness both predicting its onset and accompanying its course. Pre-morbid personality does also appear to have some influence on behavioural problems experienced.",

Approximately half the children in each group heard verbal descriptions of the same events rather than observing them on videotape. No differences were found between aggressive boys and non-aggressive boys, suggesting that aggressive perceivers do not necessarily “project” their own characteristics onto others. However, learning disabled boys both aggressive and non-aggressive, found all scenes more unfriendly. Differences in responses to videotapes and to verbal descriptions alone suggest that conclusions about social perceptions obtained from one mode of stimulus presentation may not generalize to other modes or to life situations.",

      "abstract": "Sociologists tend to define deviance in one of two ways: by the negative reactions an act, the expression of a belief, or a physical characteristic generates, or by the violation of the norms or the rules that prevail in a given society or group. Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake &amp; Kingsley 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviance is a formal violation of the rules.",

Social practices may exert their effects di rectly on the organism and its physical capacities or may operate primarily through psychological processes which are linked to the maintenance of bodily equilibriums. In either instance, these effects tend to be nonspecific as to disease. Social status, variations in life styles, adaptation to new or stressful situations, work group structure, and family patterns have been found to be associated with differences in the in cidence of a variety of diseases.

      "title": "Emotional Neglect and it's Impact Upon the Self",
      "abstract": "Emotional neglect is one of the five sub-types of childhood mistreatment that has been classified by practitioners in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and education. The other four are sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and physical neglect. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the least studied area from these five despite being commonly cited by research as being the most likely to occur. Contrary to what one might guess, numerous studies have in fact reported that emotional neglect can have an even greater negative impact upon individuals than the other types of mistreatment, particularly in regards to how individuals view themselves and their place in the world. Emotional neglect can broadly be defined as repeated and consistent caregiver-child interactions that are characterized by emotional unavailability, withdrawal, lack of reciprocity, disinterest or disengagement which lead to the child feeling that s/he is worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another's needs. Previous research has published findings strongly associating childhood emotional neglect with a range of cognitive and behavioral outcomes including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, low self-compassion, shame, guilt, sexually risky behavior, self-destructive behavior, negative schemas, poor emotional regulation, Machiavellianism and so on. Given what we know in relation to the sheer importance of the interactions between primary caregivers and the child, namely by way of Bowlby's attachment theory, it is unsurprising to find that emotional neglect has many detrimental consequences. The reasons for emotional neglect can be numerous. One of the more common reasons behind it include it being passed on from generation to generation (as is also often the case with other types of abuse/neglect); indeed, social learning theory would support the idea that we take a lot of our parenting skills and styles directly from our own parents, even if we perceive them to be negative. Another source may be familial adversity, such as poverty, living within a conflict, or living during a time of persecution. Emotional neglect may also ensue due to the sickness of a sibling or parent, as the physically sick family member often can receive all attention and emotional capital of the family unit. Parental drug or alcohol abuse would place a child at risk of experiencing emotional neglect as would the seemingly more benign yet often just as threatening driven parental styles within which all love is contingent upon meeting pre-set academic or, later in life, professional goals. In the context of Qatar, it is also worth noting that emotional neglect often occurs within family units within which material wealth is abundant, however there is physical or psychological distance between the child and the primary caregiver, say due to a large number of siblings, half-siblings or maid/nursing staff being employed to take on child-rearing duties. Our emotional development, and being raised within a context in which we feel loved and cared for, is vital to the healthy development of the self. Accordingly, I have been looking at how emotional neglect impacts upon the self, that part of us that is believed to be the source of our consciousness and the core of our being. Two specific aspects of the self which I intend to include in my research are self-esteem and memory recall. Both of these areas have not been looked at in the context of emotional neglect research yet both may hold valuable findings that will then allow practitioners to be able to design interventions that will aide individuals in overcoming their emotional neglect. This will also be the first reported study that has used qualitative interviews to assess the impact of emotional neglect. This was also a key for me; through all the research I had reviewed, the emotion in emotional neglect was not being conveyed in the numbers and the statistics. Being a student of science though I know the value of these constructs and it was with both of these ideas in mind that I decided to use mixed methods for this doctorate study. This Ph.D. is currently being carried out by me at Queen's University Belfast, and is being supervised by, Dr Teresa Rushe.",

La non-recidive qui est le signe de la desistance ne suffit donc pas pour qu’on puisse parler de resilience car la conformite normative peut etre simplement un abandon adaptatif au meme titre que la delinquance pouvait l’etre. Meme si une delinquance violente peut etre le fruit d’un moi faible, d’une incapacite a tolerer les frustrations ou a controler les ecluses du passe, une grande part de la delinquance repose sur des mecanismes adaptatifs adequats quand bien meme ils sont moralement ou juridiquement inacceptables. Pour que la resilience secondaire se mette en place il nous semble que des mecanismes supplementaires tels que la sublimation ou un sursaut narcissique engendre un investissement d’objet hors soi. Plusieurs cas nous montrent que ces personnes sorties de la toxicomanie ou de carrieres delinquantes plus ou moins severes se sont appuyees sur un etayage narcissique externe ou sur des mecanismes de defense tournes vers la generativite pour entreprendre des actions sociales altruistes ou des activites educatives ou theâtrales qui qualifient la resilience secondaire.",

      "abstract": "The concept of sexual harassment, in its modern understanding, is a relatively new one, dating from the 1970s onwards; although other related concepts have existed prior to this in many cultures. “Sexual Harassment” means behavior, including physical contact, advances, and comments in person, through an intermediary, and/or via phone, text message, email, social media, or other electronic medium, that is unwelcome; based on sex or gender stereotypes; and is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with a person's academic performance, employment or equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from college or University programs or activities or by creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working or educational environment. Students at academic institutions often sexually harass others by calling them “fag, ” “homo, ” “Hey, babe, ” “Hot stuff, ” or “Big stud” or other degrading terms that refer to sexual orientation. Additional types of sexual harassment include students starting or spreading sexual rumors, writing sexual graffiti on bathroom walls, sending crude e-mails or letters, and displaying sexual drawings or pornography. A person in a position of power may request sexual favors in return for a starting position on a college team, a higher grade, or access to a popular club or peer group. Individuals who experience sexual harassment feel fearful, intimidated, manipulated, and overpowered.",

Whilst some youngsters misleadingly look as if they are 17 and sexually mature, others can almost literally be half their size and still be very much children in all respects. Physically mature 12-year-old girls may have to cope with confusing sexual feelings and experiences for which they privately feel emotionally unready, despite their apparent outward sophistication. Small 14-year-old boys who are late developers suffer agonies wondering if their bodies will ever change into those of men. The sense of being unable to control the body's physical destiny can bring enormous anxiety, frustration, anger, and distress, as acne takes a hold or breasts become too obvious a feature on a shy girl's body. This is the age of puberty, which can be protracted or rapid, during which young adolescents reach sexual maturity.",

      "abstract": "Abuse is on the significant rise in the world and affects all populations of people equally. Abuse is the use of strenght and power on another person or group, resulting in negative consequences for the victim. As such, violence is a major problem in society, which nurses often encounter. A nurse is competent to recognize forms and types of violence, as well as victims and abusers. Abuse is a complicated phenomenon. It can be active, in the form of physical, sexual or psychological abuse of different intensity, or passive, in the form of neglect. Violence can be directed directly or indirectly. Violence occurred throughout the entire history of mankind. In the past, children and women were considered property by their fathers and husbands. Such behavior was acceptable at that time.There are various theories about the source of violence. Biological theories include neuropsychological, biochemical and genetic influences, and brain disorders. As for the psychological ones, there are psychodynamic theories and theories of learning. One of the sociocultorological theory is related to social influence. Data related to intimate partner abuse, child abuse and neglect, and sexual assault are useful in the use of health care process. Information on the characteristics of both victim and the abuser may be used as background knowledge in designing plans of care for clients who are victims of abuse. Physical abuse between domestic partners may be known as spouse abuse or relationship abuse. Women often get stuck in the cycle of battering, and most often stay in such a relationship because they fear for their own life or the lives of their children. The effects of child maltrearment are usually deep and longlasting, because children are vulnerable and powerless. Poor behavior towards children includes physical and emotional abuse or neglect, or sexual abuse. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of incest. Adults who have survived incest during their lives carry their scars for the rest of the life, and such childhood events can affect their present lives. In recent decades, International organizations warn people of an increasing number of violence against the elderly. Violence of a child over his/her parent is also an act with which a child intimidates and controls a parent, and can be in the form of physical, emotional, material violence and neglect. It can also lead to a high level of stress and is considered to be a risk factor for early death. Any type of sexual act in which an individual is threatened coerced or forced to do against his/her own will is considered to be sexual abuse. Sexual abuse include rape, which implies expression of power and domination, and some of its forms are acquaintance rape, marital rape and statutory rape. Two emotional response patterns for victims can be identified within a couple hours of rape. Those are: the expressed response pattern and the controlled response pattern. Some victims develop a compounded rape reaction while others develop the silent reaction. Health care management is an activity that is coordinated, and its purpose is to provide the quality health care to a sick or healthy individual. The basic management functions are planning, organization, management and control. They include human, financial, material and IT resources in an organizational environment. Nursing diagnosis is based on the data collected during the assessment phase and on background knowledge regarding predisposing factors for the situation. For assessing the outcomes in the care of victim of abuse, criteria for a sexually injured and physically injured patient and abused children may be used. A care plan for abuseed victims and nursing diagnosis was presented together with the outcomes criteria, appropriate nursing interventions, and rationales for each. There is also an innovative approach to planning and organizing nursing care. It is mapping the concept of care as a strategy of teaching and learning in the form of a diagram. Evaluation of nursing actions to assist victims of abuse must be considered on both a short- and a longterm basis. Among the treatments, crisis intervention, safe house or shelter and family treatment are mentioned.",

He claims to remember living in a certain place, doing certain things, being with certain people, and so on. It is then found that these memory claims fit the life of a person who died shortly before the child was born. The accuracy of the memory claims is striking and there seems to be no possible normal explanation of this. The child also has certain character traits, interests and skills which correspond closely to those of the one who died; and, perhaps, a physical characteristic, such as a birthmark or wound, which closely resembles a characteristic of the earlier individual.",

Service members have histories leading up to a suicide analogous to those among civilians. However, separations from families, deployments, combat or other trauma, command climate, and medical and psychological injuries are also stressors and may be linked to additional risks related to substance abuse, sexual dysfunction, domestic violence, lifestyle disagreements, or secretive thoughts and behaviors, which distance couples and add to disintegration of the supportive dyad the relationship could provide. Loss of vital social supports impacts resilience and facilitates a mindset enabling suicidal or other harmful thoughts and actions. Therefore, prevention programs that build, maintain, and sustain resilience are critical, as is availability of mental health clinicians trained to address relationship issues.",

      "title": "SOME APPLICATIONS OF DELINQUENCY THEORY TO CHILDHOOD ACCIDENTS",
      "abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed an increasing recognition on the part of the physician and the behavioral scientist that the state of a person's health—indeed, even his likelihood of surviving infancy or of being institutionalized for mental illness-is closely related to his social status and to the social, political, economic, and cultural characteristics of his community, his state, and his nation. With the growth of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, such \"purely biological\" phenomena as infant mortality, mental illness, malnutrition, and venereal disease have come to concern the sociologist and the anthropologist as strongly as they have the physician and the epidemiologist. Accidental injury and death, however, have to a large extent remained outside the sphere of interdisciplinary scrutiny. One reason for this neglect stems from the fact that data on accidental injury are so much less reliable than other health data as to be virtually unusable. Perhaps another reason is that the concept of an accident as an \"act of God\" persists in the minds of otherwise sophisticated persons—and \"acts of God\" seem somehow unrelated to the social and cultural environment in which they occur. Regardless of the reasons, however, the fact remains that, although a good deal is known about the socioeconomic and cultural conditions that influence the infant mortality rate, mental illness, and cardiovascular accidents, very little is known about the relationship between social conditions and the incidence of accidental injury and death. The following paper does nothing to advance our knowledge of this relationship. But it points out the gaps in our present knowledge, warns against pitfalls that are more familiar to behavioral than to medical scientists, and pleads for the application of sound sociological theory to a problem which is as much social as it is medical.",

      "abstract": "Research on casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) has increased in the last decade; however, there is no consensus about the scope and definition of CSREs. To describe the main forms of CSREs, a latent profile analysis was performed on single and sexually active men and women aged from 18 to 30 years old who described their last casual sexual experience. Five profiles were identified: 1) the one-time sexual encounter; 2) the ex-romantic partnership, in which one still has sexual contact after ending their romantic relationship; 3) the mostly about sex partnership, in which contacts are primarily sexual, whether or not a friendship exists; 4) the intimate and sexual partnership, a hybrid of friend and romantic partner with whom one has frequent sexual and social interactions without commitment or intent to form a couple; 5) the friendship first partnership, a friendship to which sex is added, where social activities and friendly interactions dominate. Participants across profiles differed according to the number of sexual partners in the past year, their intention of having other sexual contacts with the partner, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the most recent sexual encounter with their partner and their type of sexual exclusivity agreement. This research contributes to a better description and understanding of CSREs among young adults and to further specifying its area of investigation.",

It accomplishes this by (1) situating ageism in historical, psychological, global, epidemiological and health systems contexts; (2) distinguishing implicit and explicit forms of ageism and ethical arguments supporting age discrimination; (3) considering how ageism intersects with ableism, sex‐based discrimination, heterosexism, racism and midlife bias and (4) exploring evidence‐based strategies for combatting ageism. Key Concepts Ageism is negative stereotyping based on age. In wealthier nations, ageism is more frequently directed against older adults. In poorer nations, ageism is more often directed toward younger people. Ageism intersects with other forms of bias, such as ableism, gender-based bias, heterosexism, racism, and midlife bias. Age discrimination or favoring an individual or group based on age is sometimes defended on ethical grounds, such as utilitarian arguments designed to show that older people produce less return on investment or non-utilitarian arguments that after a certain age an individual has lived a fair number of innings.",

      "abstract": "My experience with borderline patients spans 23 years and five continents, and includes some 500 borderlines I have treated, supervised, followed up, known in an administrative capacity on an inpatient unit, or seen in consultation. The habitual self–mutilators I have seen have been predominantly females between the ages of 15 and 40. In the majority, constitutional and environmental factors have interacted in such a way as not to lend support to an either/or interpretation regarding etiology. Where only one causative factor seems to be operative, it has more often been the environmental. In the latter instance, the family environment has generally been far worse than \"unfavorable\": abuse, physical or sexual (or both), has been the order of the day–often in ways that merit characterization as \"grotesque\" or \"inhuman\" (Grunebaum & Klerman. 1967). The timing of the self–mutilative acts coincides with the paramenstrual (i.e. just before or just during) part of the cycle in many instances, but there appear to be equally many instances where the immediate precipitating factor occurred randomly in relation to the menses and took the form of an abrupt loss (rejection in a love relationship; therapists' vacation, etc.).",

Method: A qualitative study based on a sample of 16 self-neglecting elders. Data collection was performed through in-depth semi-structured interviews, followed by content analysis. Findings: Four major themes emerged from the older participants: “I was unlucky:” a life course of suffering; “That's the way it is:” self-neglect as a routine of life; “They tell me that I'm disabled:” old age as exposing situations of self-neglect; “My empire:” how do I perceive my old age. Conclusions: Self-neglect is not necessarily an issue of old age, but is related to the person's life history. Self-neglect as a way of life accompanied the participants into old age, but it was not originated or created there.

      "title": "Nursing care of the attention-seeking patient",
      "abstract": "There are some people who simply thrive on being the centre of attention. Such people often have a whole range of accompanying personality problems which may include egocentricity, exhibitionism, suggestibility, superficiality and a tendency to overdramatise things. Consequently the person usually has poor interpersonal relationships, little consideration for other people and an inability to tolerate frustration. There may be angry outbursts particularly if the person does not get his own way. Mood fluctuations can mean that the person is crying one moment and laughing the next. While such behaviour is of course possible in either sex, the literature points to a higher incidence among females. Such females frequently dress and act seductively in relation to males. Heavy makeup is often worn and manipulation is quite common. Such people have generally suffered from some kind of emotional deprivation during formative years. Present behaviour is unconsciously motivated by anxiety and a desire to be loved and cared for. The individual may have been denied the opportunity to experience feelings of security and consistency during the process of growing up. Unfortunately for the person concerned, attention-seeking behaviour often arouses negative feelings in others.",

      "abstract": "Empirical research, clinical experience, and greater sophistication about the interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors have produced marked changes in the appreciation of the importance of sexuality in older persons. An earlier view linking sex exclusively with reproductive function has given way to a holistic view of sex as vital to self-concept, the maintenance of healthy interpersonal relationships, and a sense of integrity. Older adults often have difficulty communicating sexual problems, concerns, and questions because of their conflicting attitudes and perceptions. Sexual problems often are presented covertly, expressed in vague terms, or masked by embarrassment. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of covert sexual dysfunctions, clear about their own attitudes and expectations to avoid stereotyping the elderly, and knowledgeable about pharmacological, organic, and psychosocial bases of sexual problems in older patients.",

      "abstract": "It is only with great diffidence that the following considerations on a difficult subject are put forward in the hope of being of possible assistance to others. By unbelief is meant the initial reluctance to accept the doctrines of Christianity as well as the disinclination to retain them that often comes upon those who devote themselves to an intellectual life. This unbelief occurs especially during the formative period, usually, but not necessarily, the years spent by young people at a university, or the time immediately following. The purpose of this essay is to try to isolate the various elements in modern life that tend to disturb settled faith in Christianity, and very briefly to indicate some way of trying to counteract them. Many of the causes are common to all periods of history, some are proper to our own age or have unusual strength now. This account does not pretend to be more than a limited and partial sketch. Behind every problem of modern instability there lies, first, a fundamental insecurity in social life, affecting all of us in many and sometimes unsuspected ways. This insecurity is manifested in the multiplicity and diversity of moral and political, personal and emotional standards all round ; these react in their turn to make more acute the basic insecurity in the soul—it may sometimes amount to a positive fear of life.",

HIV/AIDS – and the complex issues it represents – challenges our ability to reason and amplifies existing inequalities prejudices and human rights abuses. Individuals and communities already stereotyped stigmatised and disadvantaged are further marginalized by the fear ignorance and intolerance generated by HIV/AIDS. stigma is a real or perceived negative response to a person or persons by individuals communities or societies. It is characterized by rejection denial discrediting disregarding underrating and social distance. It frequently leads to discrimination and violation of human rights. HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination pose a serious threat to the basic human rights for all people infected affected or associated with the disease.

      "abstract": "Abstract Male suicide rates represent a public health crisis. In almost every country, more men die by suicide than women and suicide is a leading cause of death for men in the United States and the United Kingdom. Evidence suggests that men are less likely than women to access professional support for suicidal distress. Ensuring more men access support is a critical component of suicide prevention. This study explores responses from 725 men, worldwide, who have attempted suicide or have had thoughts of suicide in the last year, to an open-text question about the barriers they experience to accessing professional support. Using a thematic analysis, results reveal the multifaceted barriers some men experience regarding a lack of motivation, a lack of psychological capability, and/or a lack of physical/social opportunity to access support. Findings suggest that many men have sought support but had negative experiences and that many others want help but cannot access it. Barriers include prohibitive costs and waiting times; potential costs to identity, autonomy, relationships and future life opportunities; a lack of perceived psychological capability; a lack of belief in the utility of services and a mistrust of mental health professionals. Findings suggest the importance of examining the role of male gender in male help-seeking behaviours. We suggest 23 recommendations for services and public health messaging to increase men's help-seeking behaviours.",

It is a well‐evidenced fact that most criminal careers start in early adolescence and end in the late twenties regardless of whether or not individuals have been processed through the criminal justice system. Maturational, structural, and interactionist desistance theories attempt to explain why and how desistance occurs. Maturational desistance theories perceive offending as an inevitable part of youth's transition into adulthood. Structural desistance theories explain desistance through key life‐events that provide for improved social bonding with others; and interactionist desistance theories see a change in offenders' narrative identity, which is triggered by certain life‐events, as the cause of desistance. Desistance research and related concepts are still evolving, but heir theoretical implications for the criminal justice system and intervention policies are already evident.",

      "abstract": "According to the latest results of Croatian Institute of Public Health, there are more and more children and young adults who are diagnosed with behavioral or mental disorders. Today, personality disorders in adolescence are in the focus, they are important health problem because those problems reflect on families and society in general. Last decades, some important scientific researches on personality disorders in adolescence are present. Adolescence is the period of maturing where the child prepares himself/herself for adulthood; it is the period of turbulence, emotional ambivalences and intensive changes in physical, psychic, emotional, cognitive and sexual development. Numerous risks, to which young people are exposed to, can interfere with normal transition through that period and stimulate occurrence of certain disorder in the mental health of adolescence. Personality disorder is the condition where behavior and experience stand out from habitually and normal behavior; it is not adapted; it interferes with normal functioning of a young adult and it is not justified with the situation where the young person find himself/herself. The cause of disorder is interpreted as the combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risky environmental factors in the childhood take big part in its origin and development of personality disorders. There is a big vigilance in diagnosis of personality disorder in adolescence, because the fact that psychophysical development of a young adult is not finished yet, symptoms of a certain personality disorders must be present for at least one year. We distinguish several types of personality disorders that can be recognized by certain characteristics. Personality disorders are conditions; they are not mental illnesses, but if the symptoms are not recognized on time and the young person does not protect himself/herself from the risky situations and enviornment, peronality disorders can develop in that direction. The key point in the treatment of personality disorders is the early identification of the problem, setting the correct diagnosis and individual approach in choosing of methods of treatment. Psychotherapy is the most common type of treatment, in which cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis and group psychotherapy are most used. Which one will be used, depends on the assessment that best suits the person with personality disorder. In the program of the mental health protection of the youth, that are introduced on the national level, series of measuers and acitivites are pursued and directed towards the promotion and advancement of mental health, early recognition of difficulties and disorders in mental functioning, and work with high-risk children and youth. The approach is interdisciplinary, teachers and professional associates play the key role in those activities in educational institutions. Their education, consultation and permanent specialization are very important.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality and sensuality contribute to a person's self-concept, which influences self-esteem and relationships with others throughout life. There are many myths surrounding ageing and sexuality fuelled by assumptions that libido and sexual needs decline along with the loss of culturally valued signs of beauty or handsomeness. By 75–85 years of age, only one-quarter of the population is sexually active; the reasons for this are many and include psychosocial factors such as loss of a partner, age-related physiological changes and illness. In older women, the major problems are reduced libido, poor lubrication and inability to climax. In males, erectile dysfunction is the central problem. Health problems are the major reason for a decline in sexuality with ageing. Drugs for the management of erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) and new delivery systems to treat low libido (patches, nasal, gels, injections of testosterone) are revolutionizing sexuality in older persons. There is increased awareness of the special needs of the older homosexual. Paraphilias are life-long and do not necessarily disappear with ageing. Management of inappropriate and aggressive sexual behaviours in older persons with dementia is a major problem.",

      "title": "Risking your health: causes, consequences, and interventions to prevent risky behaviors",
      "abstract": "Behaviors that pose risks for an individual’s health and that also represent important threats for public health, such as drug use, smoking, alcohol, unhealthy eating causing obesity, and unsafe sex, are highly prevalent in low income countries, even though they are traditionally associated with richer countries. Individual choices are an important part of the risky behaviors. Risking Your Health: Causes, Consequences, and Interventions to Prevent Risky Behaviors explore how those choices are formed and what are their consequences. Why do people engage in risky behaviors? Many different explanations have been proposed by psychology, sociology, economics or public health. One trait common to all these behaviors is that there is a disconnect – a function of both delay and uncertainty - between the pleasure or satisfaction provided by them and their consequences. Another characteristic of risky behaviors is that they rarely occur in isolation. Peer-pressure, parental influences, networks and social norms often play an important role in initiating, continuing, or quitting those behaviors. Even if they might often be the first to suffer, the consequences of risky behaviors are also rarely limited to the individuals engaging in them. In certain cases, such as second-hand smoking or HIV transmission, the link is direct. In other cases, the link is less direct but not necessarily less real: the long term health consequences of many of these behaviors are costly to treat and could stretch households’ finances and worsen poverty. Finally, these risky behaviors have consequences for society as a whole since they often trigger a non-trivial amount of public health expenditures and lead to declines in aggregate productivity through premature death and morbidity. Changing behaviors is tricky -- public health interventions via legislation with strong enforcement mechanisms can be more effective than simple communication campaigns informing consumers about the risks associated with certain behaviors, since translating knowledge into concrete changes in behavior seems to be hard to achieve. Economic mechanisms such as taxes (especially on alcohol and tobacco products), subsidies (such as free condoms), and conditional/unconditional cash transfers are also used to reduce risky behaviors (for example in HIV prevention). Of great interest to policy makers, academics and practitioners, this book assesses the efficiency of those interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of behaviors that endanger health.",

      "title": "Marginalization through social ostracism: Effects of being ignored and excluded",
      "abstract": "Humans rely on social interactions with others to fulfill fundamental social, psychological, and survival needs. These interactions provide basic survival needs for mating, food, and protection, but also provide the higher-order socioeconomic advantages of cooperation and reciprocity. Perhaps most importantly, however, social interactions provide individuals with a sense of belonging and recognition from their mates. Not all social interactions are pleasant, yet they still provide a sense of recognition, and in some cases belonging. For instance, aversive forms of interpersonal interaction such as bullying and overt forms of rejection still provide the individual with a sense of recognition and importance. Others must go out of their ways to bully, to overtly reject, and this expended effort alone is substantiation that one deserves recognition. However, another aversive interpersonal behavior deprives the individual of the sense of recognition and meaning: ostracism. We define ostracism as being ignored and excluded (Williams, 1997, 2001, 2007, 2009). Ostracism can occur through the physical banishment or exile of an individual or group to venues that are separate from the others. In this sense, extreme forms of segregation could be viewed as physical ostracism. Ostracism can also occur without physical separation. When society's actions communicate to individuals or groups that they are psychologically invisible and inaudible to the larger society, they become socially ostracized. By being marginalized in this way, they have no measurable impact on their society. They are not recognized, nor do they have voice.",

      "abstract": "2 opposing stereotyped views of adolescence regard it as either a transitional stage marked by tumult which will be outgrown and which thus requires little societal attention or as a troubled time marked by unwed preganancy educational failure rising rates of arrest and running away and suicide. Several widely believed myths about adolescents limit our ability to understand them: the myths that adolescence is a pathological time of life; that adolescents are a homogeneous group; that adolescents are children; that growth is continuous uniform and synchronous; that adolescence is transitional. Adolescent needs result from their biological and socioemotional developmental tasks. Individuation forming commitments separation and outgrowing characteristic forms of egocentrism are among the socioemotional tasks. Cognitive development in adolescence involves appearance of the ability to think in abstractions. Most adolescents are deeply involved with 2 social institutions the family and the school. Other services for adolescents are frequently uncoordinated and scarce despite the fact that adolescents are extremely vulnerable to positive influences.",

      "abstract": "An Orientation to Conflict Conflict is like sex: it is an important and pervasive aspect of life. It should be enjoyed and should occur with a reasonable degree of frequency, and after a conflict is over the people involved should feel better than they did before. Some psychiatrists and social scientists have given conflict a bad reputation by linking it with psychopathology, social disorder, and war. Conflict can be dysfunctional, but it also can be productive. It has many positive functions, including preventing stagnation and stimulating interest and curiosity. It is the medium through which problems can be aired and solutions developed. It is the root of personal and social change. The practical and scientific issue is not how to eliminate or prevent conflict but rather how to have lively controversy rather than deadly quarrels. A conflict exists whenever incompatible activities occur. The incompatible actions may originate in one person, group, or nation (intrapersonal, intragroup, or intranational) or they may reflect incompatible actions of two or more persons, groups, or nations (interpersonal, intergroup, or international). An action that is incompatible with another action prevents, obstructs, interferes, injures, or in some way makes the latter less likely or effective. A potential conflict exists when the parties involved perceive themselves to have incompatible values, interests, goals, needs, or beliefs.",

Any disturbance in one of the components can be a disaster in sexual life. Erectile dysfunction is a disability to get an erection or to maintain the erection well enough for a sexual intercourse, which persists or recurs at least three months conse-cutively due to either psychogenic or organic disturbances, or both. Some psychogenic dis-turbances especially depression, anxiety, and relational distress, play some important roles in ED. Besides that, aging, low testoteron level, physical diseases, and some certain medicines have to be included. Key words: erection, erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulus, depression. Abstract: Fungsi seksual yang normal merupakan suatu proses biopsikososial yang berkaitan langsung dengan kualitas hidup. Adanya gangguan pada salah satu komponen dapat menjadi malapetaka bagi kehidupan seksual. Disfungsi ereksi dapat dedefinisikan sebagai suatu keti-dakmampuan untuk ereksi atau mempertahankan ereksi yang cukup untuk melakukan hu-bungan seksual yang memuaskan, yang menetap atau berulang paling tidak selama tiga bulan berturut-turut. Gangguan psikogenik khususnya sindroma depresi, ankietas, dan distres relasional berperan penting dalam hal terjadinya disfungsi ereksi.

      "title": "Foreword",
      "abstract": "For over 30 years, people with disabilities have called for the elimination of barriers to their full participation in society. 1 Many barriers affect the likelihood that persons with disabilities will lead healthy lives. The idea that persons with disabilities are capable of living healthy lives has not been obvious in most health science literature; the subject is focused on and written by persons with disabilities and is also present to some extent in the social science literature. Instead, the emphasis of health science literature has been on disability as a medical pathology with an emphasis on cure and/or rehabilitation. The purpose of this issue is to encourage discourse on barriers within the health care arena to inspire new approaches to the study of such barriers and the elimination of them. Family and community health professionals should remain aware that health is an achievable state for many persons with disabilities. Evidence suggests that persons with disabilities may view health as a process of self-actualization, role achievement, and/or environmental adaptation. 2 In one study, 2 73% of the 135 persons with disabilities in independent living centers ranked their health as excellent. Multiple barriers have been described within the literature that may be classified as attitudinal and/or environmental. Attitudinal barriers are preconceived perceptions that create stereotypes and negative emotional responses to persons with disabilities, and these responses may affect family relations, work opportunities, and educational attainment. 3 Attitudinal barriers can limit the person's ability to lead a fulfilling life—to achieve the full range of possibilities that life has to offer. These attitudes also influence what services will be provided through legislation and economic programs. 4 Environmental barriers for people with disabilities are physical obstacles to goods, services, and activities that are otherwise accessible to those without disabilities. Environmental barriers prevent access to public and private buildings and prevent people with physical impairments from riding public transit or operating motorized vehicles. 3 Varying degrees of legislation have been implemented in many countries to eliminate environmental barriers; however, many barriers may exist in trying to obtain effective health care in the home and community instead of institutionalized health care. In our issue, Nosek and colleagues' exploration of women with disabilities adds support to the position that health is a multidimensional state, which may be achieved if analyzed from the perspective of the woman with the disability. Jones and Bell provide evidence of the negative health consequences of barriers to health for women with disabilities. Both articles demonstrate how gender and disability interact to create attitudinal and environmental barriers for women. Three of our articles focus on environmental barriers that may be eliminated through changes in attitudinal barriers. Fox and Kim's description of Kansas' experience with the Medicare waiver program provides an analysis of how the provision of community-based care is affected by public policy. Mulvihill and colleagues description of the best practices for out-of-school care helps to define ways communities can better provide the services needed by children with disabilities. Nyamathi and colleagues analysis of how mental health is influenced by veteran status is evidence for how health care access can influence perceived health outcomes. Becker and Stuifbergen's work assess both environmental and attitudinal barriers to health promotion. Interestingly, they describe barriers to health promotion across three different groups, which demonstrate the commonalities in experiences for persons with different medical diagnosis. Harrison and Kahn offer a possibility for understanding how barriers may be created within a culture. This model is from a cultural perspective that no longer relies on medical diagnosis for the designation of disability. This builds upon prior work on disability as a rite of passage, and it could inspire new studies of disability within various cultures. As stated earlier, our goal is to encourage discourse on barriers to health for persons with disabilities in order to inspire new approaches to the study of these barriers and, thus, to their elimination. One topic that remains unexplored in this issue relates to how age interacts with barriers in persons with various disabilities. Intervention studies aimed at the elimination of attitudinal and environmental barriers are also needed. The success of this issue will be seen in the discourse it produces on the topic and to the extent that such discourse eventually leads to social change.",

      "title": "Tethered Love: When Failures in Adult Development Forge Inescapable Archaic Bonds",
      "abstract": "Character development does not end in childhood. It is a lifelong endeavor in which the undertaking of parenthood is a developmental stage. Parenting presents various challenges that promote maturation of the adult, while securing autonomy of the child. These adult developmental tasks include some that enhance abilities: respecting difference, accepting defiance, enduring anger, managing separations, and establishing identification with the child. In addition there are tasks that involve loss: relinquishing fantasies, tolerating disappointment, releasing the archaic bond, surrendering the helm, and withstanding one’s own abandonment. When the adult is incapable of successfully transiting through these parenting challenges, the child’s early ties to the primary caregiver are at risk of being abnormally extended. Parental refusal to relinquish the archaic attachment scuttles their offspring’s journey toward independence, and is referred to as “tethered love.” The concept of tethered love posits a pathogenesis of exaggerated compliance (or defiance) in children that begins with adult developmental failures in their caregivers. Clinical examples are used to underscore the suffocating impact of tethered love and demonstrate how the therapist must put aside feelings of distaste to better understand the child’s continuing connection to a constraining, even crippling, but often intensely loving parent.",

The probability decreases in the following order of relationships: brother/sister, best friend, acquaintance, stranger. Two hypothetical dilemmas were used to study the cultural and age differences in law-abiding orientation of 220 English adolescents and 47 English adults (mean ages in years were 15.50 and 25.83, respectively) in London, and 353 Chinese adolescents and 136 Chinese adults (mean ages in years were 16.81 and 21.24, respectively) in Hong Kong. The general findings supported the above hypotheses. Also (i) there was a positive relation between age and law-abiding orientation and (ii) the Chinese were more oriented to abide by the law than the English.",

      "title": "Factors Contributing to Juvenile Delinquency",
      "abstract": "It has long been a problem why some children steal and not others, why some play truant, or why some set fires and damage property. Theories have been advanced from time to time to explain these things, but only in the last ten or fifteen years have extensive scientific investigation been carried out on these problems. Officers of the juvenile courts, child welfare associations, educational bodies, and mental hygiene clinics have been instrumental in bringing together a vast amount of data concerning juvenile delinquency, from which certain general conclusions may be drawn. Delinquency itself is socially inadequate adjustment on the part of the individual to difficult situations. The factors which go to make up these difficult situations, together with the mental and physical conditions which influence an individual's capacity to adjust, constitute the causes of delinquency. Each juvenile offense is the outcome of a complexity of causes, some of whose origins date back years before the committal of the offense and others whose origins are more obviously and immediately connected with the act of delinquency. It has been shown that a different set of causes is involved in each individual case. It is impossible therefore to state the group of causes which will invariably result in any particular offense. The factors which operate to turn a child's behavior in one direction rather than another may be very obscure, many as yet are beyond the detection of expert sociologists, psychologists, physiologists and others. It often appears that quite different offenses are the results of the same group of causes, but further investigation shows that still",

As noted, people who are vain have an inflated image of themselves that they use to compensate for feelings of inferiority, powerlessness, and self-hatred. Often people who are vain were treated as \"special\" by parents who overprotected and indulged them. As adults, they continue to expect this kind of treatment.

      "title": "Resilience",
      "abstract": "Resilience is the capacity to maintain stable levels of functioning, as well as positive emotions and generative experiences, following or under conditions of significant adversity. Resilience researchers have largely focused on two broad types of adversity: (1) acute and time-limited events that are outside the range of ordinary experience, such as physical or sexual assault, traumatic injury, disease, natural disaster, mass casualty events, war, and interpersonal loss; and (2) chronic enduring stressors, usually experienced in childhood, such as neglect, socioeconomic disadvantage, oppressive political conditions, and physical or mental abuse. Although these two types of adversity necessarily entail different methods and theoretical frameworks, research findings from both literatures have converged on a common conclusion: resilience is common, even under the most extreme adversity. The empirical study of psychological resilience as such is a relatively recent phenomenon—until about thirty-five years ago it drew almost no serious scientific attention. Recently, however, the resilience literature has burgeoned at an exceptional rate. Unfortunately, the study of resilience has been plagued by definitional controversies and methodologically uninformative research. One important cleavage concerns the way resilience is defined and measured. A substantial body of research defines resilience as a personality construct; another literature insists that resilience is defined as an outcome (or process) in response to the experience of significant adversity. Although both approaches have produced relevant and informative research, it is worth noting that, in sheer volume, most resilience research is now devoted to the personality-as-resilience approach. Because these studies often do not study reactions to a marker event, rely exclusively on self-report scales, and employ cross-sectional designs, they are usually (but not always) of inferior methodological quality. Consistent with the suggestions of a number of scholars, this latter approach is described here as “resiliency,” not resilience. Although this bibliography includes high-quality studies that define resilience as a personality construct, most of the research and scholarship listed here operationally defines resilience as an outcome or process that unfolds following acute adversity or during chronic forms of adversity.",

In the present research, controllability of the stigma was systematically varied. Subjects read scenarios in which persons with flaws of speech or appearance were subject to discriminatory behaviors of derogation, exclusion, or unfair treatment. The flaws were either within or beyond the control of the individual possessing them. More prejudice was attributed to those who behaved in a discriminatory way toward persons whose flaws were beyond their control.

According to these dominant\r\npreconceptions, masculinity is seen as being stoic, strong, stubborn\r\nand self-reliant; on the other hand, seeking help is perceived as\r\nshowing weakness\r\n.Experiences of self-stigma and\r\ngender role conflict act as barriers to men’s psychological help seeking; violation of masculine norms and the desire to preserve\r\nmasculinity reduce men’s help-seeking behaviors. Cole et al8 assert\r\nthat gender role conflict plays an incremental role beyond mental\r\nhealth self-stigma in understanding certain types of responses to\r\nmental health needs; that there is a positive relationship between\r\nexperiencing gender role conflict and holding increasingly self-stigmatizing views; and that gender role conflict corresponds with\r\nincreased avoidant behaviors and decreased social support utilization.\r\nAthanasiadas et al describe how depressed men are often involved in\r\nattempts to self-manage their depressive symptoms. This stoic\r\napproach compromises the well-being of depressed men and it\r\ndiscourages them from accessing appropriate support resources.\r\nThe concept of stigma including self-stigma and social stigma is\r\ncited in the literature as one of the barriers preventing men accessing\r\nmental health services, especially for depression. Societal negative\r\nperceptions and lack of knowledge about mental health issues can\r\nresult in an individual experiencing self-stigma. The issues around\r\nstigma especially relating to help-seeking for depression are\r\ndiscussed in several studies\r\n.Wahto et al state that higher\r\nlevels of gender-role conflict, social stigma and self-stigma are\r\nassociated with more negative attitudes toward psychological help\r\nseeking. Ina recent Irish study, O’Donnell et al2 point to men’s sense\r\nof shame in having to ask for help and “failing” to manage their own\r\nproblems. \r\n\r\nHouse et al suggest that improving public knowledge about the\r\nnature of depression; positive messages about the act of help‐seeking,\r\ntypes of treatment available, and effectiveness of treatments; and\r\nwork to overcome the challenges posed by long waiting times and\r\nother service constraints may increase rates of help‐seeking.\r\nStructural barriers seem to be less predictive of help-seeking than\r\nattitudinal barriers\r\n. In particular, lower likelihood of help-seeking\r\nwas associated with men's reluctance to disclose mood-related\r\nsymptoms to their physician/family doctor, a tendency for selfreliance and solving one's own problems, and uncertainly about the\r\nprocess of psychotherapy.\r\nSeidler et al\r\nidentified cost as a main structural barrier among 778\r\nmale survey respondents. Other barriers reported in the literature\r\nincluded lack of knowledge about mental health issues and/or\r\navailable treatment\r\n.\r\nThe literature reviews the importance of customising and tailoring\r\nmental health interventions for men to reflect the important roles\r\nthat masculinity and stigma play in men accessing support\r\n. Bilsker\r\net al6 note that a high proportion of men in Western society have\r\nacquired psychological coping strategies that are often dysfunctional.\r\nThere is a need for men to learn more adaptive coping approaches\r\nlong before they reach a crisis point. Recommendations are made to\r\naddress men’s mental health through: healthcare policy that\r\nfacilitates access; research on tailoring interventions to men;\r\npopulation-level initiatives to improve the capacity of men to cope\r\nwith psychological distress; and clinical practice that is sensitive to the\r\nexpression of mental health problems in men and that responds in a\r\nrelevant manner.\r\nOliffe et al state that the reticence of some men inseeking\r\nprofessional mental health care has drawn public awareness raising\r\nand de-stigmatizing efforts, while clinical guidelines for working with\r\nboys and men have been offered to better serve men seeking help for depression and/or suicidality. There is a strengthening case for male depression comprising specific externalizing symptomology, and\r\nthese findings, along with high male suicide rates (including men who\r\nare seemingly in care), indicate the need for tailored approaches to\r\nmen's depression and suicide prevention. Stiawa et al suggest that in\r\norder to improve mental health among men, gender-specific services\r\nshould be offered.\r\nCramer et al note the key role that general practitioners may play in\r\nhelping men to acknowledge their experiences of depression and\r\nanxiety, listening and providing information on the range of support\r\noptions, including groups.",

      "abstract": "This report was commissioned by the Department of Health (DH) and examines the concept of self-neglect. The relationship between self-neglect and safeguarding in the UK is a difficult one, partly because the current definition of abuse specifies harmful actions by someone other than the individual at risk. Safeguarding Adults Boards’ policies and procedures commonly contain no reference to self-neglect; occasionally they explicitly exclude it or set criteria for its inclusion\r\n\r\nThe perceptions of people who neglect themselves have not been extensively researched, but where they have, emerging themes are pride in self-sufficiency, connectedness to place and possessions and behaviour that attempts to preserve continuity of identity and control. Traumatic histories and life-changing effects are also present in individuals’ own accounts of their situation.\r\n\r\nSelf-neglect is reported mainly as occurring in older people, although it is also associated with mental ill health. Differentiation between inability and unwillingness to care for oneself, and capacity to understand the consequences of one’s actions, are crucial determinants of response. Professional tolerance of self-neglect as lifestyle choice is higher than when it accompanies physical/mental impairment. Professionals express uncertainty about causation and intervention.",

      "title": "A Tribute to Adaptability: Mental Illness and Dementia in Intimate Late-Life Relationships",
      "abstract": "In pondering how to conceptualize the challenges that mental illness and dementia pose to intimate relationships, an overwhelming number of permutations and combinations have occurred to me. These are very complex issues, encompassing marital and nonmarital couple relationships, family relationships, samesex relationships, and multigenerational relationships. Some are extremely stable, long relationships, such as fifty- and sixty-year marriages or partnerships. Others are much briefer, such as a second marriage after the death of a spouse in old age. Some relationships have been what I call stable incompatible relationships of long-standing duration, in contrast to the kind of comfortable and rewarding relationship that we prefer to imagine predominantly occurs in our parents' generation. Furthermore, mental illness and dementia affect relationships in rather different ways. Often, mental illness has persisted throughout adulthood (for example, in the case of schizophrenia, manic depression, major depressive disorders), and the relationship has adapted and accommodated through the years. Or not. Aging will present special challenges to those relationships, and to the intimacy that has existed. In contrast, the dementing illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, may occur where there has been no previous serious psychopathology, so the emergence of the illness may cause a departure from the intimacy that had developed over the life of the relationship. Consequently, this paper is a discussion of variability and individual differences. Ultimately, it is also a tribute to the adaptability of the human spirit. In clinical practice, it is important to feel hopeful about a positive outcome, and over the twenty-plus years that I have been in practice, I have found that there is always a way to conceptualize a problem that allows for hope. In order to focus the discussion, I will limit this paper to dyadic relationships: couples, primarily in the context of caregiving. Several principles should be kept in mind when working with older adults. Variability among people increases with age, so it is best to avoid preconceived notions about individuals and their relationships. We like to say that human beings are most like each other at birth and become progressively more varied with each passing year. Second, regardless of whether a relationship looks desirable from some ideal point of view, some part of it has been working for this couple, and whatever that is should be the starting point for any intervention. Third, people vary tremendously in their ability to face the realities of aging, whether it is their own physical aging, health threats, or other threats to continued independence. Where one couple will retire to a life-care community as a way to accept and plan for their future needs, another will be unable to fully accept the possibility that they may well need significant assistance at some time in the future. WHAT IS INTIMACY? A dictionary definition of intimacy is, marked by very close association, contact or familiarity, of a very personal or private nature (Webster's Dictionary, r975). This definition can characterize a wide variety of relationships, from marital to family and friends and includes therapists. Intimacy has been described as having five aspects: commitment, affective intimacy, cognitive intimacy, physical intimacy, and mutuality (Moss and Schwebel, 1993). An element of closeness and self-disclosure in communication is often associated with healthy intimacy (Moss and Schwebel, 1993). In clinical practice, we see a range of abilities to communicate and, particularly, a wide range of self-disclosure in relationships. Further, cultural values are in play, particularly in the population that is now elderly, and many long-term relationships have navigated through troubled waters despite maintaining fairly superficial levels of communication. It is most useful to accept our client's or subject's perception of the success or failure of intimacy as an expression of the relationship that the person has been able to fashion over time. …",

However, activist thinking was seen to have three strands: personal activism, social activism, and religious activism. Further, fatalistic thinking was not about passive submission but rather the belief that control lay outwith the person in the realm of the social, natural or supernatural worlds.

The terms adolescent pregnancy, teenage pregnancy, and school-aged pregnancy all have been applied to pregnancy at an age and/or developmental stage that is considered premature or inappropriate, especially with respect to outcome. Whereas fertility is determined by biologic factors, the impact of pregnancy and its consequences have biologic, psychosocial, and environmental determinants. The term \"adolescence\" is applied to the period of psychosocial development from childhood to adulthood that corresponds to chronologic ages 10 or 12 to 21 years. Adolescent pregnancy has different implications for the 18- or 19-year-old high school graduate who is married or planning marriage than for the 13-or 14-year-old middle school student who may be beginning the process of adolescence. Although recognizing this broad spectrum, the Committee on Adolescence has chosen the term \"adolescent pregnancy\" for this and related statements. Our primary concern is the individual in early to middle adolescence (younger than the age of 18 years) who is biologically and/or psychosocially immature, and for whom pregnancy is, often unplanned, if not unwanted. Explanations for the high prevalence have ranged from inadequate sex education to sexual promiscuity. In this statement current research data will be reviewed and relevant information will be provided so that pediatricians and others responsible for the health care of adolescents can appreciate the implications and consequences of adolescent sexual activity and early childbearing. SEXUAL ACTIVITY The current problems resulting from teenage pregnancy cannot be appreciated fully without understanding adolescent sexual behavior and the secular changes that have taken place.",

      "title": "The Experience of Shame in Social Phobia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONSocial phobia is highly prevalent anxiety disorder characterized by excessive fear of situations where an individual is subject to scrutiny of others. People with social phobia are concerned that they will react with noticeable and embarrassing signs of strong physiological arousal, such as blushing, shaking, or trembling. As consequence, activities such as eating, drinking, writing or speaking in public, expressing an opinion in group, and talking to member of opposite sex or to an authority figure may actively be avoided to evade perceived negative evaluation of others. As most of our everyday functioning involves contact with other people, social phobia can be an extremely disruptive disorder, which usually causes great distress in sufferer and sometimes for those close to them. Despite social phobia being an extremely disruptive and distressing anxiety disorder impacting many areas of an individual's life its etiology is still poorly understood.Parental Rearing Practices and Social PhobiaHaving known mean age of onset of disorder being in early adolescence contribution of early parental rearing practice in development of disorder seems appropriate to be explored. In fact parental rearing practices have been found to be one of key factors contributing to development of social phobia. Investigating role of parental influence on development of anxiety Rapee and Melville (1997) found significant association between child anxiety and greater parental control and protection and less warmth. Retrospective reports from adults with social phobia have also generally supported similar picture of early parental interaction characterized by greater control and less warmth disorder (Arrindell, Emmelkamp, Monsma and Brilman, 1983; Arrindell et al., 1989; Parker, 1979). Gellar (2000) also reported findings emphasizing relationship between social phobia and overprotective and rejecting parenting styles. Greco and Morris (2002) examining associations among perceived and actual father behavior and child social anxiety, found that fathers of high socially anxious children exhibited more controlling behavior. Taylor and Alden (2005) found that patients who reported childhood overprotection were less adept at taking in or discriminating social cues. A positive correlation between overprotection, rejection and children's anxiety symptoms was reported by Muris, Loxtonb, Neumannc, Kinge and Ollendickf (2006). Similarly, Gastel, Legerstee and Ferdinand (2009) found significant association between maternal and paternal overprotection and child anxiety.Shame and Social PhobiaShame was once considered sleeper in psychopathology (Lewis, 1987) has in recent years come to be seen as the bedrock of psychopathology (Miller, 1996). The word comes from Indo-European word skam meaning to hide and implies fear of exposure (Lewis, 1992). Lewis (1971) defines shame as a self-oriented emotion that involves global, negative self-evaluation associated with feeling of helplessness or sense of passivity in correcting perceived fault. Qian, Liu and Zhu (2001) describes shame as type of negative emotion accompanied by negative introspection and self-evaluation, which shows feature of ''self-orientation'' on phenomenological assessment. Many researchers regard shame as most self-reflecting emotion with subsequent self-evaluation in terms of useless, defectiveness, powerless and exposure in relation to others (Barrett, 1995; Gilbert and Andrews, 1998). Central to phenomenology of shame is presence of ''disapproving public eye'' (Hahn, 2000). Thus, when individuals experience shame, this painful awareness of an (actual or imagined) external critic causes feelings of worthlessness and inferiority, coupled with heightened self-consciousness and an instinctual urge to hide from further exposure resulting in avoidance of social interactions (Tangney, Wagner, and Gramzow, 1992). …",

      "abstract": "Man as an individual, he has always been in a need to belong, to be in a fellowship with other people, both in the beginnings of the history for the sake of survival and later, for his psychological and emotional progress. Prejudice and discrimination are a often occurrence in today's society, mostly based on a variety of stereotypes about certain groups of people or people who behave in a way that deviated from the normative, people who are 'weird and pop' out of society. Behavior towards them changes and becomes hostile, judgmental and often violent. On the one hand, people with mental illness have to deal with everyday symptoms and disabilities that the disease carries, while on the other, they have to deal with the stereotypes and prejudices that are based on delusions. As a result, the opportunity for quality life such as; good job, safe housing, satisfactory health care, as well as social integration with a diverse group of people is taken away from people with mental illness. Also, health professionals are often unaware of the power of their behavior, which can also lead to stigmatisation. According to research, problems that psychiatric patients claim, is that they don't get enough information about their illness or treatment. They feel prognostic negativism, sometimes an unspoken threat, and forced treatment of themselves. Furthermore, they speak to them as if they were children who were excluded from making their own treatment decisions and that they don't have the ability to be in control of their own lives. The conducted surveys conclude that in Zadar County 26% of the population is more accepting psychiatric patients, mostly female, 51% are medium accepting people with mental illness, while only 23% are less likely to accept psychiatric patients, regardless the age of the respondents. These kind of results are creating a new age and a better attitude towards psychiatric patients, but it takes much more effort to actively integrate them into society.",

      "title": "Accountable Managerial Ethics",
      "abstract": "Since ages or centuries, we have enough examples of unethical practices some people/party, where other parties get affected, at least to some extent. Sometimes bribe giver and receiver do the act with ‘mutual agreement/consent’ and they justify the ‘act’. They accept the ‘act’ as harmless or ‘lesser-evil’. Even one party goes to the extent of justifying it as ‘unavoidable’ (lesser-evil). But as we take impartial view of such act, in most of such cases, some other party is directly/indirectly affected or hurt. Getting a deal/contract signed/granted, we hear of some undue ‘favour’ being made/shown. Ministers/officers accepting ‘favours’ (like using chartered flights or air-travel offers) from business houses, for their personal/ family work is a common incident these days. Though it appears to be ‘harmless’ or even ‘lesser evil’ at that very point of time, there is surely expectations of return ‘favour’ for those very ‘harmless’ favours. When we look back to the history of systematic (academic) study or research on this grave issue, affecting our society since many centuries, ‘Business Ethics’ came as an independent subject of formal/serious research only after 1970’s. It now attracts much more attention of researchers, these days. There are many notable findings, which tries establish the ‘necessity’ of practicing ‘ethical practices’ by business-houses, for their very own existence and long run sustainable business. It is beyond the scope of this paper to enlist exhaustively all such notable research. But Reidenbach’ work is one worth discussing now, in this paper.",

Violence has very diverse forms and properties, one of which is sexual harassment. Violence. Sexual violence can occur anywhere, no matter the educational institution, office, public place, or even the safest place such as Islamic boarding schools. Many cases of violence in pesantren are not revealed because of threats received by victims from the perpetrator, victims feel ashamed if they tell the truth, fear of being viewed obliquely by society, bring down the good name of the family, and many other reasons. Some violence prevention actions that Islamic boarding schools can carry out include frequent raids on mobile phones and social media belonging to students or students, conducting various studies on the boundaries that must be maintained between men and women, and so on.

      "title": "Social Comparison by Young Children.",
      "abstract": "Social comparisons are important determinants of behavior in any culture, even cultures which are not so achievement-oriented as ours. Comparison with others is often the sole source of judgments about the adequacy or the acceptability of behavior. Frequently, standards by which to judge one's own behavior do not exist other than those provided by the actions of others. For the growing child, the problem of standardizing one's behavior is particularly difficult because standards of appropriateness change with age. At age three, the child may receive comfort and solace when he cries after arguing or fighting with a friend but, by age five, his parents may point to his older brother and exhort the child to be a little man like his brother and not cry over small disagreements; still later, the child may incur his parents' disapproval when he reports a fight with a peer and, at this point, his attention may be directed quite specifically to a brother, a sister or a peer whose social life is less besmirched by altercations. Psychologists and other students of behavior often invoke social comparison opportunities in research. For example, in studies of the effects of success and failure upon children's behavior (e.g., Mischel, Coates & Raskoff, 1968) , children's actual performance may be held constant and only the norms concerning the performance of others varied. The subjects may receive a preset series of scores but are told that good scores, scores received by most children of the subject's age, are either: a) much lower than (success) , or b) much higher than (failure) the scores the subjects actually receive. Such procedures are quite effective. The fact that success and failure are defined purely in terms of social comparison judgments, which the subjects presumably make, is seldom mentioned.",

      "title": "Aggression and violence.",
      "abstract": "It is fallacious to believe that agression and violence are features peculiar to the 1980s or even to the 20th century.Aggressive behaviour is a characteristic human trait and is sometimes even encouraged.However, it may progress to violence, although this is usually discouraged, since another trait of human beings is control.This may be from without or within, but most human interaction allows for some aggression, assumes it will be controlled, and breaks down when violence ensues.By its very nature an accident and emergency department is exposed to both aggression and violence.The staff of these departments witness the effects and treat the victims of physical violence in its most obvious form.In addition, however, the patients themselves may be aggressive, as may their relatives.The staff assume that most of this aggression will be controlled but often it isn't.Aggressive verbal outbursts are serious for they may often herald physical abuse.After a physical attack has been made the matter is usually one for the police.However, there are steps which can be taken to prevent this final outburst.People feel most threatened when they are frightened and seem unable to influence events.This frustration may be expressed as violence to others or to themselves.When directed inwards it may end in attempted suicide.It is known that when control is already impaired, for example by alcohol or mental illness, such attempts are more common (Kessel, 1965).Similarly, when unemployment is prolonged, and therefore influence is impaired, attempts at suicide are again increased (Platt & Kreitman, 1984).Mental illness and subsequent loss of control and influence tend not surprisingly to increase acts of aggression directed both inwardly and outwardly to others (Yesavage, 1983).An accident and emergency department may prevent some of the violence directed towards it by removing the frustration and lack of influence often felt by patients and relatives.Some departments have installed videos which both entertain and educate those waiting for treatment.The current waiting time should be displayed and people given regular updates on the reason for any serious delays.Specific and remedial causes of patients' fear and lack of control must be sought.The more obvious causes are diabetic hypoglycaemia, head injury, mental illness and epilepsy.Drugs such as alcohol are commonly used and often predispose to accidents (Wechsler et al., 1969).Alcohol is often abused by the pathologically aggressive (Nylander, 1979) and in otherwise normal people it impairs control and behaviour.Perhaps as important as its direct toxic effects on the central nervous system may be the neurological effects of its associated hypoglycaemia.This may occur after prolonged drinking and little intake of food (Freingel et al., 1963), or within a few hours when alcohol is taken with sugar (O'Keefe & Marks, 1977).The latter stimulates insulin which lowers the blood glucose.The former then potentiates the insulin and prevents release of glucose from the liver.Symptomatic hypoglycaemia can ensue and the subsequent aggression is well recognized.Not so well recognized is that taking alcohol with glucose is common, e.g.gin and tonic, rum and coke.If alcohol is consumed with starch, as in beer, this effect is not seen (Jaffe et al., 1982).",

      "title": "A Hard Look at Stimulating and Predicting Development: The Cases of Bonding and Screening",
      "abstract": "An axiom of medicine is to diagnose and treat a disease in its formative stages before it becomes so advanced that treatment is difficult or impossible. The same theme runs through aspects of neonatology and developmental pediatrics—organ systems and processes are laid down early in development and supportive or deleterious factors operating during these early stages can permanently influence or alter the course of development. Belief in \"formative Stages was applied to behavior by Sigmund Freud who emphasized the crucial contribution of early experiences to adult personality. A half century later, the same general principle was used to justify Head Start, an educational program that was supposed to equalize the social classes by providing an intellectual boost to disadvantaged children during their formative years. The principle of \"formative years\" pervaded theory and practice in developmental psychology for decades, but there were always dissonant findings. For example, five decades of research shows quite clearly that test scores obtained within the first year or two of life do not predict later intelligence for normal children.1 Weight and especially skinfold thickness assessed during infancy do not predict later weight or obesity, and early social disadvantage and stress do not necessarily lead to later psychosocial dysfunction. Indeed, today the emphasis in some quarters of developmental psychology is on change, modifiability, and unpredictability in development rather than on consistency.2",

      "title": "LIFE STYLE AND HEALTH EDUCATION",
      "abstract": "Lifestyle is the interest, behavior, opinion, style of living or world outlook of an individual, group, or culture; a combination of tangible factors like demographics and intangible factors like personal values and preferences.1 Recently researchers have more interest in the relationship between life style and health. Millions of people, following unhealthy lifestyle (or risk-factors), are plagued with morbidity, disability and mortality due to non-communicable, communicable diseases &amp; nutritional disorders. Persons having unhealthy behaviors may be called as ‘at risk groups’.2 Although a healthy lifestyle has consistently been shown to decrease mortality, the population prevalence of healthy living remains low.3 The mental health of an individual can be assessed by his behavior and attitude. Common lifestyle variables influencing health include diet, exercise, sleep, smoking, alcohol consumption, substance abuse, stress management, sexual behavior, internet, recreation, etc.4 Besides, weight management, exposure to the sun, social contact, work life balance, leisure activities, screening for cancer etc. make a healthy life style. Healthy ways of living are developed through processes of socialization with parents, friends, relatives and community. However, not all life style factors are harmful. There are many life styles that promote health. For example, adequate nutrition, exercise, meditation, enough sleep etc.5 Modern or slow epidemics of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) e.g. hypertension (HTN), coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, cancer etc. have been increasing in incidence compared to the previous century. With the increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of NCDs is on the rise. About 2 billion people are overweight in developed as well as low to middle income countries.6 Comorbidities of obesity include HTN, CHD, DM, stroke, cancers, gallbladder disease, dyslipidaemia, osteoarthritis, gout and sleep apnoea.7 Obesity is not only preventable but treatable with lifestyle modifications to forestall DM.8 Furthermore, several pathways linking obesity and CHD have been described; in particular coronary atherosclerosis, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.9 In a study by CDC conducted in late 1970s in US, approximately 48% of all premature deaths prior to age 75 years could be traced to one’s lifestyle or health behavior choices, hence focusing on a personal responsibility model whereas another study accounts for about 63% of all deaths.10 Human behavior is a major obstacle to disease control. Changes in human behavior may prevent most of the world's major health problems &amp; premature deaths at low cost. Public health is defined as ‘the health status of a defined group of people and the governmental actions and conditions at the local, state, and national levels to promote healthy behaviors, prevent spread of disease and injuries, protect against environmental hazards &amp; disasters and assure the curative and rehabilitative health services. Many public health recommendations and clinical guidelines emphasize that healthy lifestyles have substantial health benefits.11 Changes in the life-style of the population by health education encompass three approaches of primary prevention as recommended by the WHO for prevention of chronic diseases. In first approach or primordial prevention, children are discouraged from adopting harmful lifestyles through individual/ mass education in countries in which many adult health problems (e.g., obesity, hypertension) have not yet appeared. Lifestyles are formed during childhood and aim is to prevent the emergence of risk factors. Second approach or population (mass) strategy is directed at the whole population, irrespective of individual risk level. A small reduction in the average blood pressure/ serum cholesterol in the community, helps in reducing the CHD prevalence. Third approach or high-risk strategy, on the other hand, aims to detect individuals at high risk by the optimum use of clinical methods and provide preventive care to them. To have an impact on the population, all the above three approaches should be implemented as they are usually complementary but the results are perceived after several decades and not immediately. Besides health education the population must have access to preventive measures.5 Lifestyle medicine program serves as a systematized approach to manage NCDS by addressing multiple risk factors through self-management skills.12 Physical activity leading to cardiorespiratory fitness is needed in all age groups, both sexes, race &amp; ethnicities to prevent NCDs including CVDs.13 Better control of behavioral risk factors alone could prevent one-third of all acute and two-thirds of chronic disabilities.

      "title": "Ethical issues in genetic research",
      "abstract": "Genetic research raises ethical issues that differ in many ways from those that arise in other kinds of human subject research. Aside from the generally low likelihood of injury from drawing blood, the harms that might result to subjects once the genetic data is obtained range from minor to major, from physiological to psychosocial and even economic. Disclosure of results may cause loss or increased cost of health and/or life insurance, discrimination and stigmatization. In this presentation, I am going to discuss the issue through the followings: Privacy and confidentiality Unlike other kinds of health data, genetic information applies to or is about more than one person. (parents, siblings, children, and perhaps others). Research that includes follow-up studies requires that a subjects unique information be linked to the genetic information. For this and other reasons, many investigators seek to unlink personal identifiers from genetic data or biological specimens. Successful unlinking reduces or eliminates some threats to privacy and confidentiality. Informed consent The participant should be adequately informed. Consent should be free from coercion or undue influence. The participant should be fully competent. Risks of harm The idea of testing can cause pre- and post-test anxiety. Disclosure of results may result in employment and social bias, discrimination and stigmatization. Family members of the index subject may face similar risks of harm. The presentation also tackles the subject of research on stored biological samples and the ethical issues, with discussion of the laws and regulations applicable.",

      "abstract": "The causality behind psychiatric disorders lies on a still poorly understood interaction between genetic, biological, environmental, social, and psychodynamic factors. The classical biopsychosocial model hypothesizes that psychopathy develops when genetic and neurobiological components are associated with personality traits such as impulsivity, increasing the risk when these individuals are exposed to a dysfunctional family, and worsening when the surrounding social environment fails to provide basic protection. Notwithstanding, other models have been studied. For instance, brain structure and function, neurotransmitters, and hormones are traditionally categorized as biological risk factors; however, they may have either a genetic or an environmental origin, or they may reflect an interaction between both, characterizing the so-called biosocial interaction. Acting on gene expression, environmental factors may modify the brain, changing psychopathic traits and increasing the risk of developing the disorder or, on the contrary (i.e., in a positive way), protecting the individual. Regarding environmental influences, family dysfunction is the most important psychological factor involved, covering paternal antisocial behavior or alcoholism, lack of boundaries and supervision as a child, and parental separation or loss. Childhood trauma may have a dramatic impact on the child’s mental health and is also related to psychopathy. Finally, ethical issues are discussed: Does the presence of psychopathy affectcriminal responsibility in these individuals? If yes, in what way? Should psychopaths committi ng crimes be sent to prison or to forensic hospitals? Is it correct to subject psychopaths to research and scienti fi c investi gati on? These and other questi ons are addressed in the light of current knowledge and controversies.",

Successful ageing is the attempt to achieve a state of inner satisfaction and happiness in spite of the negative effects associated with old age: loss, external and internal destabilization, etc. Successful development in old age has many forms. It can generally be defined as an attempt to achieve the greatest profit with the smallest loss. The problem is establishing the universal criteria of successful ageing. It is possible to restrict the study to the observation of individual factors which are either objective or subjective, long-term or short-term, specific or universal or static versus dynamic. The problem is creating a theory that will explain all the processes and consequences of old age—none of the theories has so far succeeded in doing this. Life satisfaction as a subjective criterion of successful ageing has been most emphasized in two contradictory theories: activity theory and disengagement theory. Other theories are: growth theories, cognitive theories, dynamic theories, SOC model, cultural anthropological theories, the interaction model of longevity, etc.",

It is a period that teenager may involve himself in risk situations for his health as the use of alcoholic drinks, smoking, drugs, sex without protection and car accidents, and others. There exist myths and stereotips around sexuality of people with disabilities. For example, the popular belief establishes that a person with disability loses his sexuality and with it, every possibility of conceiving an individual and familiar life project. On the contrary, sexuality is a dimension of personality that is always present in human behavior and it exists the belief that have a physical health is important for a healthy sexual life and a disability leads to believe that a person with disability as an asexual person. In this sense, it is important to propose the necessity of considering that the presence of a physical impediment in a teenager does not mean to be sexually handicapped because sexuality is not just a biological function but also it is the deepest source of meeting, intimacy and communication of feelings and affection. Therefore, to deprive a human being of something inalienable to his nature results a crime and an attempt to the human rights.",

A stigma is anything that discredits an individual and leads to one being assigned a \"spoiled identity.\" With reference to lesbian, gay and bisexual youth, the stigma is considered a blemish on one's character that often leads to stereotyping and stigmatisation. This homophobia puts many lesbian, gay and bisexual youth at risk for suicide, chemical abuse, dropping out of school, verbal and physical abuse, homelessness, prostitution, HIV infection, and psychosocial developmental delays. Approaches and strategies for working with lesbian, gay and bisexual youth are suggested and trends and issues about homosexuality in the United States, with a potential impact on lesbian, gay and bisexual youth, are discussed.",

      "title": "SOCIAL VALUE-SOCIAL BEHAVIOR INCONSISTENCY AND EARLY SIGNS OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY IN ADOLESCENCE",
      "abstract": "It is generally recognized that the development of social behavior is in large measure mediated by the identification process through which the child adopts the values of both parents to some extent but the same-sexed parent in particular. Although Freud's (5) formulation of identification involves an incorporation of the same-sexed parent as a way of reducing the retaliatory fears associated with competition in the Oedipal or Electra situation (identification with the aggressor), others (2, I1, 13) have relied on learning principles to account for the gradual transition from asocial infancy to the highly socialized behavior of the young adult. Although American childrearing practices vary in specific detail, the inculcation of parental social values in the offspring often progresses by associating behaviors which violate such values with anxiety through punishment or threat of punishment. Thus, behaving in socially desirable ways not only elicits positive rewards from parents and other adults but also allows the child to avoid the anxiety cued by socially undesirable behavioral alternatives. The later adolescent years (18 to 2o) appear to be a period during which the maturing child might experience particular difficulties in maintaining a consistency between his own behavior and what he has learned to perceive as socially desirable behavior. For one reason, his adult strivings for greater independence may lead the adolescent into conflict with parental or other authority figures and his social behaviors may reflect intentional violations of parental social sanctions. Another reason why the later adolescence period may reflect inconsistency between social values and social behaviors is that the adolescent may find that he does not as yet have the social skills appropriate to behaving in a socially desirable adult manner. A third possibility would be that a change in the adolescent's social values occurs through nonparental influences but he is unable to change the well-established social behavior patterns which had been consistent with the prior set of values. No matter what the source of social value social behavior inconsistency, one would expect on an a priori basis that a heightened level of anxiety would be a common product because of the previous history of punishment associ-",

Specifically, research shows qualitative progress during preadolescence (ages 10–12 years) to more advanced forms and levels of logical reasoning, hypothetical reasoning, metalogical understanding, epistemic cognition, scientific reasoning, argumentation, perspective taking, and moral rationality. Development often continues across adolescence and much of adulthood, but development beyond ages 12 or 13 years is much less predictable, universal, and age-related than development over the first 12 years. Claims of adolescent irrationality are stereotypes that greatly overstate the difference between adolescents and adults. Claims about the immaturity of adolescent brains fail to acknowledge the historical and cultural construction of adolescence as we know it. I conclude that adolescents are best seen as young adults.

      "title": "The specific form of violence for constituting each relational model",
      "abstract": "People violently constitute relationships though circumcision and excision, brutal initiations, killing rivals to the throne, proving loyalty to a superior by killing someone who threatens him, and human sacrifice. People enhance their own relationships with their deities by extreme asceticism, flagellation, or amputating a digit as an offering; others facilitate a vision of their personal companion spirit by hanging themselves by hooks through their chest muscles. The conduct or performance of many relationships consists of organized, socially instituted violence such as boxing and mixed martial arts, ice-hockey checking and football tackling, or combat among warriors who fight for glory. Redressive and terminative violence in response to transgressions of social relationships includes all sorts of corporal and capital punishment: burning witches, killing adulterers, eye-for-an-eye vengeance and feuding, killing men who insult one’s honor, and honor suicide by those who have failed to do their duty. Redressive violence is ubiquitous, ranging from dueling to resolve a dishonor, judicial combat to determine guilt, lynching those perceived as disrespectful, beating wives perceived as having failed to be sufficiently dutiful, attacking husbands who are disrespectful jerks, terrorist bombing, and targeted killing by drones. Sometimes violence is intended to enforce a relationship by forestalling transgression – for example, by terrorizing subjects or slaves into submission. Torturing heretics and enemies falls somewhere in between redress and enforcement, as do violent self-defense and killing intruders. In honor cultures, killing a dishonored sister, daughter, or cousin terminates an intolerable relationship, cleansing the stain and thereby restoring the family honor. Innumerable cultures conduct, or used to conduct, trial by ordeal – for example, adjudicating witchcraft guilt by submerging the accused to see if she drowns, making her hold a hot iron to see if it burns her, or giving her poison to see if she dies. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was morally motivated violence on a mass scale, motivated by MP proportionality cost and benefit computations aimed to reduce American casualties in the most efficient way. The most massive moral violence practices in history were twentieth-century ethnic cleansings, acts of “purifying the race” or the nation, where the removal or killing of persons construed to “pollute” the shared essence of a “people” was motivated by the feeling that “mixture” or “mongrelization” is evil, unnatural, disgusting, dishonorable, and dangerous.",

      "abstract": "Loneliness is a distressing feeling that accompanies the perception that one's social needs are not being met by the quantity or the quality of one's social relationships. It is a subjective experience of a perceived discrepancy between the preferred and actual level and quality of social interaction.1 In contrast, social isolation is an objective lack of meaningful and sustained social contacts, interactions, networks or belonging. Social isolation describes a paucity of social relationships, while loneliness depicts the lived experience and recognition of that absence.2 Although sometimes used interchangeably, loneliness and social isolation are unique conditions that share overlapping features, risk factors, and consequences. One may feel lonely with or without being socially isolated, just as one may or may not feel lonely despite being alone. These conditions do often coexist, as demonstrated in a study of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, both loneliness and social isolation were present in one-third of individuals; one-third of those who were lonely were also socially isolated, and 94% of those who were socially isolated were also lonely (Figure 1).3 Loneliness is neither a disease nor classified as a mental health disorder. Some have suggested that loneliness is a new geriatric syndrome: a health condition highly prevalent in older adults that is multifactorial in cause and contributes to adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic unmasked and magnified the detrimental effects of social isolation and loneliness in older populations. We are learning more about the physical and psychological impacts of loneliness and ways to mitigate social isolation.",

Unlike other exceptionalities, the prognosis for giftedness is, of course, considerably more positive. Like the others, however, this kind of differentness makes demands on family and community resources and carries risks of psychosocial stress, social isolation, and nonfulfillment of potential. Given society9s other pressing needs, those of this group often are brushed aside, even resented; both the life quality of the children and their families and the contribution the children might make in years to come, therefore, can be eroded. All children deserve to love school and to have the opportunity to make the best of their possibilities. Informed and sympathetic pediatricians who are sensitive to the issues involved can play critical roles in promoting healthy development. Definitions and Prevalence Reasoning from the apparent symmetry of the normal curve, professionals sometimes tend to regard giftedness as the mirror image of mental retardation, but this is not a useful model. There is much greater diversity among the highly capable than among the less capable. Indeed, advanced ability is neither restrictive nor defining; gifted children (and their families) are probably more diverse than any other group in our society.",

      "title": "Looked after and adopted children: applying the latest science to complex biopsychosocial formulations",
      "abstract": "Looked after and adopted children are among the most vulnerable in our society and it is well established that they present with a higher prevalence of mental health problems than children who live with their birth family. In their histories, they frequently have birth parents who have lived chaotic lives, some with mental health problems and substance misuse, and have experienced disruptions of care as well as exposure to neglect and/or abuse. However, often when they try to access mental health services, all their problems are formulated as ‘trauma and attachment issues’ with lack of data to support these. This article presents a case study of a 15-year-old boy whose severe difficulties were understood and formulated in terms of ‘attachment problems’ for many years. Neuro-developmental issues, unrelated to his being removed from his birth parents and adopted, had not been considered as the biological factors of the formulation (e.g. genetics and intra-uterus events) were ignored. Because there are no evidence-based interventions for a vaguely defined presentation such as ‘attachment problems’, he was given non-evidenced therapies for years and the parents felt blamed. Understandably, there was then little progress with his difficulties and this in turn had a very detrimental impact on his family, academic and social life. It is recommended that looked after and adopted children have their presentations formulated using a biopsychosocial model that takes into account their complexities to personalise future interventions, just like children who live with their birth parents. It is imperative they stop receiving mental health services where ‘one size fits all’ and that the training of staff working with this group ensures that children’s whole life experiences are understood.",

Males are more likely to exhibit risky behaviour than females. Although minor or infrequent antisocial acts may be frequent in adolescence, not all adolescents get involved, and many do not get involved a lot. The most powerful predictors from middle childhood to chronic delinquency in adolescence are: troublesomeness in school; hyperactivity/poor concentration; low intelligence and poor attainment; family criminality; family poverty; and poor parenting. Social control theory argues that antisocial behaviour is less likely when the young person has a stake in social institutions such as the family, school, or clubs and societies.",

      "abstract": "Sexual violence occurs in every part of the globe, and it is an ancient problem with modern relevance. For centuries to millennia, sexual violence has been used as a means to subjugate, control, or demean women and other vulnerable populations. Sexual violence can have substantial physical and mental health effects on survivors. Health consequences of sexual violence vary from mild to severe medical, gynecological, obstetric, surgical, psychological, and psychiatric trauma. The most common sequelae of sexual violence are mental health consequences, and the effects of violence manifest in different ways throughout the life span. Adults commonly experience depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic disorders. Mental health sequelae of violence manifest somewhat differently in children, though they are also susceptible to mood, anxiety, and posttraumatic disorders. Young children who have survived sexual violence commonly display abnormal behaviors such as eating disturbances, developmental regression, language delays, or attachment disorders. Over time, sexual violence in conflict zones has received the needed attention it deserves.",

      "abstract": "Older people who die alone are commonly portrayed negatively in the academic and popular literature. Dying alone is viewed either as an outcome of anti-social behaviour or the result of family, neighbourhood or social services neglect. The idea that people may be exercising agency, resistance or dissent at the end of life and that they do not want attention from services or the wider community receives little or no consideration. By comparing the community and professional views with those of the elderly about end of life preferences, this paper argues that the academic and community image of the elderly as ’’victims’’ has eclipsed the usual ability to see this group in pluralist terms. This stereotype of older people who die alone has negative consequences for sociological and policy analysis.",

      "title": "Violência sexual : impactos sobre o desenvolvimento da autoconsciência e autorrepresentações do self no ciclo de vida",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence against children and adolescents, a modality of sexual violence, is characterized as any sexual act or game, established in heterosexual or homosexual relationships, involving one or more adults and a child or adolescent, aiming at sexually stimulating the victim, or using it to obtain sexual stimulation in erotic, pornographic and sexual practices imposed through enticement, physical force or threats. Considered a public health problem and violation of human rights, this phenomenon produces serious biopsychosocial consequences, including feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, impairment of physical and emotional development, making victims more vulnerable to suicide ideas and attempts, as well as psychosomatic illnesses and sexually transmitted. Although scientific studies have pointed out the consequences of sexual violence in childhood and adolescence on the physical and emotional dimensions of victims, little is known about its influence on the development of self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. Based on these assumptions, this study investigates the impacts of sexual violence on self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. It is characterized as a cross-sectional and comparative study, involving two groups of participating subjects, divided between victims and non-victims of sexual violence in childhood and/or adolescence. Its sample is composed of 236 subjects, between youth and adults, of both sexes, university students and from different economic classes. The investigation consists of three interlaced studies, the first of which is an ex-post-facto type, in which the participants answered the handout containing a sociodemographic questionnaire and psychometric instruments; and, the second and third, multiple case studies, of the phenomenal and qualitative type, based on semi-structured interviews, using a thematic script. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, Pearson, Spearman and Pearson Bisserial correlation tests, Student's t test, Multiple Regression Techniques, and Similarity Structure Analysis. The qualitative data followed the interpretative model of the double hermeneutics, proposed by Giddens (1984), by which it is possible to unveil the meanings that the subjects themselves constraint from their actions, compared with the sense that the analysts, from theoretical and methodological constructs build in relation to the actions and interpretations of their interlocutors (Geertz, 1987).. Thus, we sought broader understandings about the impacts of sexual violence on the structuring of self-awareness and self-representations of the self; as well as about the aggravating factors for the occurrence of the phenomenon in childhood and adolescence; and, on the meanings attributed to them by those who have violated their bodies and intimacy, which is fundamental to the most accurate understanding of sexual violence in the life cycle.",

      "abstract": "Among factors identified as being statistically associated with child abuse, we can broadly distinguish those related to characteristics of the child itself and those related to family characteristics, bearing in mind that parents are the perpetrators of child abuse in the vast majority of cases. Observed among children are: young age (abuse begins very early in life); male sex, as concerns shaken baby syndrome and lethal violence; the presence of mental disability and/or behavioural disorders; and particularly frequently, prematurity, especially if it requires neonatal hospitalisation. In fact, any circumstance that makes early attachment between the newborn and its parents difficult or impossible, such as prematurity or postpartum depression, constitutes a situation of risk for subsequent child abuse. Among parents, psycho-affective factors take precedence over socio-economic factors, which play no role. Child abuse is found in all social classes, as is the transgenerational transmission of violence, with those parents having suffered from abuse as children being more at risk than others of becoming abusive themselves.",

      "title": "Reproductive rights of mentally retarded persons.",
      "abstract": "Mental retardation denotes sub-average intellectual functioning, based on IQ, i.e. the inability of normal learning, accompanied by behavioral and developmental disorders. Persons with impairments (cognitive, motor, sensory or psychiatric) have often been, both through human history and today victims of discrimination and deprived of their basic human rights, both in the public and the private life spheres. Since the end of the 20th century, throughout the developed world, many disabled persons can accomplish their dreams and rights. However, the issue of sexuality is still an obstacle in realizing oneself as a whole person, of course in accordance with personal psychophysical abilities. The greatest problem is present in persons with severe disablement, considered not apt enough for information on sexuality and for expressing themselves as persons with their own sexual needs. Thus it is desirable to observe each disabled person individually and flexibly enough in order to establish parameters for the functioning of an intimate affair on the level of understanding and assent. The legal system must protect the most vulnerable and ensure for them the right of choice and consent, as well as the possibility of fulfilling their sexual needs, so that they could love and be loved. Naturally, the system must be built on foundations that satisfy the needs of its users, but also of persons engaged in work with them. Sex education should contain information regarding biological, socio-cultural and spiritual dimensions of sexuality, including cognitive, affective and behavioral domains. Unfortunately, very few educational programs with such aims provide sex education, not only for the disabled young population but also for the healthy. This review article is based on international investigations and Croatian legislative postulates. Its aim is to focus the attention of both professionals and non-professionals on this delicate problem.",

      "title": "Social Dysfunction in Psychosis Is More Than a Matter of Misperception: Advances From the Study of Metacognition",
      "abstract": "Many with psychosis experience substantial difficulties forming and maintaining social bonds leading to persistent social alienation and a lack of a sense of membership in a larger community. While it is clear that social impairments in psychosis cannot be fully explained by symptoms or other traditional features of psychosis, the antecedents of disturbances in social function remain poorly understood. One recent model has proposed that deficits in social cognition may be a root cause of social dysfunction. In this model social relationships become untenable among persons diagnosed with psychosis when deficits in social cognition result in inaccurate ideas of what others feel, think or desire. While there is evidence to support the influence of social cognition upon social function, there are substantial limitations to this point of view. Many with psychosis have social impairments but not significant deficits in social cognition. First person and clinical accounts of the phenomenology of psychosis also do not suggest that persons with psychosis commonly experience making mistakes when trying to understand others. They report instead that intersubjectivity, or the formation of an intimate shared understanding of thoughts and emotions with others, has become extraordinarily difficult. In this paper we explore how research in metacognition in psychosis can transcend these limitations and address some of the ways in which intersubjectivity and more broadly social function is compromised in psychosis. Specifically, research will be reviewed on the relationship between social cognitive abilities and social function in psychosis, including measurement strategies and limits to its explanatory power, in particular with regard to challenges to intersubjectivity. Next, we present research on the integrated model of metacognition in psychosis and its relation to social function. We then discuss how this model might go beyond social cognitive models of social dysfunction in psychosis by describing how compromises in intersubjectivity occur as metacognitive deficits leave persons without an integrated sense of others' purposes, relative positions in the world, possibilities and personal complexities. We suggest that while social cognitive deficits may leave persons with inaccurate ideas about others, metacognitive deficits leave persons ill equipped to make broader sense of the situations in which people interact and this is what leaves them without a holistic sense of the other and what makes it difficult to know others, share experiences, and sustain relationships. The potential of developing clinical interventions focused on metacognition for promoting social recovery will finally be explored.",

      "title": "Critical Analysis of Athlete Retirement from Sport",
      "abstract": "Object of the analysis. Investigation problem. Athletes' retirement from sports activities and their life after the end of their sports career is relevant in scientific, practical and social terms. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of scientific studies on athletes’ retirement from sport and how it relates to their life after their carrier in sports.Research methods. The analysis of scientific literature revealed that the main reasons for athletes to finish their careers in sports were trauma, health-related problems or age. Retirement can also be associated with family or family planning. Sports career termination is discussed in two ways, when one retires from sport voluntarily and when one is forced to do so. Voluntary retirement for athletes is usually a planned event and thus most often it does not have a negative impact on their future life. These athletes tend to choose a family over their sports carriers, continue their education or go to work in sports related sectors. Another important factor is athletic identity. Athletes with strong athletic identity during their sports careers tend to have better social life after their retirement. These athletes also tend to have a strong athletic identity after their careers, thus they are less likely to experience stress or depressive symptoms due to their sports career termination. Forced retirement from sports career is usually due to career-ending injuries. Such career outcome is associated with greater short-term and long-term problems in the post-sport transition period. Since athletic careers are strongly controlled by others, the unforeseen outcomes of an unexpected sports career termination results in negative consequences that are related to increased personal responsibility for their further actions. This becomes a greater problem for those athletes that have a higher level of athletic identity as it results in anxiety and depression. Therefore, forced retirement from a sports career is considered to be the most troublesome and worrying problem in the field.Outcomes and conclusions An examination of research literature focused on athlete’s retirement suggests that termination of a sports career is an important event the consequences of which depend on whether it ends by own choice or not. Since the planned retirement from the sports career is less challenging, it is important to help athletes prepare for this stage of their lives. Additionally, it is crucial to focus all efforts on creating a support system for athletes who were forced to end their athletic careers.Keywords: athletic carrier, retirement, life after sport.",

      "abstract": "Homicide-suicide is defi ned by a homicide committed by someone who subsequently commits suicide. Dyadic term has been also used for these deaths as these incidents often involve a pair of persons. Homicidesuicides usually involve a male perpetrator, who commits one or more homicides and then commits suicide. They generally occur within a family and may involve children. There is a love or spousal relationship between the victim and perpetrator in most cases. Three types of homicide-suicides have been classifi ed; familial, spousal/consortial, and extrafamilial types. They have different sub-classifi cations defi ned by age of individuals and relationship. Homicide-suicides in older couples were interpreted as dyadic deaths, dual suicide pacts, or homicide-suicides with altruistic motives which are attributed to the perpetrator. We present a homicide-suicide of an older couple involving a complex suicide. A 77-year-old retired man, who lived with his 72-year-old wife, was described as hot tempered by his relatives. On the incident day, his wife reported to her neighbors that he was acting strangely, and she was worried. Later that evening, he killed his wife by hitting her on the head with an iron bar. He then killed himself by cutting his abdominal region and by hanging himself. A detailed death scene investigation and autopsies of the couple were performed. The case presented is unique because it involves both homicide-suicide and complex suicide which is defi ned as using more than one method to induce death. In addition, a homicide-suicide case involving complex suicide has not been reported in the literature before.",

      "abstract": "People who identify as sexual and/or gender minorities (SGM) face unique risk factors on individual, family, community, and societal levels, often beginning in early childhood. Though making up approximately 3–5% of the population, the SGM population is overrepresented among the homeless, the poor, the incarcerated, and in mental health facilities. We also know that SGM individuals are at higher risk of abuse, family alienation, trafficking, mood disorders, drug and alcohol dependence, home insecurity, suicide, and school dropouts. All these risks can be attributed, or are exacerbated by minority stress, derived from systemic and pervasive bias and oppression. Anti-SGM prejudice at all levels creates obstacles to high-quality and affirming medical and mental health care, despite the increased needs. These risks are informed and affected by many factors, including developmental stage, temperament, attachment quality, trauma history, culture, religion, laws, and health/ability status. Despite or perhaps because of the many challenges, SGM individuals also demonstrate stress-related growth, resulting in gains in several socio-emotional and psychological arenas. This chapter will grapple with the risks, and explore affirming, trauma-informed, and resilience-building approaches to care at all levels.",

      "title": "Personality and Health",
      "abstract": "Although the belief that personality is linked to health goes back at least to Greek and Roman times, the scientific study of these links began in earnest only during the last century. The field of psychosomatic medicine, which grew out of psychoanalysis, accepted that the body and the mind were closely connected. By the end of the 20th century, the widespread adoption of the five-factor model of personality and the availability of reliable and valid measures of personality traits transformed the study of personality and health. Of the five broad domains of personality (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and intellect/openness), the most consistent findings in relation to health have been obtained for conscientiousness (i.e., hard-working, reliable, self-controlled). People who are more conscientious have better health and live longer lives than those who are less conscientious. These advantages are partly explained by the better health behaviors, good social relationships, and less stress that tend to characterize those who are more conscientious. The causal relation between personality and health may run in both directions; that is, personality influences health, and health influences personality. In addition to disease diagnoses and longevity, changes on biomarkers such as inflammation, cortisol activity, and cellular aging are increasingly used to chart health in relation to personality traits and to test explanatory models. Recognizing that both personality and health change over the life course has promoted longitudinal studies and a life-span approach to the study of personality and health.",

What happens?Sexual abuse entails all types of sexual activity often with escalating intrusiveness.Children may be exposed to indecent acts, pornographic photography, or external genital contact in the form of being fondled, masturbating an adult, or being used for intercrural intercourse.Finally, they may be penetrated orally, vaginally, or anally.How often does sexual abuse occur?Nobody knows how often sexual abuse occurs.It is certain that a lot of abuse is undiagnosed and equally certain that false diagnoses may be catastrophic.Five main risk factors predispose to child sexual abuse.* Previous incest or sexual deviance in the family * New male member of the household with a record of sexual offences * Loss of inhibition due to alcohol * Loss of maternal libido or sexual rejection of father * A paedophilic sexual orientation, especially in relation to sex rings and pornography.

No disability, however slight, nor however severe, implies lesser moral, political or ethical status, worth or value. This is a version of the principle of equality. The three fallacies exhibited by some or all of my critics are the following: (1) Choosing to repair damage or dysfunction or to enhance function, implies either that the previous state is intolerable or that the person in that state is of lesser value or indicates that the individual in that state has a life that is not worthwhile or not thoroughly worth living. None of these implications hold. (2) Exercising choice in reproduction with the aim of producing children who will be either less damaged or diseased, or more healthy, or who will have enhanced capacities, violates the principle or equality. It does not. (3) Disability or impairment must be defined relative either to normalcy, \"normal species functioning\", or \"species typical functioning\". It is not necessarily so defined.",

It was predicted and found that subjects did not hold negative attitudes to aging per se but such attitudes were influenced by negative environmental conditions (un controllability and institutionalization) associated with aging and which have been found to actually promote physical and psychological decline.

Persistent stalking can lead to an increase in the victim's feelings of fear and anxiety. Individuals exposed to this situation may experience psychological and/or physical health problems. According to researches, persistent stalking is a sexist act. The victims are mostly women. Stalking actions are generally carried out by men whom women know and have emotional relationships with. The difference between being a perpetrator or a victim in stalking actions depending on gender change also causes the formation of stalking myths in countries. In this study, stalking, which is a very current concept in the field of forensic sciences, was examined in terms of some sociological variables.

      "title": "Social Loneliness after Divorce: Time-Dependent Differential Benefits of Personality, Multiple Important Group Memberships, and Self-Continuity",
      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Critical events in the second half of life, such as divorce, pose a significant threat to well-being. Individuals undergoing divorce often experience feelings of social loneliness and may benefit differently from available resources depending on how much time has passed since the event. Personality traits have been found to be related to adaptation, with particularly strong effects immediately after the critical event. Other resources, such as identity-stabilizing mechanisms (i.e., valued social groups and self-continuity), may play a role only later in adaptation. However, little is known about the benefits of these resources and their potentially time-dependent effects on social loneliness when one is overcoming later-life divorce. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objectives:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This study investigates the role of psychological (e.g., personality, self-continuity, multiple important group memberships) and social resources (e.g., new partner, having someone to help deal with divorce) for social loneliness in two post-divorce phases, using a married group as the reference, controlling for sociodemographic aspects and health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A representative sample of 850 divorced (aged 40–79 years) and 869 married individuals (aged 40–78 years) living in Switzerland were compared, using multiple regression analyses. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Differential predictive patterns for social loneliness between the two divorced groups and the married group were observed. For the short-term divorced (up to 2 years after divorce), higher extroversion and agreeableness and lower neuroticism were associated with lower levels of loneliness. For the long-term divorced (2–5 years after divorce) and for those who remained married, extroversion was similarly important for loneliness. Additionally, higher levels of self-continuity and multiple group memberships predicted lower loneliness, but the short-term divorced did not benefit from them. Having someone to help overcome the divorce benefited members of both divorced groups. A new partner was related to less loneliness, but only in the long-term divorced group. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Our findings demonstrate that the effects of psychological and social resources on social loneliness vary by adaptation phase. Although extroversion is beneficial for all divorced and married individuals, other personality traits play a more decisive role in the initial adaptation phase. Identity-promoting resources (i.e., multiple group memberships, perceived self-continuity) are beneficial only later in the adaptation process. To be successful, professional interventions must be tailored as needed.",

      "abstract": "Dating violence is characterized by any form of violence or threat from one partner to the other within a romantic relationship. This type of violence can be identified in any dating relationship regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Females are more often the targets of dating violence than males, especially in regard to severe physical and sexual violence. Dating violence includes physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. Young females may be more vulnerable to sexual violence for a number of reasons. They may avoid talking to family members in the belief that their family will not listen to their issues, or may prefer to talk to their peers, who often show sympathy but have little life experience. The situation of victims from minority cultural groups may be even worse because violence in a dating relationship may be combined with racism, sexism, and discrimination. Family members, friends, teachers, school counselors, police officers, and religious leaders can play a key role in preventing this type of violence before it occurs or in helping survivors of dating violence. Feminist scholars have played a significant role in making the academic community and the public aware of violence in romantic relationships as a result of the hierarchical form of male power and control over the lives of women. In the United States, many policy programs and projects have been successfully developed and implemented in order to prevent dating violence and support its survivors.",

Furthermore, age differences in anxiety and attitudes were found. There was no indication that the age differences in conflicts and misconducts were due to age differences in the ability to cope with the environment. However, there was some evidence that attitudes may differentially effect the behavior of inmates of different ages. Stronger attitudes reflecting either fear or victimization or the need to assert oneself in interactions with others led to more interpersonal conflicts at any age but only the youngest responded in manner leading to punishment by the institution.",

      "abstract": "Opposition is a common form of behaviour in adolescence, a sign of the process of self-affirmation and the quest for independence. The narcissistic foundations formed during early childhood are particularly tested at this age. They constitute a narcissistic filter protecting against invasion by the object or its deficiencies. When they are weak or deficient, opposition may take a pathological and restrictive turn, penalizing family and social inscription. This frequently occurs with adopted adolescents. The authors emphasize the reasons why the situation of adoption is liable to undermine both primary and secondary narcissistic foundations. Opposition has the effect of making imperious demands on the object while at the same time keeping it at a distance, and has more to do with taking pleasure in mastering or controlling the object than in sharing with the object. The analysis of two clinical case histories of adopted adolescents will help to highlight certain aspects of this problem. One case concerns a narcissistic confrontation owing to the mother’s alcoholism and depression in the absence of paternal regulation; the other concerns a refusal to attend school and the development of a negative identity in response to a traumatic family situation undermining the status of the adolescent’s identity. In both these situations, the “work of the negative” in Green’s sense is highlighted.",

      "title": "Discrimination and the Role of the Clinician",
      "abstract": "Recognizing and confronting discrimination is essential to eliminating health disparities. Healthy People 2030 highlights discrimination when addressing social determinants of health.1 In this issue of Pediatrics, Lei et al2 contribute to the growing literature that discrimination adversely impacts mental health in young adults. The authors investigated the effect of discrimination (racism, sexism, ageism, physical appearance, other) over time on mental health, substance use, and well-being. Data analysis using the Transition to Adulthood Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics revealed that increased discrimination frequency was associated with higher levels of mental illness diagnosis, psychological distress, substance use, and languishing for up to 6 years after initial exposure.2 Clinicians should know 3 aspects vital to combating discrimination in health care: the impact of interpersonal discrimination, the role of implicit bias in perpetuating disparities, and decolonizing medical education and training.First, interpersonal discrimination (sometimes called individual discrimination) refers to conscious or unconscious acts of prejudice committed by a member of a dominant or privileged group toward a member(s) of a marginalized group. Acts of interpersonal discrimination (ie, microaggressions) can manifest as lack of respect toward a person as well as marginalizing, undervaluing, and scapegoating a person. Experiences with acts of interpersonal discrimination have been found to contribute to poor mental health and physical health outcomes in children, adolescents, young adults, and adults. Within the health care setting, this can include making disparaging comments to a patient or colleague about their weight, accented speech, name, or religious affiliation.3–6 Acts of interpersonal discrimination in health care also include failing to provide translation services for patients who are fluent in languages other than spoken English; making assumptions about a patient's intelligence on the basis of their economic status, educational level, or geographic origin; or refusing to see patients who are members of sexual or gender minority groups.7–9Secondly, acknowledging, mitigating, and eliminating the impact of implicit biases within the health care system is critical. Evidence suggests that clinicians endorse negative implicit biases toward race, sex, weight, age, and mental illness that are similar to those in the general population.10 Studies have found that clinicians' negative implicit biases influence how they communicate with their patients, influence the treatments they recommend, and influence patient satisfaction ratings.11 The Joint Commission report on implicit bias in health care suggested useful strategies for addressing implicit bias, including perspective-taking (the cognitive aspect of compassion that can reduce bias and deter unconscious stereotypes and prejudices), emotional self-regulation (experiencing positive emotions during patient encounters to build rapport, trust, and connection), and partnership building (working collaboratively with patients toward a common goal).12Lastly, we must address bias and discrimination in trainee curricula and continuing medical education. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) included in the Common Program Requirements that a trainee must demonstrate competence in \"respect and responsiveness to diverse patient populations, including but not limited to diversity in gender, age, culture, race, religion, disabilities, national origin, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.\"13 ACGME has 6 core educational competencies, but none specifically address bias, discrimination, and inequity. To fill this training gap, a new ACGME competency has been proposed: Structural Competency, Health Equity, and Social Responsibility.14 This includes 3 subthemes that address knowledge, skills, and attitudes: structural competency (eg, understand implicit and/or explicit race and/or gender bias and its effects on health outcomes, health inequities, and patient care), structural action (eg, incorporate direct interventions on patients' social and structural determinants of health into all physician functions), and structural responsibility (eg, examine the ethics of patient care decisions, with a focus on structural vulnerability and reducing the inequities faced by historically marginalized and oppressed populations).14 The American Board of Pediatrics has an updated entrustable professional activity for general pediatrics, number 14, entitled \"Use Population Health Strategies and Quality Improvement Methods to Promote Health and Address Racism, Discrimination, and Other Contributors to Inequities Among Pediatric Populations\" to address racism, other social determinants of health, clinician bias, and health inequities.15 This entrustable professional activity is focused on the following: clinician personal responsibility to their community and society, identifying populations at risk for poor health outcomes, cooperating with diverse stakeholders on creating and implementing initiatives to improve health outcomes, analyzing data from various resources for quality improvement and/or population health initiatives, and undoing the systems and processes that are rooted in discrimination that have led to health care inequities.15 To mitigate the influence of implicit biases on clinical decision-making, researchers from the Royal College of Physicians have suggested a checklist for determining if clinicians' biases influence clinical decision-making.16 This checklist includes items that analyze how one reached a diagnosis and whether stereotypes were used.16Interpersonal discrimination contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes for children, adolescents, and adults. Clinician biases and discriminatory actions in practice and/or in training against patients based on their demographic characteristics can lead to serious health consequences. Clinicians play a central role in recognizing and addressing interpersonal discrimination in health care settings and during patient encounters. Institutions have a responsibility of addressing interpersonal discrimination within the work environment and with patient care activities. Committing to reducing and eliminating interpersonal discrimination in health care will promote a healthier society.",

Juvenile delinquency refers to adolescent behavior that is not in accordance with the norms that live in the community. In terms of juvenile delinquency law is classified into two groups relating to legal norms, namely: (1) delinquency that is immoral and social and is not regulated in law so it can not or is difficult to be classified as a violation of law; (2) delinquency which is unlawful with the settlement in accordance with the law and applicable law is the same as unlawful conduct if committed by an adult. Furthermore culture or culture derived from Sanskrit is buddhayah, which is the plural form of buddhi (mind or intellect) is defined as matters relating to the mind and human reason. In English, culture is called culture, which comes from the Latin word Colere, which is to process or work, so that juvenile delinquency in cultural perspective is very visible relation. Teenagers should be able to get as many adults as possible who would motivate good behavior as well as people who have improved after failing at this stage. The existence of motivation from family, teachers, peers is something that can be done to overcome juvenile delinquency and also good for the development of adolescents.

      "abstract": "In adolescence, the system of values, the ways to find pleasure, the experience of being loved, being a male or a female, are put to the test due to the presence of sexually mature body. In many cases, what goes relatively smoothly in normal development can be stressful for some adolescents. Despite that, adolescents find ways to respond and to use their experiences constructively, in an effort and with a desire to enter the social and sexual world of adults. Still, there are adolescents whose experiences are completely different and whose adolescence is riddled with problems. They live haunted by their own fantasies and no matter how much they try to keep the cause of suffering or hatred outside themselves, they inevitably face the experience of their bodies being the source of abnormality and of not being able to do much else but giving in to illness. Crucial change that should take place in adolescence for an individual to reach psychic maturity is the weakening of relations with primary objects, which enables the creation of new object relations. In self-harming adolescents, however, there is inability to give up the bond with the mother - any internal attempt to break this bond brings the feeling of unbearable loss. Basically, the adolescent's relationship with their mother is highly ambivalent, and the feelings fluctuate from intense hatred to intense love. Careful monitoring brings up the conclusion that these are narcissistic personalities with primitive and punishing superego. In this article, we have used the psychoanalytic theoretical concepts as a basis for understanding the psychopathology and psychodynamics of adolescents whose act of intentional and conscious attacking of one's own body is one of the main reasons for seeking psychiatric help, which will be illustrated by presenting individual and milieu therapy of an adolescent girl treated at the Day Hospital for Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health.",

Social ethics arises in everyone, according to their nature and character. Human nature can be seen from their actions in treating and respecting others, especially treating the opposite sex, not in accordance with ethics and social sense, then the person is considered disrespectful to others. The literature study is the method used in this study is to have a purpose to know gender and its equality be the cause of violence against women, and its relation to social ethics. The result is a patriarchal culture that assumes that men as rulers, while women are in a weak position or are perceived as \"male\" owners, and social ethics greatly affect respect for women, where social ethics strongly determines one's behavior and how to respect and respect for women's rights.",

      "abstract": "Some kinds of risk-taking in the pursuit of pleasure or the improvement of work performance are considered socially and legally acceptable. Drug use is not, except for alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. This is certainly not because the dangers of drugs have been carefully compared with other kinds of danger, and not even because the risks of legal drug use have been carefully balanced against the benefits, or against the cost of enforcing punitive laws. Ironically, if we did those things, alcohol and tobacco might be the first drugs banned. But this kind of reckoning is regarded, in effect, as too difficult and uncertain. Instead, social and legal policy is guided by certain unconscious analogies, whereas others are ignored or rejected. The analogies we actually use are not entirely misleading, but they are partial; in this case they justify severe social disapproval and legal restraints that we would not tolerate for equivalent dangers not produced by drugs. It is useless to protest against this in the name of abstract consistency and rationality; the current drug control arrangements and their justifying analogies have the weight of all twentieth century history behind them, and they are similar everywhere in the world. They are the accepted and perhaps inevitable response, in our time, to a social need for classification and control of a complicated and ambiguous phenomenon.

The Polish Psychiatric Society tabled a motion in favour of abolishing this regulation, but the penal code reform committee did not accept this postulate. It is worth noting that sexual partnership constitutes both for men and women an irreplaceable human right. Nature itself does not exclude the mentally ill from the mystery of life which is unpredictable in its destiny. It should be added that some of the mentally ill identify hope for further living with the hope of keeping an intimate partnership.",

Expressions of sexuality include style of dress, values, and attitudes as well as hugging, touching, kissing, acting out scenarios/fantasies, sex toys, masturbation, sexual intercourse, and oral genital stimulation, either alone or with another. Regardless of one's role in providing care to patients, most practitioners do not have experience about discussing sexuality and intimacy in a frank, direct, and authentic manner. Addressing sexuality issues early on in the assessment and treatment of the patient allows the practitioner to open up a line of communication with the patient so that these issues can be addressed as they come up in the future. People with advanced cancer reported a high prevalence of unmet needs related to their sex lives and a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction.",

      "title": "Editorial: Controlling ourselves: insights into the development of psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Controlling yourself is far more easily said than done. It takes years of experience and biological maturation to even acquire the basic skills to get it right, and there is no simple formula for getting from infancy to adulthood with good self-regulation skills in place. It is a very complex business, involving opportunities and pitfalls along the way. Yet the establishment of self-regulation is arguably one of the most dramatic markers of healthy development. From early in life, the brain develops in tandem with changing social influences, resulting in typical and healthy cognitive, sensory-motor and social-emotional functioning. Yet the presence of a host of biological and environmental risks sometimes disrupts this developmental course. These disruptions are in part responsible for the emergence of a wide range of symptoms arising from mental and behavioral disorders. Although adolescents and especially children (when compared to adults) are still developing their self-regulation skills, they are much like adults in the extent of individual differences in their underlying self-regulatory capacities. Similarly, different disorders show distinct patterns of self-regulatory deficits or adaptations. This variation is expressed at many levels, from neural activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems, to modulation of visual attention, to control of cognitive or emotional events, to broad and easily observed behaviors. Understanding these variations - within and between the different levels of brain, cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity - will yield important insights into the nature and consequences of psychopathology, and provide better roadmaps to new interventions and improvements in existing treatments (Posner & Rothbart, 2007). In their annotation, Banaschewski and Brandeis provide many examples of research that is providing new methods for studying the development of childhood disorders. Their review emphasizes the strengths and limitations of using measures of electrophysiology to test for individual and disorder-group differences in brain activation patterns that reflect the real-time processing of information and the control and regulation of those processes. This methodology and field of research is maturing rapidly, and promises to yield powerful information regarding etiology of disorders and effects of intervention, especially when coupled with traditional behavioral assessments of symptoms. Investigation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity – our body's first response to danger or stress - opens another window into the developing self-regulatory capacity of children and adolescents and its role in psychopathology. Using skin conductance reactivity as a measure of SNS functionality, Cummings and colleagues found that the effects of paternal and maternal depressive symptoms on children's developing behavioral and emotional problems were dependent on the degree of children's SNS reactivity, with highly reactive children showing the strongest effects. Accordingly, practitioners should be aware of risks to healthy self-regulation arising from fathers’ as well as mothers’ depressive symptoms. Moreover, some children may be more vulnerable than others, depending on their stable physiological responses – and poor regulation of those responses – to stressors and particular family contexts (e.g. paternal depression). These findings point to the importance of considering children's reactivity to stress as well as the broader family environment in determining directions for assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Moving from the analysis of SNS functioning to behavioral measures of cognitive control, Hardin and colleagues examined the role of incentives (money in this case) in influencing adolescents’ and adults’ performance in a visual attention task. They compared the youth and adults, as well as sub-groups of youth with anxiety or depression, and found evidence of developmental and diagnostic group differences in the degree of cognitive control and sensitivity to reward, as they related to improvements in performance. Anxious and depressed adolescents showed impaired regulation of eye movements during the task, as well as a dampened response to incentives, compared to the healthy adolescents and adults. If replicated, these results have important implications for the way in which clinicians utilize and evaluate the use of incentives for improving treatment outcomes with mood and anxiety disordered youth - particularly in light of the predominance of cognitive-based therapies for these disorders. Another example of dysfunctional self-regulation can be seen in the comorbidity of ADHD and reading disability. The paper by Bental and Tirosh highlights the need to measure attention and executive functions in youth who show evidence of reading disorder, as well as the assessment of working memory and information processing speed (i.e. rapid naming of objects or numbers) when considering ADHD symptomatology. Their study of Hebrew-speaking children and young adolescents revealed that the co-diagnosis of reading disorder and ADHD is predicted by the combination of slow processing speed and poor working memory, and also points to the importance of attention regulation to reading performance and efficiency. A similar lesson can be learned by reading Reiersen and colleagues’ paper on the connections between ADHD diagnosis and autistic symptoms in childhood and adolescence. The presentation of autistic symptoms in some children with ADHD previously has been noted by clinicians, but as these researchers emphasize in their paper most diagnostic taxonomies (including DSM-IV) do not permit co-diagnosis of ADHD and pervasive developmental disorder. Reiersen and colleagues have confirmed the presence of severe autistic behaviors in many children with ADHD in a twin sample derived from population-wide birth records. Clinically significant levels of autistic traits were most common among youth with a combined type ADHD diagnosis. These findings reinforce the importance of assessing and treating severe disruptions in social responsiveness and related social impairments in children with ADHD. So what do clinicians and other practitioners gain by adding to their ‘‘toolbox’’ a bio-behavioral framework, when considering the role of dysfunctional self-regulation in the development of disorders? As is evident in these papers, there is some potential in the underlying theories and methodologies used in this work for determining brain-behavior mechanisms - and doing so with much greater precision than has been allowed in the past. For example, clinicians want to know whether the treatments they are utilizing result in meaningful and lasting improvements in functioning. But within any group of youth (for any disorder in question), there is almost always a wide range in response to treatment and long-term progress following intervention. With more proximal and precise measures of the underlying brain mechanisms involved in self-regulation of cognitions, emotions and behavior – as well as a more thorough understanding of how these bio-mechanisms transact with the social environment – change in these bio-social processes can be studied. My prediction is that in the not too distant future, we will be able to use these tools to measure change in regulation and symptoms at multiple levels of analysis (e.g. brain activation, working memory, observed behavior), and also will be equipped with a precision of measurement and specificity of theory that will allow us to designate sub-groups of individuals who are most or least likely to respond well to readily available treatment options. Readers of JCPP are exposed to a broad range of topics presented within excellent theoretical and empirical studies, and the current issue is no exception. The studies described above are complemented by other outstanding papers addressing contexts, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of a variety of disorders and symptom profiles, ranging from autism to conduct problems to somatic problems.",

      "abstract": "Hardly any subjects enjoy greater – public or private – interest than the art of flirtation and seduction. However, interpersonal approach behavior not only paves the way for sexual interaction and reproduction, but it simultaneously integrates non-sexual psychobiological and cultural standards regarding consensus and social norms. In the present paper, we use script theory as a concept that extends across psychological and cultural science to assess behavioral options during interpersonal approaches. Specifically, we argue that approaches follow scripted event sequences that entail ambivalence as an essential communicative element. On the one hand, ambivalence may facilitate interpersonal approaches by maintaining and provoking situational uncertainty, so that the outcome of an action – even after several approaches and dates – remains ambiguous. On the other hand, ambivalence may increase the risk for sexual aggression or abuse, depending on the individual's abilities, the circumstances, and the intentions of the interacting partners. Recognizing latent sequences of sexually aggressive behavior, in terms of their rigid structure and behavioral options, may thus enable individuals to use resources efficiently, avoid danger, and extricate themselves from assault situations. We conclude that interdisciplinary script knowledge about ambivalence as a core component of the seduction script may be helpful for counteracting subtly aggressive intentions and preventing sexual abuse. We discuss this with regard to the nature-nurture debate as well as phylogenetic and ontogenetic aspects of interpersonal approach behavior and its medial implementation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Attachment describes the human infant's tendency to seek comfort, support, nurturance, and protection from a relatively small number of preferred caregivers or attachment figures. The capacity to form an attachment is not present at birth, but develops over time. Although infants in the first 6 months are able to distinguish among different interactive partners, they do not express an obvious preference for one caregiver over another. All of this changes at around 7 to 9 months of age. At that point, infants begin to exhibit stranger wariness and separation protest, two behaviors that herald the onset of focused attachment. Stranger wariness varies from mild reticence to outright distress, but it contrasts with the infant's comfort with an attachment figure, from whom the infant seeks comfort, support, nurturance, and protection. Separation protest describes the infant's reaction to actual or anticipated separation from an attachment figure. After these two behaviors appear, infants are attached to one or more caregivers. Once infants have developed the cognitive capacity to exhibit separation protest and stranger wariness, they may form new attachments with any caregivers with whom they have significant interactive experiences.",

      "title": "Recognition of Sexual Abuse in Children",
      "abstract": "Although sexual abuse of children has likely been present for ages, its recognition in the United States and other countries has dramatically increased in the past 5 years. Reported cases, which represent an unknown fraction of actual cases, now account for approximately 25% of all abuse and neglect reports. Local, county, and state agencies are staggering under the load, and many are relying heavily on pediatricians to assist them in their work. DEFINITION Sexual abuse can be defined as the engaging of a child in sexual activites that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the social taboos of society. This definition is broad and includes intrafamilial and extrafamilial forms and all types of sexual activities (eg, exhibitionism, fondling, child pornography, oral, anal, and genital sexual contact). The interface between \"normal sexual exploratory behavior\" and \"sexual abuse\" is not clearly defined. Pediatricians should, however, use common sense. If two 4-year-old children are found to be playing without clothes, touching each others' genitals and giggling, there is probably little to worry about. The same is true if two 15-year-old adolescents are discovered together. A probably exists if the 15-year-old child (some states set statutory 2- to 4-year limits within which sexual activities are not to be considered abuse) or if one 4-year-old child is engaging in fellatio or attempting intercourse with another preschool-aged child.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the vulnerable triangle of mentalizing, attachment, and social learning, different forms of child attachment insecurity can influence the development of epistemic trust. Avoidantly attached individuals will often close themselves off: epistemic mistrust. Anxious-ambivalently attached individuals often rely too heavily on one attachment figure and have developed too little autonomy, to suspend that trust when necessary. That makes them vulnerable to entanglement in dependent relationships. They are epistemically hypervigilant towards almost everyone, but epistemically naive towards that one attachment figure who knows how to reach them. Disorganized attached individuals are often deeply confused and isolated. They dare not trust themselves or others. These learning dispositions influence the contact they have with others. Often such people come across as quite rigid and closed, while securely attached people, with a healthy dose of epistemic trust and epistemic vigilance, are flexible in their thoughts and actions, and open to the other.",

      "title": "Defective Social Intelligence as a Factor in Crime",
      "abstract": "STUDIES OF causal factors in criminal behavior have multiplied rapidly in the last half century. We cannot review the major or the more recent of these studies. Suffice it to say that many of them have suffered from a too heterogeneous selection of cases. The endless complexities entering into the behavior patterns of varied age groups, of varied nationalities, of varied cultures, of different stages of criminal behavior, almost preclude scientific findings. A second serious limitation is that the different determinants of criminal behavior almost invariably have been studied as unitary, e.g., such factors as lack of home restraint, or urban conditions of life, or the thwarting of the social wishes, or emotional imbalance, have been listed with little or no reference to the cultural world nor to the changes in the role of personality which influence the behavior pattern. This situation does not mean that students of criminology do not fully appreciate the intricate complexities of criminal behavior. There is considerable intellectual appreciation and much profound academic discussion, but there has been little actual collection and use of facts on a large scale under controlled conditions. The obstacles encountered in studies of closely interrelated multiple factors, viewed as a Gestalt, even of a more or less homogeneous group of offenders, are numerous and complex. The writer, therefore, offers the following preliminary study in a series of other studies of adult offenders, with considerable hesitancy. Two thousand consecutive probation records of men who had applied for probation at the Los Angeles County Probation Department during I933 were taken for study.' These records revealed the following facts: 57 percent were under 30 years of age; 75 percent were native-born; 86 percent were non-transients; 59 percent were reared by both parents and 83 percent were reared at home by one or both parents; 45 percent had completed at least grammar school and 63 percent had more than eighth but less than twelfth grade education; 65 percent were Protestants; go percent were of normal intelligence; 95 percent were in good health at the time of arrest; 56 percent had committed crimes against property, that is, they were charged with burglary, robbery, grand larceny, auto theft, forgery, and embezzlement. Ninety percent admitted the use of intoxicants, and 30 percent admitted the use of alcohol to excess; only 2 percent admitted the use of drugs.",

      "abstract": "Humans are social animals; consequently, a lack of social ties affects individuals’ health negatively. However, the desire to belong differs between individuals, raising the question of whether individual differences in the need to belong moderate the impact of perceived social isolation on health. In the present study, 77 first-year university students rated their loneliness and health every 6 weeks for 18 weeks. Individual differences in the need to belong were found to moderate the relationship between loneliness and current health state. Specifically, lonely students with a high need to belong reported more days of illness than those with a low need to belong. In contrast, the strength of the need to belong had no effect on students who did not feel lonely. Thus, people who have a strong need to belong appear to suffer from loneliness and become ill more often, whereas people with a weak need to belong appear to stand loneliness better and are comparatively healthy. The study implies that social isolation does not impact all individuals identically; instead, the fit between the social situation and an individual’s need appears to be crucial for an individual’s functioning.",

Sexual problems may be caused or exacerbated by the diagnosis, investigation, and management of infertility (or subfertility), or they may be a contributory factor in childlessness. Any examination of a couple's difficulty in conceiving must include overt and clear questioning about their sexual activity. ### Responses to infertility In response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may have several effects on sexual activity. The stress of infertility and its treatment may be a cause of sexual difficulties for both the prospective father and mother. Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established, so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem. Postcoital tests or having to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, adversely affecting his erectile or ejaculatory ability. For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begins a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures. Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress. Some individuals feel that their partner seems to want them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control. #### Useful questions to elicit information",

Symptoms evolved throughout adolescence and adulthood with persistent identity diffusion, intense abandonment fears, feelings of chronic emptiness and guilt, mood swings, unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, impulsivity and self-destructive behaviour. Gender history and transition: No evidence of gender nonconformity, gender dysphoria, gender-role discomfort or cross-gender identification. Uncertainty regarding male's role and identity diffusion, persisting since puberty. An impulsive decison for SRS and facial plastic surgery at the age of 40 (performed abroad), without a recommendation letter, motivated by the urge to resolve identity confusion and diminish compulsive sexual behaviour. He subsequently acknowledged his male identity, which led to relief of symptoms and request for sex-reconversion surgery. Gender history and clinical presentation confirmed that the patient did not sufficiently meet criteria for Gender Identity Disorder, but rather for Borderline Personality Disorder. The authors are highly aware that this topic is significantly connected to issues of the human right to free choice; however we would wish to impose a medical obligation for a rigorous psychiatric assessment for origin of gender identity diffusion and discomfort.

Se entiende como estigma una caracteristica que por lo general implica una connotacion negativa. Este rasgo caracteristico puede ser la apariencia fisica, una caracteristica emocional o de personalidad o un patron etnico-racial. Habitualmente, estos rasgos se consideran una amenaza o generan perturbacion en el contexto social o en los patrones de valores aceptados como dignos de ser reproducidos o preservados (1). El prejuicio proviene de una construccion colectiva en la que se acepta la caracteristica senalada como indeseable o poco valiosa y, simultaneamente, se considera que todas las personas con el rasgo senalado como negativo representan un conjunto homogeneo, es decir, que las personas incluidas en esa categoria son iguales (2). Finalmente, la discriminacion aparece en el momento en que se institucionaliza la exclusion o la marginacion de las personas que llevan el estigma y sobre quienes persiste un prejuicio. La discriminacion en si misma implica una negacion de los derechos de las personas (1,2).",

      "abstract": "To a healthy child who has been well trained, nothing appears more easy than to be happy; to a child who has been badly trained, whose infant years have been neglected or motherless, nothing appears more difficult. There is often something in the bodily constitution, too, which stands in the way of individual happiness, without our being sensible of any actual disease; and the mother ought to watch carefully every symptom of this nature as indications of growing evil, which may frustrate much of the good she naturally looks forward to in the future experience of her child. She ought especially to observe, if, when the family group are loudest in their mirth, there is one who falls back from the cheerful circle, and who, instead of catching the natural infection of laughter and glee, sits moping alone, with cloudy brow, and drooping head, as if incapable of partaking in the general feeling. Such a tendency as this, is generally to be attributed to some bodily indisposition, of which perhaps the child is not aware; but it may also arise from a peculiarity of temperament, only to be accounted for upon the principle that there are diseases of mind, as well as body, the seeds of which are inherent in our nature.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract The lack of an effective HIV vaccine or other biomedical intervention means that behavioural change will continue to be critical to the prevention of HIV infection. Despite near universal knowledge of HIV and sexual safety, and widespread intentions to be safe, rates of unprotected sex and HIV sero-conversion remain high among gay and bisexual men. Explanatory models that link risk-taking and prevention to rational processes such as knowledge, social norms, behavioural intentions, or perceived vulnerability to infection, cannot fully account for the continued risk behaviours observed in virtually all cohorts of gay men. We feel that innovative conceptions of risk and risk prevention are needed, that emphasize non-rational, affective processes in risk-taking and decision-making. Consistent with recent models from social psychology, we propose that for many people sexual risk does not stem from a lack of community norms or personal standards, but from a desire to escape cognitive awareness of very rigorous norms and standards. Being self-aware of HIV risk arouses anxiety and precludes highly-desired activities: fatigue, fatalism, or other negative affect over HIV may lead people to 'cognitively disengage' within the sexual situation, and not to follow their norms or intentions toward safety. We propose that both substance use and the approach of high stimulation or other sexual settings facilitates this cognitive disengagement, wherein people enact 'automatic' sexual scripts and or become more responsive to external pressures toward risk. We briefly review current psychosocial models of HIV risk behaviour, outline a cognitive escape model with particular emphasis on substance use as a behavioural risk factor, and discuss implications of an escape model for behavioural interventions among gay and bisexual men.",

The gold standard for determining what constitutes due care in any particular situation is what a reasonable person, similarly situated, would do. Determinations of due care are necessarily fact specific. Nevertheless, the general objective is to strike an appropriate balance between an unrealistically high standard of caution and one that fails to take into account the known or foreseeable risks of any human endeavor. The same standard applies to individuals regardless of their age (so long as they have reached majority), gender, race, and level of education or economic status. The standard also applies to fictional “persons” such as corporations. The usual or prevailing custom and practice in an industry or occupation may provide relevant evidence of what constitutes “due care” in the activities common to it, but that evidence can be effectively overcome or rebutted by competent, credible evidence that the custom and practice either diverges from what it has been asserted to be or that the custom and practice is itself unsafe or otherwise poses an unreasonable risk of harm to others. Until quite recently, a singular exception to this general principle of tort law was made for the medical profession. We will consider this exception in the next section.",

These traits are perceived in ways that create experiences and risks of stigmatisation, discrimination, violence and harmful medical practices intended to promote social and familial integration. Like all stigmatised populations, a range of different language is used to describe intersex bodies, but many individuals with these traits lack a vocabulary to understand themselves. Dominant frameworks treat people with intersex traits as disordered and in need of fixing and/or as an 'other' category of sex, in need of recognition. Neither approach respects the diversity of the population and differing personal values and preferences. Specific traits are sometimes associated with specific health issues, frequently including innate or iatrogenic infertility, while one trait can be fatal if not medicated. Attempts to promote the right to bodily integrity seek to distinguish medical interventions to promote physical health and wellbeing from harmful but still prevalent interventions grounded in gender stereotypes or ideas about social and familial integration. A small but growing number of jurisdictions are taking action to promote bodily integrity and the right to health.",

      "abstract": "Humans punish fairness violations both as victims and impartial third parties, which can maintain cooperative behavior. However, it is unknown whether similar motivations underlie punishment of unfairness in these two contexts. Here, we approach this question by focusing on how both types of punishment develop in children, asking: What motivates young children to punish in response to fairness norm violations? We explore two potential factors: The direct experience of unfair outcomes, and a partner’s fair vs. unfair intentions. Five- and seven-year-olds were given the chance to engage in both 2nd- and 3rd-party punishment in response to either intended or unintended fairness norm violations in a single paradigm. In both age groups, children were more likely to punish when they were directly affected by the allocation (2nd-party punishment) than when they were an uninvolved third party (3rd-party punishment). Reliable 3rd-party punishment was shown only in the older age-group. Moreover, children’s punishment was driven by outcome rather than intent, with equal rates of punishment when unequal outcomes were either the result of chance or the intentional act of another child. These findings suggest that younger children may be mainly motivated to create equal outcomes between themselves and others, while older children are motivated to enforce fairness norms as a general principle.",

      "abstract": "The number of pregnancies and induced abortions among Japanese teenagers has recently increased. 2 of 5 pregnant single women whom social workers assist are teenagers. The teenagers fall into 2 groups: those under 18, who are in a sexually awakening period, or 18 and older, who are maturing. Those under 18, despite a strong tendency toward sexual activity, are predominantly insecure and run away from home to escape adversity and seek friendship among members of the opposite sex. After becoming pregnant, they go home only to embarrass their parents. Ultimately, they choose abortion or, because of their own inability, their babies are taken care of by their families or in foster homes. Those 18 or older, despite their knowledge of the relationship between sexual intercourse and pregnancy, typically did not take it seriously. Consequently, their reaction to their pregnancies tends toward shock and panic. Many try to keep their pregnancy from their parents. Though they do not want abortion, their circumstances may force them to it. Behind the increase of unexpected pregnancy and unwanted abortion in both age groups are several factors: the lack of sexual education suitable to their level of their physical maturity; a lack of responsibility by the male teenagers, who cannot relate their own actions to their partners' pregnancies; and the ignorance of pregnant teenagers, who cannot see that abortions may hurt them not only physically but mentally in the long run.",

There are no indications that humour appreciation or production is associated with longevity. In older people there is a correlation between humour on the one hand and well-being and morale on the other. It has not been proven, however, that the use of humour by the elderly people has a favourable influence on their health. In health care for older people humour is sometimes used as a therapy. Scientific evidence of any positive effects of humour on mental health was not found. It is perhaps better for caretakers to show appreciation for the humour of older people than to make jokes about older people oneself.",

Impaired mental and emotional health is a precursor or consequence of many health-risk behaviors such as physical, sexual, social, or emotional abuse.

Such alternatives characterize problems of self-control. For example, at any given moment, a person may accept alcoholic drinks yet also prefer being sober to being drunk over the next few days. Other situations present choices between (a) alternatives beneficial to an individual and (b) alternatives that are less beneficial (or harmful) to the individual that would nevertheless be beneficial if chosen by many individuals. Such alternatives characterize problems of social cooperation; choices of the latter alternative are generally considered to be altruistic. Altruism, like self-control, is a valuable temporally-extended pattern of behavior. Like self-control, altruism may be learned and maintained over an individual's lifetime. It needs no special inherited mechanism. Individual acts of altruism, each of which may be of no benefit (or of possible harm) to the actor, may nevertheless be beneficial when repeated over time. However, because each selfish decision is individually preferred to each altruistic decision, people can benefit from altruistic behavior only when they are committed to an altruistic pattern of acts and refuse to make decisions on a case-by-case basis.",

Individuals are strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them are unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet, since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct to not trust the individuals with such preferences and to attempt to monitor or control them. However, most such efforts appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome.

      "abstract": "Every person goes through periods of low self-esteem at some stage in life, it’s unavoidable. Replacing this negative conditioning with more positive programming is critical to building a successful and harmonious life. Stress is perhaps the most common issue of man’s everyday life. Stress is so universal and widespread that it is considered as a hallmark of human life. Married women especially with responsibilities of job, children and ageing parents can particularly feel overwhelmed by stress of daily life and that might accentuate if women have lower esteem. Low self-esteem can lead to psychological effects that cause a person to be more susceptible to stressful situations. Conversely, high self-esteem can act as a sort of protection against high levels of stress. Individuals with low esteem tend to feel helpless, powerless, and incapable of overcoming the obstacles placed in front of them. People today suffer from stress in a range of situations. Stress is present in people’s lives and is believed to be the cause of psychopathologies, diseases, and inability to adapt to any given environment or work. Stress is considered a complex defensive-balancing mechanism of the body that develops in two stages: during the first stage, individuals assess the stressor and the demands stemming from it, and during the second stage, they evaluate whether or not they have enough resources to meet the stressor demands. The latter stage draws attention to the individual’s subjective assessment of the stressor, which conditions their reaction to it. Different people may react differently to the same stressor. The stress response refers to body reactions, which can either be physiological, emotional, or behavioral reactions to stimuli that cause stress.

      "abstract": "185 men and women representing five developmental ages ranging from younger to older adulthood (17 to 96 yr.) completed several measures to assess the amount and origins of most meaningful events in a person's life. As assessed by a modification of the Purpose-in-Life Test, the amount of purpose did not vary per se with age or sex. Similarly, the sources of meaning did not alter across time or sex. Themes of involvement emerged as the salient sources of meaning and included love, work, births of children, independent pursuits, accidents, illnesses, deaths, separations, or divorces, and to a lesser extent major purchases. The common sources and their timing are discussed within the context of a lifespan developmental model.",

      "abstract": "Genital human papillomavirus HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide, involving men and women of all ages, and is associated with poor health outcomes. Particularly during adolescence, this health problem assumes greater proportions due to the behavioral characteristics of adolescents, which make them a person at high risk of contracting this infection. As they are in the process of physical, emotional, sexual, and social maturation, adolescents exhibit risky behaviors due to the beginning of sexual activities driven by pubertal development, most of the time without proper preventive guidance, which predisposes them to contact with several viral and bacterial pathogens. Characteristics such as impulsiveness, indifference to risks and dangers, feeling of invulnerability, motivation to explore and seek novelty, and the need to face challenges and challenge rules and models, are part of the adolescent’s emotional development process, whose maturation is established as the limbic system and prefrontal cortex establish their role in controlling emotions. In addition, the possibility of relating to many partners with alternative sexual behaviors, the absence of circumcision, and the non-use of condoms contribute to increasing the risk of many infections. Given this scenario, it is essential that all the circumstances related to HPV, the vaccine, and the difficulties of its wide coverage are known, so that measures are implemented that aim to offer greater protection to the most vulnerable population.",

Having an SUD is not a matter of weakness, lack of willpower, or being “bad.” SUDs result from a complex interaction of genetic, psychological, social, and cultural factors. These disorders tend to run in families, so scientists believe a person inherits a predisposition or vulnerability to SUDs that interacts with environmental factors, increasing the risk of developing a problem. SUDs affect people of every age, race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and occupation. Some people develop a problem in early life, while others do so later in life. For some, a SUD develops gradually over years. For others, it happens quickly.",

      "abstract": "Relational by definition, grief is influenced by others’ witness, acknowledgement and validation. Although such influence has drawn sociological interest to the disenfranchised grief of marginalized groups, differential grief within the family goes mostly unaddressed in relational psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. Many factors influence the ranking of grief, including “proprietary rights” conferred by traditional roles and the psychodynamics of the family. In such situations, the more highly-ranked mourners may appropriate another’s grief by claiming a stronger sense of entitlement, conferred by felt anguish, attachment or social standing. Preempting another’s claim may come without conscious intention or even with intent to protect the other from such anguish. The self is injured when one’s right to grieve is withheld, overlooked or otherwise curtailed by others, or waived by oneself. Where one’s grief is deferred to mourners deemed more needy, deserving or powerful, a diminished sense of personal ownership of grief may present itself as generosity, guilt or compliance.",

Injury is different from accident in that the latter cannot be expected and prevented, and also different from trauma that means the external forces on the body and the response against the force. Injury can be expected scientifically and prevented. The risk of injuries in children is closely related to the age, sex, socio-economical status, and environment. Injuries are always the most common cause of death in children throughout the world, and traffic accident is the most common cause of childhood injuries. Burn, near drowning, and fall down occupy most of the causes of injuries in infancy, and pedestrian injuries and traffic accidents are the major causes of injuries in pre-school ages. Suicide becomes an important cause of injuries in adolescents. Sexual abuse should be considered seriously in children with perineal injuries without definite causes. All of these childhood injuries are closely related to the status of growth and development of children.",

      "abstract": "Clinically, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is described as primarily affecting personality and interpersonal conduct and resulting in social behavioral disruptions, thus often giving rise to interpersonal conflict. Conflict behavior in both typical and dementia populations is frequently identified as explicit physical and verbal acts such as assault, yelling or insulting, and research often situates conflict and collaboration as opposing dimensions. The premise of this article is to examine the unfolding of moments in which individuals diagnosed with FTD and their carers demonstrate opposing orientations towards an activity in real time interaction: A home nurse needing to fulfill an institutional agenda — taking sitting blood pressure — seeks the cooperation from an individual who, in attempting to lie down, interferes with this agenda. These moments constitute sources of interactional conflict that carers attempt to resolve. However, often conflict behavior and cooperative behavior are not neatly teased apart; for instance, individuals often display conflicting orientations towards an overarching or guiding activity while cooperating in more immediate and discrete interactional tasks. These verbal/nonverbal conflicts are not large acts of aggression; rather, they may be viewed as arising within the mundane moments of life that individuals face in everyday contexts and frequently.",

At the age of adolescence, namely the age range of 15 to 18 years adolescents will experiencethe first puberty, even some children experience puberty more quickly, which is around 10-13 years. In puberty,there is a strong urge that comes from within the individual to know something that he had neverknown. Circumstances like this that encourage adolescents in this case to try new things in life, including freesex (free sex). Sexual activity via mobile phones has now mushroomed in the community. Do not know thebeginning of when it began, but certainly there are many who know if sex can be done via cellular phone. Theactivity of having sex through a cellular phone is called phone sex. Telephone sex (Phone Sex) is a type ofvirtual sex that refers more to explicit sexual conversations that occur between two or more people over thetelephone especially when one participant or sex partner masturbates or performs sexual fantasies. Phone Sex (PS) is a sexual activity carried out by listening on a cellular phone.

      "title": "Behavioral Intervention with Child Abuse and Neglect",
      "abstract": "The range of factors identified as related to child maltreatment has expanded over the years. The literature clearly calls for an ecological approach in which individual, family, community, and societal factors are considered. The behavioral literature to date reflects an unevenness in terms of acceptance of such an approach. Studies are also uneven concerning the faithfulness with which hallmarks of a behavioral approach have been applied. These include individually tailored assessment and intervention based on empirical data and planning for generalization and maintenance. Most intervention programs do attend to positive as well as negative parent behaviors. Little attention is devoted to environmental characteristics, such as poverty level incomes and impoverished social support systems that may contribute to maltreatment. Lack of comprehensive assessment and intervention programs is no doubt responsible for the modest changes described in many reports. Behavioral studies suffer from uncritical acceptance of the term \"abuse\" or \"at risk\" in a number of ways, one of which is a failure to clearly describe the nature of the alleged maltreatment and the immediate situational context. Another is in the assumption that one particular factor is responsible for the maltreatment, such as ineffective parenting skills. Too often a label identifies only one characteristic of a person, ignoring other attributes and related factors. Like all deviant labels, the poor and minority groups are more likely to receive negative labels (Newberger et al., 1976). Investigaters have not taken advantage of relevant literature in the area of child welfare. Familiarity with this material would be helpful in avoiding myths in the field to which many have fallen prey, such as the myth of classlessness of child maltreatment. Acceptance of this myth interferes with the development of programs that deal with difficult environmental problems. Reports suggest that a behavioral approach is promising. Attention to enhancement of child management skills is supported by research that shows that most abuse occurs as an extension of parental discipline attempts. A focus on describing the relationships between behaviors of concern and what happens before and afterward has yielded valuable information concerning interaction patterns in abusive, neglectful, and normal families. Advantages of viewing child abuse in the general context of family interaction are illustrated by the work of Patterson and his colleagues and by Gelles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The paper raises the problem of the negative impact of patronizing attitude towards older people on their life practices, which is one of the manifestations of ageism. Patronizing behavior that is implemented towards the older generation in the form of simpli-fied language, exaggerated intonations, slow speech, a tendency to make decisions about the life of an elderly person, ignoring his opinion, etc., in turn, can have an infantilizing effect on the elderly person, forcing him to take a subordinate position. The study, based on empirical data, proves that this, in turn, causes self-limiting practices of older peo-ple. Representatives of the older generation who succumb to the influence of the negative social construct of old age transmitted by others, and as a result adopt a subordinate position, have higher risks of minimizing interpersonal, social and creative activity. Their way of life, in comparison with those who oppose the patronizing attitude or evaluate it negatively, is more focused on the “generally ac-cepted”. They are more likely to abandon their goals, plans, due to their own idea that at their age they are “not up to the task”, less often they act contrary to the opinion of others “about the right and wrong at this age”, refusing to defend their position. Accept-ing the patronizing attitude with gratitude, at the same time, they are more likely than those who are annoyed by this attitude to ignore health-saving practices, considering that diseases are an indis-pensable attribute of old age, so it is pointless to fight them. They are more likely to give up pleasures, joys, desired things in favor of younger people, con-sidering themselves unworthy of them. In conclu-sion, the article suggests ways to solve the identi-fied problem.",

Ability to perform specific functions improves for some and deteriorates for others. In addition, many individuals experience both types of functioning change at the same time—improvement in the ability to perform some functions and deterioration in ability to perform others. The covariates of functional improvement differ from those of functional loss. The return to functioning is most likely to occur when the overall functional status of the individual is higher, when the loss has been recent, and when the impairment is not severe. Decline in ability to perform specific functions is more likely when general health and functioning levels are lower and when a person has had a stroke, has arthritis, or has visual or auditory impairment. Age, race, and sex are related to the likelihood that functioning will deteriorate, but they have little effect on the likelihood of improvement.",

      "abstract": "At least 10 per cent of the world's people have a significant, long-term, physical or mental impairment which can and usually does disable them from taking part in the usual educational, social and economic activity in their community. This is due to barriers in attitudes, in the built environment and in the way society is organized, which prevent us from participating on an equal level with others. The reason why most of these barriers exist is because societies have until very recently not recognized that the systematic way in which they discriminate against disabled people when backed by discriminatory laws and practices of the state, often amounts to oppression. Barnes (1991) gives a full account of the discrimination disabled people encounter in all areas of life. This oppression has developed from our history, from myths and beliefs that attribute characteristics to disabled people which are unrelated to the reality of disabled people's lives. Such collections of attitudes often determine how non-disabled people respond to the 'different' in their midst; how they form stereotypes of the disabled person as saint, sinner, super-hero, freak, fiend, victim, obsessive avenger, isolationist, the butt of jokes, just a burden, or someone to be pitied. The particular form of stereotyped thinking depends on the society's history, its explanation of how it has come to be and the resultant culture.",

      "abstract": "Lesbian and bisexual women who are trying to recover from the destructive effects of both chemical dependency and homophobia/heterosexism face formidable problems and tasks. Many such women must struggle with other forces such as the devastating effects of terrible emotional/physical neglect or physical and/or sexual abuse, often inflicted within a chaotic chemically dependent family system. Many lesbian and bisexual women with long-term recovery are plagued by such major problems as eating disorders, dissociative disorders, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, compulsive debting/spending, sexual dysfunction, inability to be intimate, relationship problems, internalized homophobia, sexual identity confusion, and self-harming behaviors. A sense of defilement or stigma is unavoidable in the face of societal disgust and hatred both for those who are alcoholic and for those who are lesbian or gay or bisexual. Gay people who are subjected to the constant, ongoing totalitarian system of societal and familial homophobia intensified by their own personal, internalized homophobia learn to survive this emotional battering by \"numbing out.&quot",

In many countries, not much is published about child rearing and about possible child abuse and neglect. One or two official statistics are not adequate to show a low incidence of these conditions. Thirty years ago child abuse in the industrial world was thought to be uncommon. Only active public and professional concern led to the emergence of a truer picture of all forms of child abuse: physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional and nutritional failure to thrive owing to maternal deprivation. Child rearing is the essential element in the transmission of culture in any group or society.",

Also, it may be due to psychological disorder. Thus disability prevents from leading normal life. Physiologically disabled person can somehow tackle the various situations of life. But psychological disorder renders a person fully dependent on the mercy of the society. Disability may be due to heredity factors. Sometimes it is the outcome of leading fast life. A child is dependent. Similarly a disabled is also dependent. School children should visit the home for disabled. Then they will learn how to serve people. This noble feeling will pave their way for enjoying better life. If the disabled are rehabilitated properly then there will be no problem. Actually it depends upon the perception of the people and society as a whole. Such service to the ailing humanity enhances good wishes and awaken moral values already in man.

Research now demonstrates that typically such abuse goes on for decades, is frequently multi-generational and almost inevitably the father (or step-father) is part of some sort of organized abuse network. Victims of such abuse experience extreme fear and shame, are highly dissociative, highly conditioned, and in keeping with an enduring extreme attachment to their primary abuser typically feel fused with their father and indeed do not experience themselves as owning their own body. Invariably the father and other abusers are represented in their psyche in the form of dissociative identity states. This chapter highlights the enduring attachment to the father, the early manipulation of sexual responses and the ways in which a child abused from a very early age remains very controlled by the father with ongoing polymorphous extreme (usually sadistic) sexual abuse.",

      "abstract": "As the aforementioned national case law illustrates, situations of marital captivity come in many diﬀerent forms. The severity, legal and/or social impact and lived experiences, thus, are unique to each single case of marital captivity. The acquired social and legal status of ‘married’ or ‘divorcee’ are not merely expressions and conﬁrmations of one's legal identity, but they are also social constructions that continuously shape an individual's social identity and status. A limping personal status or having the status of being legally and or religiously married thus aﬀects the way in which individuals navigate through their social environment and interact with their community members. Consequently, the unsettled marital status of a trapped spouse may produce unnecessary restrictions for their eﬀective participation in social and community life and it may impair their personal development. So long as the still existing (religious) marriage has signiﬁcant legal and/or social signiﬁcance, it will continue to undermine the trapped spouse(s)’ ability and capacity to autonomously shape their lives. The autonomy of a trapped spouse, or rather the lack thereof, is the main and recurring deprivation in all situations of marital captivity.",

However, many of these studies have not accounted for the sexual identification of the participants sampled and have been limited in their conceptualization of religiosity. The religious context may be a source of conflict for some sexual minority individuals. As such, additional research is needed to examine the relationship between sexual minority religiosity and mental health. One-hundred and six sexual minority young adults (ages 18–24) were surveyed to examine the relationship between a multidimensional understanding of religiosity and sexual orientation conflict, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. While behavioral religiosity was generally not related to mental health outcomes, affective and cognitive measures of religiosity indicate both risk and protective benefit. These relationships are not moderated by either biological sex or years since self-identification as a sexual minority.",

Insome countries’ jurisdictions, male-female rape is the only form of rape counted in the statistics. many countries may not define forced and threat of violence sex on a spouse as “rape”. But those criminal acts are considered a crimein criminal law which belongs to those countries. Although rape is expressed the same in the legislation of different countries, it differs in some. rape as a crime is three the ways of commission crime. They are force, threat and sexual intercourse committed by abuse of helpless. Sometimes rape is committed by other means, with children, serious bodily injury and others. Some terms are used by legislation of different countries. They are: sexual act, sexual contact, force, threat, abuse of helpless, serious bodily injury from rape, by other means. Rape is committed by force or threat knowingly causes another person to engage in a sexual act by using force against that other person or by threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for any term of years or life, or both. On other hand rape is committed by other means knowingly renders another person unconscious and thereby engages in a sexual act with that other person or administers to another person by force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or permission of that person, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairs the ability of that other person to appraise or control conduct and engages in a sexual act with that other person or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for any term of years or life, or both. Rape is committed with children means that criminal act knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who has not attained the age of 12 years, or knowingly engages in a sexual act under the circumstances with another person who has attained the age of 12 years but has not attained the age of 16 years (and is at least 4 years younger than the person so engaging). But in the criminal code of Uzbekistan with children is considered in a sexual act with another person who has not attained the age of 14 years.&#x0D; This article illustrates that the ways commission ofrape, including the theoretical and practical problems of the ways commission of rape. As well as in this article are given relevant conclusions, suggestions and recommendations by the analysis of the criminal law of developed foreign countries (USA, Canada, England and Wales, New Zealand, Germany, France and Russia).&#x0D; In addition, proposals and recommendations for further improvement of the criminal legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan.",

The results were analysed in relation to sex and intelligence as assessed by the Stanford‐Binet Scale. The majority of children chose as their ideal characters personally unknown to them. Both sexes tended to choose male figures but boys mentioned a relatively greater proportion of characters associated with war, adventure, politics and sport, whereas girls chose a higher proportion of people distinguished because of moral or religious qualities. Less able children more often named as their ideal someone from their immediate circle of relatives or friends and gave fewer reasons for their choice than the more intelligent group. The most frequently mentioned 'wicked deeds' were murder, physical cruelty, stealing and cruelty to animals. Though the sexes showed considerable unanimity in their list of wicked actions, a higher proportion of girls than boys considered stealing, cruelty to animals, lying and swearing to be wicked. The most intelligent group produced a greater number and variety of morally wicked actions. The findings from the 'Moral Incidents' Test suggest that straightforward moral issues are readily understood by children but that the duller child's moral judgment is prone to become confused or blurred in the face of complexity or subtlety.",

In both male and female primates, cues from or interactions with conspecifics can inhibit reproductive development in juveniles, as well as reproductive physiology and sexual behavior in adults. In males, reproductive maturation may be delayed, and adult testosterone levels and sexual behavior are often reduced, in low‐ranking individuals compared to dominants. Female reproductive maturation can be delayed by the presence of a dominant female and/or the absence of an unrelated adult male, while numerous aspects of adult female reproductive function can be inhibited by cues from same‐sex rivals or adult males. Social suppression of reproduction appears to be a mechanism whereby individuals avoid investing in reproductive attempts that are likely to fail due to inauspicious social conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood of breeding successfully in the future.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Sexual abuse is an aspect of cruelty to children which merits greater scientific attention. It has potential for damaging the mental health of the victim and intergenerational cycles of this behaviour pattern may develop. The paediatrician is in a position to detect children at risk and may be able to intervene. Three types of sexual abuse are described (i) single sexual attacks which may be accompanied by physical violence: (ii) sexual exploitation of children for financial gain, and (iii) longstanding sexual relationships, generally between girls and father figures; these are far the most common. Although it is hard to separate the effects of premature sexual experience from other adverse environmental influences. the child victim of longstanding sexual abuse emerges immature, with considerable confusion as to her role in the family, and with constricted personality development. Her primary motivation is attention seeking, and she adopts sexual activity with an adult as a means of survival in often deplorable conditions. The sensitivity of management following the assault being made public is an important factor in determining eventual adjustment.",

On the one hand, we need one another; our happiness and well-being depend on establishing good relations with at least some human beings. On the other hand, we often fear others; we feel jealousy, envy, distrust, and even hate. In families and schools, we socialize children to conform to certain rules of behavior concerning the treatment of others and how to behave in social settings, but we rarely encourage a critical examination of the events and feelings that underlie the need for such rules. What is it about human nature and human social conditions that make these rules necessary? Should we question or even reject some of these rules?",

Ce trouble serait susceptible de mettre en danger la societe. Il pourrait resulter de la persistance, au-dela de la periode oedipienne, de la poussee dirigee vers la mere des pulsions sexuelles de la petite enfance. Nous avons appele cette poussee sexuelle incestuosite. Faute d'un controle suffisant de cette incestuosite, l'individu reste dans un etat plus ou moins fusionnel. La separation, necessaire a l'evolution et a l'entree dans le monde social, ne peut avoir lieu, d'ou un frein a l'elaboration de l'alterite, un refus de la castration et du tout n'est pas possible, une non reconnaissance de la loi sociale, facteur de triangulation et de separation. Ce trouble touche l'ensemble de la famille et se perennise souvent de generation en generation. Il nie totalement ou en partie la loi de la vie : impossible retour en arriere. A partir de cette conception etiologique des troubles consequence de l'incestuosite mal controlee, est proposee une prise en charge a but therapeutique, mais aussi preventif, dans le milieu ou se trouvent les individus (carceral, institutionnel, ouvert). Ce traitement peut s'adresser a tous les membres de la famille. Il ne les stigmatise pas comme incesteur, inceste(e), complice(s). Il permet une restructuration du sujet, soumis a la loi de la vie ou chaque etre est separe (accession a l'alterite), fait partie d'une societe (entree dans la triangulation) et ou tout n'est pas possible (castration)",

One does not give in publicly to a group, or modify one's way of viewing the environment, without resistance and confrontations. When two points of view appear irreconcilable their respective sponsors are inclined to engage in conflict. They do not do so light-heartedly, since any questioning of the social consensus on this or that issue promises trouble and suffering for the future. What is more, as reality does not generally tolerate two definitions at once, this conflict will lead either to abandonment of the position and public conformity (during the interaction) to a norm not really accepted so as to reach agreement on the issue, or to the maintenance of the position (coming to terms only with oneself or one's own group), the other viewpoint being treated as the deviant or abnormal one.",

      "title": "Verbal Abuse on Children: Does It Amount to Child Abuse under the Malaysian Law?",
      "abstract": "Children form an essential component of a society. The role of children has been acknowledged key to the survival, development as well as prosperity of that society. A child’s development stage is the most crucial and warrants serious attention from parents and teachers in order to assure their growth into mature adults, who are able to contribute to the society. One of the factors that may hamper their growth is child abuse. There are basically five main forms of child abuse known to take place in Malaysia namely physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect as well as abandonment. These forms of abuse have been given legal attention and recognition except emotional or psychological abuse. One common type of emotional abuse is verbal abuse, which is a form of abusive behavior involving the use of language. Alternatively known as reviling, it is a pattern of behavior that can seriously interfere with one’s positive emotional development and over time, it can lead to significant detriment to one’s self-esteem, emotional well-being and physical state. Although verbal abuse does not leave any outer mark or proof, a verbally abused victim usually suffers by having lower self-worth and low self-esteem. A child, who suffers verbal abuse may grow up to become a low self-esteem adult. Thus, verbal abuse may be considered as grave and must be given serious attention. Laws are the reflection of the attitude of a particular society. Since the function of law is mainly to maintain societal peace and order, it is through law that we can infer how society regards a particular issue, in this regard, verbal abuse on children. This paper aims to highlight firstly, on verbal abuse as another significant form of child abuse needing to be given serious consideration by the society and secondly, on the parameters of child abuse under the Malaysian Child Act 2001; and finally concludes with whether the provisions under the Malaysian Child Act 2001 are sufficient to protect children from verbal abuse.",

      "title": "The Concept of the Superego: A Reformulation",
      "abstract": "1. The superego is a group of compromise formations, all having to do with morality, which originate, in large part, in the oedipal phase of development. 2. Once formed as a consequence of conflict, the superego functions as a major component of (subsequent) conflicts. 3. Its role in conflict is diverse. It functions now as defense, now as the equivalent of a drive derivative arousing unpleasure, and now as a calamitous unpleasure to be avoided or mitigated. 4. For a young child \"moral\" equals approved by parents, while \"immoral\" equals the reverse. The crucial moral questions at the time of life when the superego is largely formed are, \"What will win or forfeit parental approval?\" and \"What will rouse or dissipate parental wrath?\" 5. From the side of ego functioning, superego formation involves much more than identification with parental superego demands and prohibitions. Any aspect of ego functioning which furthers parental approval and/or avoids disapproval and punishment can and does participate in superego formation. 6. From the side of the drives, both libido and aggression are involved in superego formation. Hence masochism plays a role in normal superego formation and functioning as well as in those pathological cases which Freud called moral masochism. 7. Superego pathology is not to be understood, as it has been generally understood by analysts until now, in terms of defective or incomplete development. Everyone has a fully formed superego. Superego pathology must be understood on the same basis as is the pathology of any compromise formation.",

      "abstract": "Both partner abuse and general crime violate the rights and safety of victims. But are these phenomena the same or are they distinct, demanding their own research and intervention specialties? Are per‐ sons who abuse their partners the same people who commit other criminal behavior? Do partner abuse and general crime share the same correlates? We investigated these questions in a birth cohort of over 800 young adults, by testing whether a personality model known to predict general crime would also predict partner abuse. Personality data were gathered at age 18, and self‐reported partner abuse and general criminal offending were measured at age 21. Results from modeling latent constructs showed that partner abuse and general crime represent different constructs that are moderately related; they are not merely two expressions of the same underlying antisocial propensity. Group comparisons showed many, but not all, partner abusers also engaged in violence against nonintimates. Personality analyses showed that partner abuse and general crime shared a strong propensity from a trait called Negative Emotionality. However, crime was related to weak Constraint (low self‐control), but partner abuse was not. All findings applied to women as well as to men, suggesting that women's partner abuse may be motivated by the same intra‐personal features that motivate men's abuse. The results are consistent with theoretical and applied arguments about the “uniqueness” of partner violence relative to other crime and violence.",

Children of 3, 4, and 5 years of age were told or shown that child story characters held beliefs different from their own or from one another, not only concerning matters of physical fact (\"false beliefs\"), but also concerning morality, social convention, value, and ownership of property. In contrast to the older subjects, most 3-year-olds had difficulty in attributing to others deviant beliefs of all types, except perhaps ownership, sometimes even after having been told repeatedly what the other child believed. In addition, intercorrelations among different belief tasks were positive and substantial. It was suggested that an emerging representational conception of the mind is what enables older preschoolers to understand the possibility of belief differences of all these types.",

If do not receive timely and proper professional social and psychological assistance, in victims, increases the level of trauma that could greatly complicate further their physical, psychological and social recovery.

These are the essential concepts behind the theory of relative deprivation. Because a wide range of studies on racial riots, student and feminist protest movements reveal that the participants in these events are generally not the most deprived or disadvantaged of their respective groups, the relative deprivation explanation appears to be a plausible alternative to an absolute deprivation thesis. The first use of the term 'relative deprivation' dates from the Second World War. Since then, social psychologists, sociologists and political scientists have developed a number of models of relative deprivation in order to explain various personal and collective phenomena. There is an assumed link between experienced relative deprivation and the attitudinal or behavioural consequences at the personal and collective levels.",

      "abstract": "The conflicts of 24 pairs of previously unacquainted 21-month-old children were examined for social hallmarks at several levels of analysis. Each child was observed with the same partner for 15 min on 3 consecutive days. On the fourth day half the dyads were rearranged such that each child now was paired with a new partner; the remaining children returned to meet their usual partners. Conflicts were defined dyadically as 1 child's protesting, resisting, or retaliating against an act by the peer; 217 were recorded across the 4 days, 84% of which were struggles over toys. The disputes possessed a patterned interactive structure and explicit communicative content, and 75% of the object struggles were preceded or followed by socially pertinent events. The extent of conflict neither increased nor decreased over days, nor were there reliable differences between acquainted peers on the fourth day. However, the outcome of 1 conflict affected the next; a child who lost a dispute was more likely than the winner to initiate the next. Moreover, the findings suggested that dyadic as well as dispositional factors influenced conflictual behavior; the children's tendency to initiate disputes on the fourth day could be predicted from their initiations on the first 3 days for both groups, but prediction of their tendency to yield to the peer's demands for objects was only possible for the group who retained the same partners.",

On one hand, such reactions can be classified as emotionally rooted, cognition grounded, and behaviorally linked; while on the other, feedbacks can be based upon the level of self-confidence, conceit, anxiety, depression, attachment style, perceived social support, and sexual orientation. The extent of sensitivity to rejection is accounted for by the quality of personal relationships, which eventually establish the physical and the psychological well being of an individual. Although people are expected to experience negative emotions when faced with denunciation, refusal, or elimination (due to several factors), they react differently. Integrated and socially involved people are more likely to constructively surpass misfortunes, sudden unemployment, the unexpected death of loved ones, and other possible shocks. Similarly, people who lack healthy and affirmative social ties are more inclined to take maladaptive actions when they encounter difficult situations.",

      "title": "The meaning of incontinence: a qualitative study of non‐geriatric urinary incontinence sufferers",
      "abstract": "The meaning of the problem for incontinence sufferers is known to be a very significant influence on coping The present study was based on in‐depth qualitative interviews with 28 young or middle‐aged women who suffered urinary incontinence Analysis, aimed at discovering the meaning of their condition for the sufferers themselves, led to the following conclusions Incontinence is taboo, meaning not only that it is a socially unacceptable topic of conversation (inhibiting the approach of sufferers to health professionals), but also that it is difficult for sufferers themselves to focus on and think about clearly Sufferers can react with apathy, or may perpetually teeter on the edge of taking ameliorative action rational ways of tackling the problem are often not followed The problem is seen as one of personal control incontinence is lack of a grip on bodily propriety Sufferers may feel horribly unique, and also worry that the incontinence is their own fault They fear a guilty association with despised groups It is noteworthy that the maintenance of ‘normality’— allowing the sufferer to claim that there is no problem and that she is not incontinent — may involve a great deal of work Although there are indications of defensive denial in sufferers’ reactions to the problem, an additional interpretation is that they are fighting to subordinate the problem in favour of other priorities Implications for practice of each of these features of the meaning of incontinence are drawn out",

Responses to infertilityIn response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may affect sexual activity.The stress of infertility and its treatment may also cause sexual difficulties for both men and women.Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem.Post-coital tests or repeated need to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, which can adversely affect his erectile or ejaculatory ability.For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begin a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures.Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress.Some people feel that their partner wants them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control.Such stresses conspire to alienate couples from the recreational aspects of sexual expression and focus them, often obsessively, on the procreative aspect of sexual intercourse.",

      "abstract": "Almost 4% of the UK population have some form of physical, sensory, or intellectual impairment—almost 2.5 million people. Many of these disabling conditions can produce sexual problems of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain in men and women. Sexual difficulties may arise from direct trauma to the genital area (due to either accident or disease), damage to the nervous system (such as spinal cord injury), or as an indirect consequence of a non-sexual illness (cancer of any organ may not directly affect sexual abilities but can cause fatigue and reduce the desire or ability to engage in sexual activity). The two main points for consideration are how disabling conditions affect sexual function and behaviour and which sexual difficulties most commonly arise. Women who undergo radical mastectomy or a disfiguring trauma often report concerns about their femininity and self image such as feelings of lowered self worth or the fear that men will find them less attractive. Similarly, young men with erectile dysfunction often avoid meeting potential partners because of their embarrassment over their inability to perform. \"Sexuality\" describes how people express their view of what is sexual. That awareness is the result of all the physical, emotional, intellectual, and social factors that have influenced their development up to that point in their life. Defining sexuality as wider than just physical functionis particularly important for people with disabilities. A person who is not able to use part of his or her body still has an equal right to full sexual expression. ### Key questions in cases of disability Present condition Effect of condition on sexuality",

      "abstract": "Homosexually active men and women are no more immune than anyone else from various types of sexual dysfunction and underlying psychopathology. Intimacy fears and conflicts, ignorance, alcohol and drug dependence and relationship issues exemplify the type of issues influencing dysfunction regardless of sexual orientation, although membership of a stigmatized minority sexuality may exacerbate causes of sexual dysfunction. The effects of discordant lifestyle and identity, homosexual identity formation, dysphoria and internalized homophobia on sexual functioning are three examples of these factors of specific relevance to being homosexual in this culture. The effects of AIDS, difficulties arising from the mechanics of safer sex and the psychosexual effects of oppression on healthy sexual functioning all indicate how factors important to (but not caused by) minority sexuality status may influence sexuality functioning. The importance of neither perceiving homosexuality solely in terms of pathology on the one hand, nor refusing to recognize unhealthy sexual functioning on the other, is emphasized throughout. Models of sexuality must be inclusive, positive and communicated to the client if future sexual dysfunction is to be limited. Finally, the role of the therapist in community development, as well as individual intervention, is addressed. Primary health care interventions are required not only to address the specific issues affecting homosexual men and women, but also to promote a more positive approach to sexuality for all.",

      "title": "Public Health and the Second 50 Years of Life",
      "abstract": "Aging is the maturation and senescence of biological systems. With each additional decade of life, adults will see a number of changes, for example, a slowing in reaction time, psychomotor speed, and verbal memory; declines in strength and walking speed; a decreased rate of urine flow; loss of skeletal muscle; and, of course, greater mortality. They will also see declines in addictive behaviors and crime; a reduction in severe psychiatric disorders; stability in psychological well-being; continuing increases in vocabulary; greater selectivity in friendship and increased contact with close family; less need for novel stimuli; and increases in wealth, leisure time, and altruistic behaviors, among many other changes. The popular understanding of aging mostly stresses negative changes that result in disability, but a more complete understanding should stress both kinds of change, for both are relevant to a public health perspective on aging.\r\n\r\nThese changes may be more prevalent in older people because they are, in fact, true expressions of senescence. Or they may be more prevalent simply because of the greater length of time older people have lived, and hence the greater opportunity they have had to experience the risks or exposures that produce these effects. This is a key distinction. More than likely, some combination of true senescence and greater exposure to risk factors is likely to be responsible for the changes we consider “aging.” For example, the highest audible pitch people can hear declines with age, suggesting that this change is a senescent feature of the auditory system. But it is also likely that long years of occupational exposure to noise, untreated ear infections during childhood, neurological conditions, and an accumulation of minor injuries might contribute to loss of hearing in old age. What happens in the first half of life must surely matter to health in the second half.",

      "abstract": "Slippery slope arguments appear regularly whenever morally contested social change is proposed. Such arguments assume that all or some consequences which could possibly flow from permitting a particular practice are morally unacceptable. Typically, “slippery slope” arguments claim that endorsing some premise, doing some action or adopting some policy will lead to some definite outcome that is generally judged to be wrong or bad. The “slope” is “slippery” because there are claimed to be no plausible halting points between the initial commitment to a premise, action, or policy and the resultant bad outcome. The desire to avoid such projected future consequences provides adequate reasons for not taking the first step. Thus the legalization of abortion in limited circumstances is asserted to lead down the slippery slope towards abortion on demand and even infanticide; and the legalization of assisted suicide to lead inexorably to the acceptance of voluntary euthanasia and subsequently to the sanctioning of the practice of nonvoluntary euthanasia – even involuntary euthanasia of “undesirable” individuals.",

      "abstract": "There is no word here of 'criminals' in the legal sense. According to our laws an insane person is incapable of committing crime. But some of the insane are dangerous to society and require restraint and treatment. many cases it is difficult to distinguish insane from criminal impulses and actions. Nervous and mental disturbances unquestionably make anti-social deeds more frequent. Therefore brief notice must here be given to this aspect of our problem. In the United States the conviction is gathering momentum in everwidening circles that society is constantly in danger from certain classes of the insane, as well as from the feelle-minded and epileptic, and that measures must be taken for protection. Now that the idea of social revenge is definitely abandoned by all enlightened leaders, and the standpoint of social protection is accepted, we are in much better position to deal with the problem without passion or prejudice. It is impossible in many cases to judge whether a person is insane or not; impossible to measure the degree of responsibility or of desert, and the penalty which will satisfy abstract justice. We ought by this time to be able to free ourselves from the metaphysical confusion which disturbs the traditional penal codes built on the unverifiable assumption that a judge, a jury, or a legislature can measure the pains due to a specific act. What we can discover, with the aid of modern science, is the fact that a given person is dangerous to the life, persons or property of the community, and we can define a suitable method or education, medical treatment and seclusion which will, in one way or another, protect society. All this can be done legally, with judicial safeguards of liberty, and in a way which will be best even for the person placed under treatment. Many a dangerous man has been set at liberty by courts and juries because they feared to condemn an insane person; and so individuals have been placed in jeopardy, and the trait of insanity has been transmitted to children through the vicious system based upon false assumptions.",

Sexual addiction was defined similarly to how the DSM-5 has defined substance use disorders. Following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, as well as how Carnes et al. defined sexual addiction, it sometimes appears as though sexual offenders are sex addicts and are therefore not responsible for their sexually abusive behaviour. Sex offenders may have a sexual addiction in addition to being a sexual offender; however the sexual addiction has nothing to do with sexual offending. No different than a sex offender having a substance use disorder- the drugs or alcohol used never cause the offender to rape, rape is a choice the offender makes whether sober or intoxicated. Sexual addiction involves having intense thoughts involving sexual activities and may include engaging in numerous promiscuous sexual encounters and frequent masturbation. However, those sexual encounters are not about forced sex, just about sex. Sexual offenders rape and molest because of thoughts involving the use of physical or psychological use of force to obtain sex and/or because of sexual thoughts involving children or adolescents.",

Nevertheless, other liberal values are derived from what will be termed here the 'ethics of self-acceptance'. The latter is more disguised in liberalism and the DRM, as rather than emphasising the capacity to make autonomous decisions, self-acceptance focuses on the positive acceptance of individual limitations, but again to enhance well-being. The further argument is that while the ethics of agency and self-acceptance often logically cohere and overlap, through promoting the values of self-respect and relational autonomy, dilemmas arise from our asymmetrical, or uneven, dispositions towards time, and present and future lives and experiences. For example, positively accepting individual limitations allows for a present-oriented immersion in 'the moment', but which often requires some suspension of future-oriented goals and aspirations. Understanding some of the implications of this asymmetry, and the dilemmas arising from it, provide important insights concerning approaches to physical and intellectual impairments and the subsequent debates within the DRM, social policy and welfare practice.",

      "title": "Childhood Sexual Abuse: What Rehabilitation Counselors Need to Know",
      "abstract": "Individuals with disabilities are at greater risk of sexual abuse. This includes both people who have congenital disabilities and those with acquired disabilities. Contrary to popular belief that young people with disabilities are protected from abuse and exploitation, there is evidence that they are, in fact, at increased risk for sexual abuse and maltreatment. In a British Columbia (Canada) survey of 16,000 high school students, 38% of those students with disabilities reported having been sexually abused or assaulted, compared with 17% of those without disabilities (Murphy, 1995). The fact that youth who have disabilities are at a higher risk for sexual abuse indicates that this area needs exploration by the rehabilitation counseling profession. Definition of Sexual Abuse Sexual abuse is defined as being forced, threatened, or deceived into sexual activities ranging from looking or touching to intercourse or rape. Child abuse has been defined in the literature to include any act of commission or omission that endangers or impairs a child's physical or emotional health and development. It may be evident by an injury or series of injuries appearing to be non-accidental in nature and which cannot reasonably be explained. The most frequent forms of child abuse are physical abuse, emotional abuse or deprivation, and sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of children involves someone too young to give informed consent but who has been involved in a sexual act. Exploitation of an individual who lacks adequate information to recognize such a situation or who is unable to understand or communicate (i.e., the child with a mental or physical disability) is also considered sexual abuse. This kind of abuse is a violation of the whole person and is not restricted to only a sexual act. It results in indignation and an overwhelming sense of violation and invasion that can affect the victim in physical, psychological, and social ways. Frequently, the aftermath of the assault or abuse is more severe than the actual event. This is particularly true of people with disabilities who cannot (or do not) access support systems and services that may otherwise be available. There is sexual abuse without touch, as when someone exposes his or her genitals or forces or tricks an individual to exposing his or her own genitals. Another type of sexual abuse without touch involves obscene telephone calls, as when an individual calls and talks about sex (e.g., ways they would like to touch a person's body or be touched). Primary affects of these crimes may be short-term but in many cases there is irreparable psychological harm done to the victim that can continue into adulthood. The nature of the sexual abuse also makes it difficult to observe and therefore more threatening to report. Professionals who work with people with disabilities need to be able to recognize signs and symptoms of sexual abuse. These symptoms include behaviors, attitudes, psychosocial aspects, and physical manifestations. Scope of the Problem It is difficult to estimate rates of sexual abuse among children with disabilities. One reason is that states do not collect data about abused children in the same way. A second reason is that researchers identify disability among maltreated children in different ways. Additionally, many cases of sexual abuse go unreported because these children do not inform anyone, especially when other family members are involved; parents often fear repercussions if the authorities become involved. Nonetheless, available research has found that children with disabilities are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than children without disabilities. A national study (Crosse, Kaye, & Ratnofsky, 2001) found that children with disabilities were 1.7 times more likely to be abused than children without disabilities. It is estimated that between 9% and 15% of all children in the United States have a disability; approximately 175,000 to 300,000 children with disabilities in this country are maltreated each year. …",

      "abstract": "Female high school students' experiences and perceptions of gender roles and gender stereotypes is largely missing from research on sexual health and dating violence.The aim of this study was to examine how adolescent females perceive of and experience gender roles and gender inequity in dating relationships.A secondary data analysis of seventy in-depth interviews from a larger study on adolescent females' perceptions of healthy and unhealthy dating relationships was conducted.The majority of participants were 16 or 17-year-old, almost 80% self-identified as Caucasian or African American, and the majority were 11th or 12th graders.Five themes emerged: 1) Biology, socialization or what? with subthemes 1a) Biology and 1b) Socialization; 2) Experiences and perceptions of power and control in relationships; 3) The conundrum of stereotypes: challenges, confrontations, confusions; 4) The importance and motivation of sex; 5) Communication, caring, commitment, with subthemes, 5a) Males not wanting committed relationships, females wanting them, 5b) Who cares?Males do not care and females care deeply, and 5c) Role reversals.Public health programs can be strengthened by inclusion of the voices of adolescent females.Programs promoting healthy adolescent relationships should engage adolescent males and females, utilize role models, and focus on collective action.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood that begins around the onset of puberty and ends with relative independence from the parent. This developmental period is one when an individual is probably stronger, of higher reasoning capacity, and more resistant to disease than ever before, yet when mortality rates increase by 200%. These untimely deaths are not due to disease but to preventable deaths associated with adolescents putting themselves in harm's way (e.g., accidental fatalities). We present evidence that these alarming health statistics are in part due to diminished self-control--the ability to inhibit inappropriate desires, emotions, and actions in favor of appropriate ones. Findings of adolescent-specific changes in self-control and underlying brain circuitry are considered in terms of how evolutionarily based biological constraints and experiences shape the brain to adapt to the unique intellectual, physical, sexual, and social challenges of adolescence.",

      "title": "Who makes false allegations and why? The nature, motives, and mental health status of those who wrongly allege sexual assault",
      "abstract": "Allegations of sexual assault, both true and false, are common and cause considerable harm. False allegations may be deliberate or inadvertent or partially true with elements distorted or embellished. Deliberate fabrications are usually motived by personal gains such as material profit, revenge, provide an alibi, or to win sympathy. Sometimes, those making false allegations may have underlying mental health issues. Other cases of wrongful allegations arise when accusers sincerely but falsely believe they have been sexually assaulted, either naming the wrong person or recounting an event that did not occur. Memories may not be accurate, and new post-event information can become incorporated to create false memories. When investigators believe that abuse has occurred, confirmatory bias may mean that only evidence supporting the allegation is sought, and evidence contradicting the claim is ignored or misinterpreted. Examples include custody disputes and widespread allegations of ritual abuse in day-care centres in the 1990s. The premise that false allegations rarely happen, and that all sexual offence complainants must be believed, has led to prosecution policy assuming presumptive guilt of the defendant. Convictions based solely on believing the complainant not the defendant in the absence of any corroborative evidence could be considered counter to the premise of guilty beyond reasonable doubt. This chapter explores some of the factors that may influence outcome.",

The complexity of the sexual life of some patients is not primarily caused by the \"acting-out\" generated by their instinctive, pregenital fixations or polymorphous and/or perverse fixations, but by an attempt of compensation of the underlying mental void. Patients with mental void have a tendency to pass from the signal of anxiety to dread. This is an indication of their ego fragility, particularly the narcissistic fragility of the organizing identifications of their psychic apparatus. Very often, sexual experiences carried out in order to shape an exaggerated masculine identity, followed by polymorphous sexual behaviour of different kinds, are attempts at evolution, an evolution that has probably been somehow interrupted during their lives.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Integrity, honesty, and moral conduct are essential elements in a good leader. Most people would agree with that statement. Disagreement comes when these standards are applied equally to personal and professional lives. The general thinking of society today maintains that if it doesn't hurt anyone else, I can do whatever I wish. What I do in my private life is my business. My employer has no right to evaluate or punish me for my private conduct as long as my job performance is not degraded. This philosophy is applied -- especially in the civilian sector -- to using drugs, drinking alcohol, having sex, lying, and cheating. Increasingly, the courts are agreeing with this position. In the military, we take a different view. Drugs are not tolerated. Alcohol abuse can ruin a career. Sexual involvement with other people in the workplace is disciplined -- and in many cases prohibited. Dishonesty is severely punished. Since becoming a general officer, I have heard senior leaders say at various times to closed-door gatherings of general officers, you are sleeping around with someone other than your spouse, stop it! You will be discovered. If you insist on such conduct, have the integrity to resign and take off your uniform. These are strong words, and the implication is clear: for senior leaders, private and public lines are almost erased. We do not have the freedom to conduct ourselves any way we desire in private. Unfortunately, we can no longer assume that ethics and integrity are givens for people who solemnly take their oath of office as military personnel. Thus, we must institute controls and accountability. In so doing, we are saying that private and professional ethics must be the same. I am firmly convinced that integrity and ethics must be built from within, reserving the law and fear as last choices only. The real question is, How do we do this? In this article, I submit a number of suggestions for consideration.",

      "title": "Individualizing Criminal Law’s Justice Judgments: Shortcomings in the Doctrines of Culpability, Mitigation, and Excuse",
      "abstract": "In judging an offender’s culpability, mitigation, or excuse, there seems to be general agreement that it is appropriate for the criminal law to take into account such things as the offender’s youthfulness or her significantly low IQ. There is even support for taking account of their distorted perceptions and reasoning induced by traumatic experiences, as in battered spouse syndrome. On the other hand, there seems to be equally strong opposition to taking account of things such as racism or homophobia that played a role in bringing about the offense. In between these two clear points, however, exists a large collection of individual offender characteristics and circumstances for which there is lack of clarity as to whether the criminal law should take them into account. Should our assessment of an offender’s criminal liability be adjusted for their cultural background? Their religious beliefs? Their past life experiences? The pedophilic tendencies they have always had but usually suppressed?\r\n\r\nThe question of how much to individualize the criminal liability judgment is not peripheral or unusual but rather common in a wide range of formal criminal law doctrines including, for example, the culpability requirements of recklessness and negligence, the mitigation of provocation and its more modern form of extreme emotional disturbance, and the excuse defenses of mistake as to a justification, duress, and involuntary intoxication. indeed, it turns out that the problem of individualizing factors is present, if often obscured, in all criminal law doctrines of culpability, mitigation, and excuse.\r\n\r\nThe Article reviews the appeal of criminal law adhering to a purely objective standard, where the problem of the individualizing factors is sought to be avoided altogether. But the resulting stream of injustices has forced most jurisdictions to adopt a partially individualized standard in some cases involving some doctrines. But this leaves the jurisdiction’s criminal law in an awkward and unstable state. Without a guiding principle for determining which individualizing factors are to be taken into account under what circumstances, the law is inevitably unprincipled and internally inconsistent. And without guidance, different decision-makers inevitably come to different conclusions in similar cases.\r\n\r\nThe Article proposes a solution to the individualizing factors puzzle and a statutory codification that would provide guidance in the adjudication of the many cases in which the issue arises.",

The authors present four cases that demonstrate how negligent maltreatment is a more frequent phenomenon than abuse classically understood as the result of violent physical maltreatment. The identification of the causal/noncausal role of negligent behavior in fatal cases must, due to the particular difficulty in defining it, make use of a complete and accurate forensic investigation. However, the universal character of this type of maltreatment should not be overlooked since it could affect not only the age groups that classically, even according to the most recent international forensic considerations, are involved in the phenomenon but any individual, of any age, who for pathological conditions or pathophysiological is in the position of having to depend on another person for his state of health and well-being.",

      "title": "Psychosocial aspects of sexuality in adolescents with visual impairments",
      "abstract": "According to the ecological model, all sexual activity results from experiences gathered during the biologically based process of socialization. Therefore, analysis of the impact that visual impairment has on the psychosexual functioning of adolescents should consider not only the functional aspect but mainly the sociocultural aspect. Specific upbringing and education conditions in childhood and adolescence (e.g.: compulsory schooling in a special center - often in a live-in environment, parental overprotectiveness, lack of or unadapted sexual education curricula, etc.) may hinder learning of typical interpersonal interaction patterns and delay one’s sexual identification process. The limited range of social experiences may result in a low mentalization of the need, and, in consequence, a lack of its stimulation, which manifests itself, for instance, in a lower frequency of autoerotic behaviors among blind adolescent boys as compared to their nondisabled peers. Moreover, a lowered self-esteem and sense of interpersonal attractiveness relating to the lack of acceptance of one’s disability, awareness of being dependent on others, and negative reactions of people around which are based on false beliefs about blind people’s sexuality can also make it difficult to build close relationships and form emotional and sexual bonds. A review of studies on the sexuality of blind and visually impaired adolescents does not allow unambiguous conclusions to be drawn about the course of this group’s development. The data collected are generally descriptive in nature and do not fully reflect the specificity of sexual functioning in the whole population of adolescents with visual impairments as, frequently, the studies were conducted with small samples and did not take into account different types and severity of visual impairment. Also, discrepancies in the findings relating to individual aspects of psychosexual development may be due to differences in instruments used by researchers as well as to the sociocultural nature of the approach to sexuality that is specific to the country where the study was carried out.",

      "abstract": "RESUMEN La creación de un estoma intestinal representa mucho más que un procedimiento quirúrgico funcional; constituye una transformación profunda que involucra la identidad corporal, esfera emocional, sexualidad y vida social del paciente. El impacto emocional puede ser profundo, y muchas veces subestimado por los equipos de salud, afectando la calidad de vida y el proceso de recuperación del paciente. En muchos casos, los pacientes reportan sentimientos de despersonalización y pérdida del atractivo físico, lo cual afecta su autoestima y sus relaciones interpersonales. Los pacientes ostomizados presentan una prevalencia elevada de síntomas ansiosos y depresivos, especialmente cuando el estoma se percibe como permanente o si fue resultado de una cirugía de urgencia. El trastorno de adaptación es también común, caracterizado por dificultades emocionales persistentes para asumir los cambios en el estilo de vida, alimentación, sexualidad e higiene. Las preocupaciones sobre el atractivo físico, el miedo a fugas o el rechazo por parte de la pareja pueden conducir a una disminución del deseo sexual o incluso a evitar las relaciones íntimas. Así mismo, muchos pacientes reducen sus actividades sociales por miedo al estigma o a situaciones embarazosas en público. El estoma intestinal exige una respuesta clínica que trascienda lo técnico y abrace la dimensión humana del proceso, es fundamental trabajar en la reconstrucción de la identidad psicológica y corporal del paciente. Solo mediante un enfoque biopsicosocial, centrado en la persona, será posible favorecer una adaptación saludable, restaurar el bienestar subjetivo y promover una vida digna y plena más allá de la ostomía.

Schizoids are more frequently single, childless and live alone, while hysterics are married, remarried or divorced, have one child and live with their partner and the child. With nearly the same education and intelligence, schizoid patients are more often workers/skilled workers, pupils/apprentices/students or have no profession; hysterically structured individuals, being predominantly women, are more frequently housewives. Nearly half of the most frequent triggering events are equally distributed in both structure groups; these are particularly events signalling a change during development, which, in degree of severity, can just as well be minor threshold situations as serious reverses. With an earlier age of onset, schizoids decompensate significantly more often in \"developmental stages\", whereas hysterical patients are more likely to do so in connection with events of \"love-sexuality\" and those which provoke hysterical anxieties. Of the 15 most frequent events, only 6 each occur in either the schizoids (starting school, puberty, moving away from home, entering into a heterosexual relationship in terms of a casual encounter, beginning an apprenticeship or studies, failure in a test) or the hysterically structured individuals (vacation, marriage, pregnancy/delivery, marital disharmony, extra-marital relationship and severe illness of the patient).",

Likewise, the importance of normal narcissistic functioning for individual mental health and capacity to live an optimal life has mostly been taken for granted. Healthy narcissistic functions, such as a sense of the right to one’s own life, striving for the best in life, appreciation of health and beauty, and ability to compete as well as to protect and defend oneself, are usually first attended to when they are absent or noticed as extreme. Nevertheless, healthy narcissism plays a crucial role in the human capacity to manage challenges, successes, and changes; to overcome defeats, illnesses, trauma, and losses; to love and be productive and creative; and to experience happiness, satisfaction, and acceptance of the course of one’s life.",

We belong to groups and to society with all their norms, to which we are more or less obedient. Subsystems and their various norms can contradict each other or they can be congruent. It seems obvious that adolescents today live under a system that is infinitely more complex than adolescents of a few centuries ago. To simplify, we can say that earlier there were clear rites de passage, indicating when a child changed into an adult. For example, in some Christian societies the confirmation ceremony acted as such a rite of passage. Nowadays, at least in many Western societies, there is no such rite. The adolescent may be counted as a child until 20 years of age when it comes to buying liquor, but as an adult at 12 years of age when traveling by bus or train. Many are not considered adults until they have a college or university education or have married and had children.",

      "title": "Reforming Juvenile Justice: A Developmental Approach",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a distinct, yet transient, period of development between childhood and adulthood characterized by increased experimentation and risk-taking, a tendency to discount long-term consequences, and heightened sensitivity to peers and other social influences. A key function of adolescence is developing an integrated sense of self, including individualization, separation from parents, and personal identity. Experimentation and novelty-seeking behavior, such as alcohol and drug use, unsafe sex, and reckless driving, are thought to serve a number of adaptive functions despite their risks. Research indicates that for most youth, the period of risky experimentation does not extend beyond adolescence, ceasing as identity becomes settled with maturity. Much adolescent involvement in criminal activity is part of the normal developmental process of identity formation and most adolescents will mature out of these tendencies. Evidence of significant changes in brain structure and function during adolescence strongly suggests that these cognitive tendencies characteristic of adolescents are associated with biological immaturity of the brain and with an imbalance among developing brain systems. This imbalance model implies dual systems: one involved in cognitive and behavioral control and one involved in socio-emotional processes. Accordingly adolescents lack mature capacity for self-regulations because the brain system that influences pleasure-seeking and emotional reactivity develops more rapidly than the brain system that supports self-control. This knowledge of adolescent development has underscored important differences between adults and adolescents with direct bearing on the design and operation of the justice system, raising doubts about the core assumptions driving the criminalization of juvenile justice policy in the late decades of the 20th century. It was in this context that the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) asked the National Research Council to convene a committee to conduct a study of juvenile justice reform. The goal of Reforming Juvenile Justice: A Developmental Approach was to review recent advances in behavioral and neuroscience research and draw out the implications of this knowledge for juvenile justice reform, to assess the new generation of reform activities occurring in the United States, and to assess the performance of OJJDP in carrying out its statutory mission as well as its potential role in supporting scientifically based reform efforts.",

The concept of happiness is close to the concept of “life quality” which refers to satisfaction and includes humen, environmental, social and economical aspects. Happiness has different degrees. Optimism is considered as happinness and pesimism is unhapiness. A society happiness is considered when wellbeing is present in most of the individuals. The society has perception factors for happiness, such as trust in people, political trust, number of mental diseases, criminality index, life expectancy, etc. Happiness can be induced such as in “results expectancy” and in “placebo effect”",

There is little disagreement that all individuals living with dementia retain personhood at a basic biological level. ■ Individual personhood: This relates to an individual's characteristics including such things as the past, roles, personality, values, self-worth and spirituality. ■ Sociological personhood: This is defined by the perceptions of society and other people's approach to the person with dementia. As social contacts become aware of cognitive decline, their behaviour towards the individual begins to change. Residents become more isolated and sociological personhood is threatened. Individuals living in nursing homes can become increasingly socially isolated.",

      "abstract": "level can forsee the deviancy disappearing at other ages or in other contexts. Hyperactivity, for example, can be seen as both normal and abnormal depending on whether the child is a pre-schooler or an adolescent. The mother who can appreciate the discontinuous nature of her child's behavior is better equipped to make qualitative changes in her treatment of the child as the child's activities and requirements change with development. The mother who is restricted to more primitive levels of viewing her offspring enmeshes the child at later stages in obsolete social and affective relationships formed during infancy. From the low levels of social cognition found in large segments of our society (Chandler, 1973; Looft, 1972) one might expect a much higher proportion of severe caretaking casualties than appears to be the case. Possibly, the same kinds of self-righting tendencies that Wad dington (1966) postulated for biological development are operative at the psychological level. One of these self-righting tendencies might exist in the transactions between parent and child. The mother has little difficulty viewing the infant from a sensorimotor level of cognition while the infant is in the sensorimotor period. However, as the child progresses through his own development, his caretakers are forced to view him from different perspectives, potentially causing a restructuring of their view of the child. At each new level the child makes interactional demands at higher levels of complexity, frequently surprising parents by this emerging precocity.

To the extent that the scientific and educational es tablishment are limited to a concrete view that perceives developmen tal deviancy as foreordained by poor genes or perinatal complications, there is little in the way of therapy to offer mothers with problems. To the extent that society as a whole can move from a main-effect to a transactional model of development a new context is provided for educating mothers toward understanding the intricate interplay between organismic and environmental factors in the determination of developmental outcomes. To summarize, disorders in development have been retrospectively attributed to a variety of early constitutional or environmental factors. When these predisposing factors have been studied prospectively little support is given to their causal role or their predictive value for later deviancy. Evidence for qualitative continuities and stabilities in development appear to be artifacts of an incomplete analysis of the child in its environment. When the two are examined in combination, complex reciprocal transactions are found which reduce or amplify ear ly problems in behavior. Developmental outcomes must be interpreted as the products of a child's characteristics, his material environment and the cognitive levels and values of his social milieu. Where the social environment fosters rigidity, stereotyping, and concreteness in thought and behavior, early deviancies can become resistant to the normal restruc turing implicit in development. Where flexibility, openness, and adap tability are fundamental characteristics of the environment, early problems are dissipated as the child advances in his construction and organization of both his cognitive and social world.",

An exploratory study of twenty child abusive families found that each family was involved in at least one other violent activity, as well as (with only one exception) more than one type of child abuse. The violence was directed by adults and children towards self, adults, children, and/or the community. It is suggested that failure to take all violence into account may have hindered theory development. It is also proposed that there may be serious implications for intervention in child abuse in that the child protection worker may underestimate the danger to, and other effects on, the child.",

Functional outcomes depend on a complex interplay of physiological, developmental and environmental factors. We start with the premise that hearing loss by itself will often have an impact on cognitive organization but not necessarily or consistently on intellectual, neuropsychological, emotional, social or behavioral functioning. Disruption of these functions depends heavily on other factors that may be associated with etiology of the hearing loss or the interaction between individuals and their environment, including communication, family, educational, emotional and sociolinguistic environments. At the same time, effects related to a hearing loss can have significant negative impact in each of these areas, particularly without comprehensive and appropriate supports.",

The chapter also focuses on the aspects of sexual life directly linked to health; however, one should never forget that adolescents who are not sexually active are still sexual beings, and sexual experience and intercourse is just one aspect or dimension of sexuality among those teenagers who are sexually active. The development and acknowledgement of sexual orientation plays an important role in the formation of adult identity. Adolescents suffering from chronic diseases and/or disability often face difficulties in integrating a defective body within their sexual development.",

Unlike other exceptionalities, the prognosis for giftedness is, of course, considerably more positive. Like the others, however, this kind of differentness makes demands on family and community resources and carries risks of psychosocial stress, social isolation, and nonfulfillment of potential. Given society's other pressing needs, those of this group often are brushed aside, even resented; both the life quality of the children and their families and the contribution the children might make in years to come, therefore, can be eroded. All children deserve to love school and to have the opportunity to make the best of their possibilities. Informed and sympathetic pediatricians who are sensitive to the issues involved can play critical roles in promoting healthy development. Definitions and Prevalence Reasoning from the apparent symmetry of the normal curve, professionals sometimes tend to regard giftedness as the mirror image of mental retardation, but this is not a useful model. There is much greater diversity among the highly capable than among the less capable. Indeed, advanced ability is neither restrictive nor defining; gifted children (and their families) are probably more diverse than any other group in our society.",

      "abstract": "A theory of pseudomaturity or precocious development has been suggested to explain how mis-timing of adult transition events (occurring too early) can generate difficulties later in life. In a community sample, the age at which 30 adult activities (including various types of drug involvement) were begun were examined for an underlying factor structure, sex differences, and general and specific correlates with various aspects of adult functioning. Five factors were identified, confirmed, and moderately correlated including age of; drug initiation, financial autonomy, independent living, intimacy involvement, and deviant activities. Age at puberty did not load on any factor and was only significantly related to age of intimacy Involvement. Men were involved in drug use, financial autonomy, and deviant activities earlier than women, whereas women began puberty and intimacy at younger ages than the men. Pseudomaturity as reflected in a general construct and specific scales was significantly associated with numerous aspects of later adult role functioning, including drug abuse, socioeconomic status, intimacy involvement, emotional distress, divorces, criminal activities, and job instability. Although certain pseudomature behaviors consistently had adverse later consequences (early drug initiation to later drug abuse), others had differential impact on adult role functioning based on whether the transition event occurred in isolation (financial autonomy alone had beneficial long-term effects) or whether it was associated with a general lifestyle of pseudomaturity (with overall negative consequences).",

      "title": "On Liberty for the Old",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Elderly adults often pose, or are perceived to pose, a risk to themselves or others. Others often also have the will, and sometimes the ability, to intervene in their lives: to take them from their homes, force medical treatment on them, and prevent them from spending their money as they see fit. Thus the question “To what extent, and for what purposes, can others interfere with the liberty of the individual?” takes on particular relevance for elderly adults. This is the question John Stuart Mill addressed in his essay On Liberty , and our aim is to adapt his theory of liberty to guide those who must make decisions about the old. We argue that individuals can be interfered with in their own interest and in the interest of others. It is apt to interfere in their own interest if and only if they are putting themselves at significant risk, are encumbered, i.e. are incompetent or subject to some other judgement-distorting condition, and interference will be: (a) effective, (b) not generative of evils greater than those it prevents, (c) the mildest possible to curb the evil, (d) not discriminatory, and (e), unless the interference has utility approaching absolute necessity, thought justified. It is apt to interfere in the interest of others if and only if they are putting others at significant risk and the same five conditions are satisfied. As we hope our adaptation of Mill's theory of liberty will have practical effect, we illustrate it with examples, relate it to the law in British Columbia, and state it in the form of a decision-tree.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The development of autocratic leaders in history reveals that many share severe character disorders that are consistently similar across borders and cultures. Diplomats and humanitarians negotiating for access to populations in-need and security of their programs, especially in health, must understand the limitations placed on the traditional negotiation process. These shared character traits stem from a cognitive and emotional developmental arrest in both childhood and adolescence resulting in fixed, life-long, concrete thinking patterns. They fail to attain the last stage of mental and emotional development, that of abstract thinking, which is necessary for critical reasoning that allows one to consider the broader significance of ideas and information rather than depend on concrete details and impulses alone. These autocratic leaders have limited capacity for empathy, love, guilt, or anxiety that become developmentally permanent and guide everyday decision making. Character or personality traits that perpetuate the lives of autocratic leaders are further distinguished by sociopathic and narcissistic behaviors that self-serve to cover their constant fear of insecurity and the insatiable need for power. Human rights, humanitarian care, and population-based health security are examples of what has consistently been sacrificed under autocratic rule. Today, with the worst global loss of democratic leadership ever seen since WWII, leaders with these character traits now rule in major countries of the world. While history teaches us of battles and conflicts that result from such flawed leadership, it lacks explanations of why autocratic behaviors consistently emerge and dominate many societies. Building multidisciplinary capacity and capability in societies among democracies to limit or cease such authoritarian dominance first begins with a developmental understanding of why autocrats exist and persist in externalizing their pathological behaviors on unsuspecting and vulnerable populations, and the limitations they place on negotiations. “…once in power, a leader with an Antisocial Personality Disorder thrives on continuing conflict and never seeks peace.” Daedalus Trust, London, 2016 Burkle FM Jr. Character disorders among autocratic world leaders and the impact on health security, human rights, and humanitarian care .

      "title": "[Contraception in adolescence: knowing is not enough].",
      "abstract": "Sexuality is the source of the biological, psychic, and social changes of adolescence. Contraception, by modifying some aspects of sexuality, can change the usual course of adolescence. Sexuality is a new experience for adolescents and is submerged in the same confusion and uncertainty as other areas of their lives. The experience of health personnel in contraception over the years has been gained in prescription for adults, who unlike adolescents are members of stable couples who have found their places in society. Women seeking contraception have usually experienced pregnancy and verified their fecundity, thereby consolidating their identities, unlike the adolescent who is still unsure of her femininity. Contraception for adolescents, by blocking 2 stages in the life of a woman (proving fecundity and experiencing maternity) is an obstacle to the total achievement of adulthood. The connection between sex and pregnancy is recognized by a 13-year-old in a theoretical way, but is not always integrated as a practical reality. Many adults have difficulty accepting the contraception requests of adolescents because they do not feel it is morally right for adolescents to have direct sexual experiences rather than daydreams. The reality of adolescent sexual lives is quite different from what most adults adults imagine it to be. Mental integration of contraception for an adolescent requires acceptance of the link between sex and pregnancy and a mental representation of oneself and one's behavior in which sexuality is considered a possibility. Many adolescents believe that they are too young to become pregnant, or are unable to make the link between sex today and pregnancy in the future, or do not perceive a possible pregnancy in negative terms. After they perceive the need for contraception and develop a desire to meet the need, adolescents must gain knowledge of the different methods available. Choice of a method will be influenced by the degree of efficacy of the method, its cost, facility of use, the frequency of intercourse, secondary effects, social or religious prohibitions, desire to keep contraceptive use secret, and the possibility of involving the partner. Failure to use the chosen means may be caused by such external factors as absence of a nearby family planning center or lack of money, or by internal factors. THe presence of an adult at the contraception consultation may be perceived by the adolescent as a means of control. The consultation may signify to the adolescent a demand for recognition of the reality of his affective and sexual life, a rite of passage, a means of transgressing parental prohibitions, and an indication of acceptance of the dissociation of sexuality from fertility. The presence of the girl's mother can complicate the consultation. Very often the health care professional confuses the role of parent with the medical role, feeling a moral responsibility beyond helping the adolescent avoid pregnancy or abortion. The best course is to be available to listen to the adolescent without prejudice in order to permit the establishment of room for reflection and maturation.",

      "abstract": "The politics of recognition begins from the basic forms of recognition: Love, Law, and Solidarity. From the above mentioned forms of recognition, following A. Honneth, are posed the personal problems confronted by individuals struggling for their own identity: The contempt derived from violation, destitution/ dispossession, and dishonor. Violation refers to the outrage or utter disregard to a person’s body and, therefore, corresponds to a denial of love. Violation implies physical violence of any sort to the body or the psyche, causing an offense, a negative feeling to whom suffers such abuse, which leads on many occasions towards death. Dispossession means to jeopardize a person’s right to own property, of any sort, and therefore, corresponds to a denial to the recognition that derives from Law. Finally, dishonor, the denial to the recognition of solidarity, infringing social recognition, as well as a person’s reputation as regarded by others, implying therefore, an enormous scorn since it is encompassed within a social conglomerate.",

The behavior is one aspect of a person's emotional development that is evolved enough to find a partner but not evolved enough to relate in relationship. Infidelity is defined as taking sexual energy—of any variety that will compromise integrity—outside of a committed relationship, and pretending it will not affect the person, their partner, or their relationship, as long as it remains hidden in both partners. Avoidance behavior and ambivalence are viewed as unacknowledged longing for connection in both partners. Moving from stagnation toward maturity (separation, individuation, and differentiation) and integrity is the treatment focus.",

He can seek paid employment under the protection of law in most states ahead of the age that he is allowed to consider leaving school. He is allowed to drive an automobile at a considerably earlier age than he is allowed to vote. He cannot marry in most states until years past his age of biosexual readiness for reproduction. Yet he dates earlier and breaks from family domination earlier than continental adolescents. By age 181/2, the healthier adolescents are expected to do military duty. By age 17, one-half of them have discontinued schooling. An adolescent is no longer under the protection of the juvenile legal code when he reaches the age range 16 to 21. Biologically it may be possible to describe the American adolescent. However, psychologically there is as great variation in adolescent personality as there is diversity in our melting-pot culture.",

      "abstract": "Although the association between delinquent friends and delinquent behavior is well established, the mechanism by which delinquency is socially transmitted remains unclear. Sutherlands theory of differential association holds that delinquency is a consequence of attitudes favorable to the violation of the law, attitudes that are acquired through intimate social interaction with peers. An analysis of data from the National Youth Survey indicates that peer attitudes do affect delinquency. But the effect of peers'attitudes is small in comparison to that of peers behavior, and the effect of peers'behavior remains strong even when peers, attitudes and the adolescent's own attitude are controlled. Moreover, when the behavior and attitudes of peers are inconsistent, the behavior of peers appears to outweigh or override the attitudes of peers. These findings suggest that delinquency is not primarily a consequence of attitudes acquired from peers. Rather, it more likely stems from other social learning mechanisms, such as imitation or vicarious reinforcement, or from group pressures to conform.",

      "abstract": "People in violent neighbourhoods attribute violence in public spaces to, especially, poverty and unemployment, but agree that social disintegration, disrespect, drinking and drugs and the weaknesses of the criminal justice system also contribute substantially. However, data from a panel of young men in Cape Town provide little support for the hypothesis that unemployment and poverty are direct causes of violence against strangers. Growing up in a home where someone drank heavily or took drugs is, however, a strong predictor of violence against strangers in early adulthood. A history of drinking (or taking drugs) correlates with perpetration of violence, and might also serve as a mechanism through which conditions during childhood have indirect effects. Living in a bad neighbourhood and immediate poverty are associated with violence against strangers, but being unemployed is not. Overall, heavy drinking – whether by adults in the childhood home or by young men themselves – seems to be a more important predictor of violence than economic circumstances in childhood or the recent past. Heavy drinking seems to play an important part in explaining why some young men have been more violent than others in circumstances that seem to have been generally conducive to rising violence, for reasons that remain unclear. It seems likely that few young people in South Africa in the early 2000s come from backgrounds that strongly predispose them against the use of violence.",

Players’ types are not directly observed, but may be imperfectly inferred from observed behavior. We focus on a class of equilibria that satisfy zero tolerance and fresh start. We find that the punishment for defecting and the reward for cooperating are driven by the formation and the dissolution of long-term, high-paying relationships: an individual who defects, aborts a long-term relationship that he is in, or that he might have entered into, is thrown into short-term interactions with individuals who are likely to defect and, consequently, receives low payoffs. On the flip side, an individual who cooperates, enters into or prolongs a long-term interaction with a partner who cooperates and, consequently, receives high payoffs.",

      "abstract": "Future offenders have more ratings than controls on variables indicating psychopathology. The characteristics which most consistently and significantly discriminate between preoffenders and controls, and which also turned out to be the best predictors of future criminality, are those which previously have been observed in subjects with serious mental disorders. The results indicate that the high degree of psychopathology in subsequent offenders is associated with distortion of body image and with poor reality orientation, i.e. that the most prominent characteristics of future offenders are related to a weakness of the ego. Future offenders seem to have a sufficiently developed ego to handle common tasks. However, their ego fails when they are confronted with unfamiliar and frustrating situations. The inability of subsequent offenders to complete a task properly, with failure on difficult and provocative tasks, shows that they have not developed adequate defence mechanisms and that they have a low tolerance for frustration. They are emotionally immature, instable and impulsive. In short, they are dominated by id impulses. There is no indication of gender confusion (homosexuality) in subsequent offenders. However, there are marked differences between the drawings by cases and by controls regarding characteristics related to sexuality. These findings are interpreted as an exaggeration of masculinity and an abnormal preoccupation with sexuality combined with anxiety for the opposite sex. It is possible that severe criminality, contrary to milder forms of lawbreaking, is associated with elevated self-esteem and extroversion. There are indications that ultimate offenders experience human beings (others or themselves) as deviant, monstrous and inhuman, features which indicate that distorted self-concept and distorted self-perception are characteristics of preoffenders. The findings regarding aggression are inconsistent, just as they were in prior projects. The Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) and Colour Slide Test (CST) findings indicate that preoffenders are more aggressive and destructive than controls, whereas the Hand Test (HT) shows neither more aggression nor more acting-out tendencies in future offenders than in controls. The literature offers conflicting findings regarding depression. The CST results indicate that depression is more common in preoffenders than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

An ecological framework was utilized to focus on the interaction between the counselor and the staff to understand this relationships and the context in which it occurs [6]. The men in this study were very active help seekers but not occasionally. They encountered many gaps in continuity of care including discharge because of relapse. Although the treatment center was a bus stop, small group people in common place, and family gate together review, medical store and men left the health center without treatment for their trauma needs and many without any referral to address these outstanding issues. Men with alcohol dependence and PTSD with a history of IPV want help however the health and social services do not always recognize their calls for help or their symptoms of distress. Recommendations are made for treatment center to become trauma- informed that would help this recognition and home yoga at home.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Ninety‐one children aged 3–6 yrs were observed and video‐recorded playing with the anatomically correct dolls in unstructured play settings. Parental permission had been obtained. The children's emotional, behavioural and overall play responses were rated Whilst the dolls’ difference from other dolls was dearly noticed, they did not traumatize the children, most of whom incorporated the dolls in imaginative play. Only five children's play with the dolls showed any sexualized quality, in three the source of sexual knowledge becoming apparent. Whereas the absence of sexualized play does not reliably exclude abuse, we suggest that explicit sexual play with the dolls may well arise from previous exposure: to explicit sexual information or activity.",

      "abstract": "While domestic violence and child abuse are known to be highly correlated, several related areas of functioning of children are not well researched on and have implications for the provision of services. A complex pattern of results documented high levels of abuse and associated trauma disorders in children. Being exposed to violence in the home during war increases risk of developing problems in mental health and psychosocial wellbeing (MHPSW), a small but robust evidence base shows that. Studies reveal that living with domestic violence can cause physical and emotional harm to children and young people in the following ways: Ongoing anxiety and depression, emotional distress, eating and sleeping disturbances. Conversely, this evidence shows that supportive parenting can be a protective factor against the demonstrated negative effects of war on children´s mental health. Evidence from multiple sources increasingly shows that exposure to war alone cannot account for how children exposed to similar war events experience different mental and psychosocial states and trajectories. Other factors, including home life, provide complementary, at times even better, explanations In fact, in many cases, factors that traumatize children stem not only from war events, but also from everyday hardships. Home life can be a moderator, and potentially a mediator, of the effects of war.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Juveniles are subject to many types of victimization, from property crimes to assaults and homicides. However, because children are dependent on adult caretakers, they can also be the victims of crimes not commonly seen among adults (e.g., neglect). When juveniles are victimized by parents or guardians, this is frequently referred to as child abuse or intrafamilial victimization (e.g., physical abuse) and when they are victimized by acquaintances and strangers who do not have responsibility for the child's well‐being, this is referred to as extrafamilial victimization (e.g., theft). Regardless of who commits the offense, research finds that juvenile victims suffer a number of outcomes, including physical and mental health problems, and that those who are victimized are at greater risk of later revictimization and offending behavior. Historically, juveniles were hidden victims, because laws and culture condoned paternal “abuse.” However, technological development, media focus on child abuse, and tragic cases like the Columbine High School shootings have resulted in a new appreciation for the level of violence and crime experienced by young people. Further, they have brought about the development of policies to deal with the special needs of juvenile victims.",

Identity formation during adolescence is strongly affected by hormonal/body changes, the effects of culture and society, and cognitive and emotional difficulties. For adolescents, the new changes happening in their bodies can be overwhelming. Many things must be considered in a psychodynamic formulation that come to the fore in adolescence. For example, one's sense of gender is generally consolidated much earlier. Sexual identity may be somewhat fluid for adolescents, and experimentation is the norm. Adolescence may also be the time when cognitive and emotional difficulties first appear. Many factors can disrupt identity consolidation in adolescence. As always, traumas, family strife, and losses must be considered. A very common source of trouble in this area is drug and alcohol use disorders. Adult patients are likely to have strong memories of adolescence.",

Successful navigation of the social environment requires individuals to adapt to continually changing stimuli. Stress impacts health by impairing an individual's ability to adapt. Impairments in the ability to adapt may result in significant challenges to mental and physical well‐being in the form of psychological distress and/or the development of chronic disease. Men and women are often exposed to different types of stressors and different levels of stress, and tend to respond differently to stress. This results in varying health outcomes. Inquiries into the relationship between gender, stress, and health have increased understanding of the processes by which adaptability is compromised. Gender is one of the major ways in which individuals organize their lives, and most people fail to realize its strong influence on social life.",

If these factors (or one of which) are missing, one suffers from psychological insecurity. The effects of psychological security are: 1- horrific fear of failure, extreme caution, aggression and carelessness, superiority complex, isolation from society, and inferiority complex. The effects of one’s being religious enhance their freedom of only worshipping of Allah Almighty. This also leads individuals to be responsible, content and brave concerning their rights. Furthermore, this encourages societies to respect one another without any of which feeling superior or better than others.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining a good work ability depends on satisfactory health and employment status, which is supported by suitable working conditions and correct life styles. From the biological perspective, ageing means a foreseeable progressive and overall deterioration of the various physiological systems, but not of such a kind and severity to consider most people over 50 as too old or unfit for work, as has been shown by several studies that assessed work ability not only in terms of biological age, but of functional age and actual work output. From the physio-pathological perspective, we can observe either illnesses associated with the passage of time or age-related changes that might precipitate diseases, as well as environmental changes that modulate ageing and developmental changes that accelerate or retard ageing. From the practical point of view, it should taken into account that job demands often do not follow the natural biological and functional changes of the individual, consequently the relative work load can be higher in older workers. On the other hand, ageing also means a professional growth in terms of strategic ability, shrewdness, wisdom and experience. The high interindividual variability of physical, mental and social conditions that is observed with the increase in age makes it necessary to adopt flexible and personally tailored measures, as shown by recent surveys in some European countries aimed at reducing age discrimination and work disability, and at promoting work ability by means of actions directed towards both improvement of work organisation and support of psycho-physical conditions of older workers.",

Research in developmental psychology has shown that even very young children help and that the presence of others can actually increase helping in some cases. In the current study, in contrast, 5-year-old children helped an experimenter at very high levels when they were alone but helped significantly less often in the presence of bystanders who were potentially available to help. In another condition designed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the effect, children’s helping was not reduced when bystanders were present but confined behind a barrier and thus unable to help (a condition that has not been run in previous studies with adults). Young children thus show the bystander effect, and it is due not to social referencing or shyness to act in front of others but, rather, to a sense of a diffusion of responsibility.",

      "title": "Intersecting Identities and Experience of Sensory Loss",
      "abstract": "Societies have historically reduced people to a binary classification: typical or atypical. Historically, groups have been considered to be atypical based on characteristics or identities such as age, disability status, racial/ethnic identity, and sexual orientation. Being considered atypical, or different from majority groups in societies, often leads to marginalisation, stigmatisation, and oppression. A person who belongs to more than one atypical group experiences marginalisation, stigmatisation, and/or oppression differently from members of each group that they are part of. Multiple social identities (e.g., age, disability, race) that intersect at the level of the individual are related to systems of privilege and oppression at the societal level (e.g., agism, ableism, racism). This chapter provides readers with an overview of how intersecting identities and experience of sensory loss may shape the experiences of the clients with whom professionals work. Understanding this is key to providing quality and equitable services to people with sensory loss. Case studies of people with multiple social identities are presented to illustrate the impact of intersecting identities on the opportunities and outcomes of people with hearing, vision, or dual sensory loss.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Gender dysphoria (GD) is defined as a marked incongruence between their experienced or expressed gender and the one they were assigned at birth. Case summary: A 17-year-old male from low socioeconomic status presented with repeated inclinations to be dressed up and move like a female for the past 11 years and for past 3 months with sleep disturbance, low mood and loss of interest in surroundings, and occasional passive death wishes. There was no physical ambiguity regarding his male sex at birth. During early age, he preferred to play with girls and enjoyed the role, wearing their traditional clothes without getting any sexual pleasure in doing so. Due to this behavior, he was criticized continuously by his father and faced strong opposition from all his relatives when he expressed his wish to become a transgender. He was diagnosed with Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults with mild depressive episode and treatment was initiated. Discussion: GD occurs when an individual strongly believes that he or she was born with the body of the wrong sex. People suffering from GD were prone to serious illnesses ranging from emotional distress, depression, isolation, and in worst cases, suicide. Hence, there is an urgent need to create awareness to perceive gender expression as a continuum reducing the burden of mental health problems associated with GD. Conclusion: GDD is a difficult condition to deal and treat, especially in individuals with orthodox and low socioeconomic backgrounds.",

      "title": "Illegitimacy.",
      "abstract": "The word \"illegitmate\" in most English dictionaries is defined as \"bastard\" and \"bastard\" is defined as \"illegitimate.\" Etymology is also not very helpful. It is not enough to know the etymology of a word, and it is not sufficient to know the social consequences of the distinctions marked out by words. It is also necessary to know the point of the social distinction. Most societies make a distinction between individuals born legitimately and those whose conception and/or birth breaks an important social rule. The content of the social rules which differentiate between licit and illict birth is not a fixed thing. It varies between societies and between different times in history. The emphasis is on marriage and extra-marital birth is considered as the prototype or paradigm of illegitimacy. In some societies it is incest, or adultery, or miscegnation, or intercourse between persons of different religions or castes or classes which provides the prototype. Illegitimacy, or the legitimate-illegitimate distinction, is a side-effect of the fact that humans control the reproduction of their own species. Human control of reproduction is exercised by a mixture of both physical means and ideology. The physical means include the separation of the sexes, abortion, contraception, and infanticide. The ideology of reproduction control and the ideological means of control are of greater signficance than the physical means, for they reflect the fact that the point of controlling human reproduction differs greatly from the point of controlling animal reproduction. The fundamental form of birth control is marriage and marriage law, for it is marriage which determines who shall reproduce the species and when. Marriage law and marriage customs cover a wide range of rules. The overall objective of marriage law and custom is to control birth for the purpose of organizing human society into families, kin groups, lineages, and nations. This organization in turn provides the means whereby one generation rears and educates the members of the next. In the 20th century anxiety regarding rapid population growth has been added to the traditional reasons for controlling birth. Important moral issues associated with illegitimacy are briefly reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Women tend to live longer than men, and thus typically have more interactions with the healthcare system in old age than men do. Ageism and stereotypes of older people in general can have an important impact on elders’ physical and mental health and well‐being. For example, internalized negative stereotypes can produce self‐fulfilling prophecies through stereotype embodiment and contribute to weakness and dependency. Ageist beliefs and stereotypes can interfere with health care seeking as well as with diagnosis and treatment recommendations; they can, for example, contribute to gender disparities in the health care of older adults if older women are perceived as too frail to undergo aggressive treatments. Ageism also results in disrespectful treatment of older patients, which is communicated through baby talk and other forms of infantilization or the shrugging off of patients’ complaints and concerns as “just old age.” Intersectional identities can result in a cumulative burden for older women patients who may have a history of disrespectful treatment for other reasons (e.g., sexism, racism, bias against lesbians). Reduction of ageism and sexism and promotion of more realistic and diverse views of older women could improve doctor–patient relationships, facilitate adherence to treatment regimens, and reduce disparities in health and health care.",

      "abstract": "In this review, the author evaluates the empirical support for the claims that various aspects of family dysfunction are risk factors for completed suicide or suicidal symptoms in childhood or adolescence. There is consistent evidence that a history of physical or sexual abuse is a risk factor and some evidence for other risk factors, including poor family or parent-child communication, loss of caregiver to separation or death, and psychopathology in first-degree relatives. However, the researchers of the vast majority of studies did not attend to whether the putative risk factors preceded the development of suicidal symptoms; thus, most of the claims regarding family risk factors are not justified by their research designs and findings.",

Children have been traditionally viewed as the property of parents or of the State, devoid of any rights, with no recourse or protection from violence, abuse or mistreatment. The exploitation of children has included forced labour— often under hazardous conditions—recruitment in armed conflict, slavery, sexual exploitation and trafficking, and the use of children in criminal activities. Such abuses have had severe repercussions for the physical and mental development of children worldwide. Learning and education have also been commonly reserved for the privileged few, which often excluded girls.",

Feared retaliation, perceived stigmatization, desire not to leave home and protect wrong doer and difficulty in communicating, are close similarities with child abuse. Grave difference is that death of older person is rarely scrutinized carefully. It is regardless of risk factors of possible abuse or neglect as it is for children and younger victims of sexual and domestic violence, who are healthy and unexpected to die. Additional differences include old age often bringing medical and physiological attributes that mimics or masks, markers of elder abuse and neglect, further complicating analysis and detection. Elderly have multiple medical problems and dependencies, misguiding assumption that these are prone to stressors causing natural death. Factually, older persons have fewer support systems and reserves—physical, psychological, and economic, magnifying impact of abuse and neglect. A single mistreatment is more likely to trigger a downward spiral, leading to dependency, serious complicating illness and even death.",

      "title": "[Adolescent pregnancy].",
      "abstract": "This exploration of adolescent pregnancy focuses on adolescents whose pregnancies are undesired. The physical and psychic transformations of puberty and adolescence may be experienced differently in different social contexts. The prolongation of school attendance in Western societies means that most adolescents remain financially dependent on their parents. But greater sexual freedom in the society at large has been reflected in an increase in early sexual activity among adolescents. Wider use of contraception has not completely eliminated prenatal pregnancy among adolescents. Adolescent pregnancies have actually declined in France as a proportion of all pregnancies carried to term, from 4% to 1.5-2% in the past 10 or 15 years. But in 1986, 42.5% of all induced abortions were performed on adolescents. Among causes of unwanted pregnancy in adolescents are their frequent inability to believe that they may be at risk of pregnancy, or that pregnancy can result from the 1st sexual intercourse. The episodic nature of sexual relations, the lack of ready availability of contraception, and specific shortcomings of different methods are factors in the frequent failure of adolescents to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Adolescents may become pregnant out of loneliness or to prove that they are women, or as a result of incest or prostitution. Adolescents who seek abortions are those who have discovered and acknowledged their pregnancies before the 12th week and had the courage to inform their parents and obtain legal permission for the abortion. Pregnancy terminations are more frequent in more advantaged societal sectors with more structured family life. The moral shock and sense of failure associated with abortion are often deeply felt by adolescents. Their experience is greatly influenced by the attitudes of those around them. Adolescents who carry their pregnancies to term are those who have not sought abortion in the 1st 12 weeks. Often they refuse to admit they might be pregnant. But adolescents from disadvantaged environments may wish to continue the pregnancy in order to attain social status. Most parents eventually resign themselves to the pregnancy. Adolescents who are closely monitored usually have normal pregnancies and deliveries. The proportion of adolescent mothers who place their infants for adoption has declined. Most of the infants kept by their mothers are entitled to 2 sets of social prestations, the allowances for the young infant and for single parents. School nurses have an important potential contribution in informing students about sexuality and contraception and in assisting those who become pregnant.",

Only with my closest confidant, my partner, did any semblance of sexuality emerge, mediated by images and symbols imbibed as a teenager. My deep desire for connection that extended into sexuality felt ossified and unaired—kept in an air-sealed wrapper, like a vintage toy to be sold in the future or admired on a shelf. The sexuality that emerges from within me doesn't feel constrained and defined by borders or the models used by the dominant culture. It is lush, verdant, warm, damp. It is not a shape defined by others. It is not attached to gender. It is not a taxonomical category to which I ascribe. My sexuality extends from the love that I easily feel towards other bodyminds like mine and the intimacy with which I seek to imbue relations. It need not be segregated and distinct.",

Although the phrase language deprivation syndrome may be new, the observation, that deficits observed in some deaf people's life skills might be due not to sensory deprivation or to social impoverishment, but specifically to deprivation, is not. Language deprivation is often the unintended outcome of well-intentioned efforts to promote a child's development. The existence of deprivation is a corollary to the existence of a critical period for learning one's first language. The most severe cases of deprivation therefore follow a child's not being exposed to consistent and fully elaborated during the entire critical period, approximately the first five years of life. Language deprivation persists in large part because it crosses the boundaries of multiple professional disciplines, none of which is solely responsible for a child's outcome.",

      "abstract": "While there is a longer history of concern about alcohol's harm to others, researchers' interest has intensified in the last few years. The background of variation in concern over time in different societies is outlined. Three main traditions of research have emerged: population survey studies of such harm from the perspective of the ‘other’; analysis of register or case-record data which includes information on the involvement of another's drinking in the case; and qualitative studies of interactions and experiences involved in particular harms from others' drinking. In the course of the new spate of studies, many conceptual and methodological issues have arisen, some of which are considered in the paper. The diverse types of harms which have been studied are discussed. The social and personal nature of many of the harms means they do not ft easily into a disability or costing model, raising questions about how they might best be counted and aggregated. Harm from others' drinking is inherently interactional, and subject to varying definitions of what counts as harm. The attribution to drinking, in the usual situation of conditional causation, is also subject to variation, with moral politics potentially coming into play. For measurement and comparison, account needs to be taken of cultural and individual variations in perceptions and thresholds of what counts as a harm, and attribution to alcohol. The view from the windows of a population survey and of a response agency case register are often starkly different, and research is needed, as an input and spur to policy initiatives, on what influences this difference and whether and how the views might be reconciled.",

When it is a question of attacks and physical violence of an anti-Semitic nature, schools seem even less capable of dealing with the problems in a satisfactory manner. Anti-Semitism in schools is undoubtedly a reality.

In a recent national poll, 95 percent of Americans professed a belief in God, and 67 to 75 percent of respondents reported that they pray on a daily basis [1]. Research findings showed that although regular attendance at church was not necessary, a strong personal importance placed on spirituality or religion was most protective against major depression in people who were at high familial risk. Religious beliefs serve an important function in the daily lives and attitudes of most of us. Religious activity embraces beliefs, experiences, and practice. Conversely, a person’s fervent religious practices can also signify other, gloomier facets of his or her mental health. The term used to define such a case is hyperreligiosity in the case of religious beliefs. The question of excess or hyper becomes a factor when the religion begins adversely affecting people’s social behavior and their ability to function rationally. A number of potential genetic and pathophysiological causes of violence and aggression have been investigated over recent years. Research now points to the discovery that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of defective emotion regulation circuitry in the brain.",

But when, and why, is it morally problematic? I argue that in many cases everyday lookism is wrongful because it involves morally objectionable appearance discrimination. I consider various respects in which everyday lookism can be morally objectionable in virtue of the acts of wrongful discrimination it involves. I argue that these acts are wrongful when they are demeaning, or when they have unjust consequences whether singly or cumulatively. There are a number of ways in which they may have unjust consequences. First, the appearance norms in which these acts are rooted may be biased in such a way that the acts contribute to creating an unjust distribution of benefits and burdens. Second, these acts may combine to make everyday lookism oppressive in virtue of impairing the personal autonomy of its victims or contributing to doing so. Third, these acts may be unjustly harmful in terms of their effects.",

The emotional regulation is a process whereby people seek to redirect the course of their emotions. The selection or avoidance of situations is one of these strategies. Faced with an emotionally intense situation, either negative or positive, and from a subjective assessment, subjects anticipate the likely emotional consequences. This can trigger selection or avoidance strategies. The efficacy of this process is based on a balance between search for wellbeing and avoidance of discomfort, in a way that predominantly the result is emotionally positive. Different studies suggest that older people tend, more than younger people, to de seek of maintenance and a predominance of a positive emotionality. The results obtained in this study show common aspects as regard to selection strategy. However, some differences appear. In youth, others attitudes is a source of negative emotions. In middle-age, family problems and political opinions are source of rage. In older people, everything that refers to the negative aspects of ageing, such as sickness and passivity, is avoided. The avoidance in older people doesn’t imply a scape, but rather neutralization or balance between their social compromise and their emotional equilibrium.",

When lacking knowledge about abuse indicators, these persons are, evidently, unable to report it, which can lead to repeated abuse. Moreover, in many cases, these people do not know that they have the right to decide, refuse, be asked permission (every time), rethink a decision or change their minds. On the other hand, sexuality is often mistaken for sex. Actually, the concept of sexuality is much wider and includes identities, roles, intimacy, pleasure and spirituality. Sexual education and counseling must not be a one-time “talk” (that usually takes place during puberty), but a process of communication, counseling and support which starts at early ages, continues during the school years and goes further, during adulthood. The emotional, psycho-sexual, social, ethical and spiritual aspects also continue their development in the adult life and it is only natural to be properly approached at these ages as well.",

      "title": "Psychological development",
      "abstract": "Psychological development refers to growth and progress on the full gamut of human dimensions across the lifespan. The study of psychological development has been concerned with questions such as: What develops?; In what sequence?; Are there identifiable stages and phases of development?; What processes underlie developmental change?; Are there general principles of development and change that apply across all ages?; What factors enhance or retard development?; What explains inter-individual differences?; and To what extent is development socially and culturally determined? An engagement with the literature reveals a range of very different theoretical and empirical approaches to the above questions. Furthermore, the questions that are posed are typically framed within a particular theoretical position and/or contain basic theoretical assumptions about development. In the developmental literature there are two broad fields of enquiry: one concerned with the devel-opment of cognitive and intellectual capabilities across the lifespan; the other concerned with social and emotional development or one's sense of self or identity. The early research in both these fields of enquiry focused on child development – arguably because of the need to understand children's learning given the growth of education in the latter part of the nineteenth century and also because of a commonly held belief that adult maturity was the end-point of development. Nowadays a great deal of research has been undertaken on adult development. Once again this may beconnected with the need for adults to engage in lifelong learning in the context of continuing technological, social and organisational change and the subsequent increasing educational provision for adults in formal and informal settings throughout life. A common thread in the developmental literature, then, has been the application of developmental theories across the entire lifespan. In many ways the application of developmental theories to adults has raised new questions and issues that have helped shape thinking in relation to the development of children. For example, in adult developmental research there has been a general move away from identifying common sequences of predictable stages and phases, which characterised earlier attempts to document development. Instead the emphasis is now placed on the impact of social and historical factors in accounting for multidirectional change and variability in life trajectories (see for example, Smith and Baltes, 1999; Elder, 1998). Research into child development has followed suit, paying greater attention to the social and historical factors that influence the direction and timing of development. Of course this trend is also a response to the increasing need to recognise cultural diversity among those attending educational institutions. I am not suggesting that the pragmatic needs of educators alone drive the theory construction of developmental psychologists in a direct and explicit way, however,it is clear that broad social concerns, including those of educators, provide a context in which it is possible for developmental theorists to raise new questions and issues in their research. It is also worth noting that the education sector is a major user of the research on developmental psychology and this is understandable given that both education and developmental psychology have a common focus on learning.",

People do not need to understand people with different sexual orientations, but they should respect them.",

      "title": "Early childhood sexual abuse increases suicidal intent",
      "abstract": "Childhood sexual abuse has been consistently associated with suicidal behavior. We studied suicide attempt features in depressed individuals sexually abused as children. On average, sexual abuse started before age 9. It frequently coexisted with physical abuse. Suicide attempters more often had personality disorders and had endured abuse for longer, but did not differ in terms of other clinical characteristics from non‐attempters. Earlier onset of sexual abuse and its duration were associated with more suicide attempts. However, when personality disorders were included in the regression model, only these disorders predicted number of attempts. The severity of sexual abuse and the coexistence of physical abuse were correlated with age at first suicide attempt. However, only severity of sexual abuse was marginally associated with age at first suicide attempt in the regression model. Finally, the earlier the age of onset of sexual abuse, the higher the intent, even after controlling for age, sex and personality disorders. This suggests that the characteristics of childhood sexual abuse, especially age of onset, should be considered when studying the risk for suicidal behavior in abused populations.",

      "title": "PSYCHOSEXUAL DEVELOPMENT AND ABSENCE OF HOMOSEXUALITY IN MALES WITH PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY",
      "abstract": "Four males with idiopathic sexual precocity and 14 males with sexual precocity secondary to virilizing adrenal hyperplasia were seen in a longitudinal study of psychosexual development for up to 18 years. The distinguishing psychological traits of sexual precocity in the male so far uncovered are: a tendency to high IQ, as previously reported by Money and Lewis (17) and Money and Meredith (18); increased energy expenditure, especially in infancy; a possible increased incidence (by no means universal) of behavior tantrums and impulsive anger; early occurrence of the capacity for frankly sexual imagery in dreams and daydreams, its content, however, determined by cognitional experience; and early establishment of the capacity for erotic and sexual arousal in relation to visual imagery and visual perception as well as tactile sensation. It is possible, though not proven, that by influencing development of central nervous system pathways in utero, or by a triggering mechanism later in pubertal childhood, androgen may be responsible for these various traits. The psychological maturation of males with physical sexual precocity otherwise keeps in step with that of boys of the same chronological and/or social age. Accelerated social maturation may be deliberately fostered in order to bridge the gap between chronological age and physique age.",

Existen varios mitos y estereotipos en torno a la sexualidad de las personas con discapacidad; la misma gente es capaz de mermar drásticamente la expresión sexual de estas personas, como pensar que son asexuales y que dependen de los demás. También existe una devaluación de la percepción corporal que dificulta apreciarse como un sujeto sexualmente atractivo. A esto se suman otros factores que pueden ser considerados un obstáculo para la vida sexual, como el dolor, el uso de fármacos, incontinencia urinaria o fecal, la dificultad para adoptar ciertas posiciones para realizar el coito e incluso el temor a la muerte. Es indudable que la vida sexual de las personas discapacitadas tiene una especificidad, bien en sí misma, bien por las condiciones en que pueden vivirla. Cada discapacidad supone una cierta especificidad en la forma de vivir la sexualidad, cada discapacitado y cada contexto familiar y social también, los discapacitados tienen posibilidades y formas muy diferentes de vivir la sexualidad. Las personas con discapacidad, son personas sexuales y tienen un amplio rango de necesidades emocionales y sexuales y los mismos problemas que las personas con cuerpos hábiles. Tienen los mismos derechos sexuales y la posibilidad de involucrarse totalmente en interrelaciones emocionales y sexuales.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality with a disabling disease, or serious disabling or disability: a sensitive subject probably due to the association of the two words: sexuality and disability. The question of the emotional life, the life of a couple, the sexuality of a person living with a disability remains a real social and cultural problem. This necessarily impacts on the people concerned because they are victims of their states of disability. This is a subject that is difficult to address both by the couple, by society and by health professionals. In addition, it should be noted that regardless of their physical or psychological state, their visible or invisible disability, their chronic, serious, rare, disabling or disabling illness, or simply their difference, everyone has their own sexual identity. The feeling of love, the affective life, the sexual life of a person with a disability, their life as a couple, pleasure, do not disappear with the onset of illness or disability, it is accessible to all, disabled, sick, in a couple or single, married or not, all have the right to sexuality, to an emotional life regardless of their physical appearance, their mental handicap or other differences... However, for many people in a situation of disability, living one's sexuality remains a difficult aspect in their life as a couple, or not, or in their daily lives. Disability, whatever its origin, can contribute to the alteration or changes in the sexual life of a lambda individual, thus affecting his sexuality, his sexual pleasure... Health professionals are often confronted with suffering, physical and/or psychological pain. However, even today the question of the fulfillment and sexual serenity of people with disabilities remains a silent subject, an unresolved issue, not popularized, not a priority if I can put it that way, but the question of pleasure sex is often overlooked. It would seem that social representations approach the subject of the affective relationship and the love life of sick or disabled people, their life as a couple, their intimacy as a couple, their affective and love life, as being abnormality in the face of what they consider \"normal\".",

      "title": "Tobacco smoking as a form of child abuse",
      "abstract": "Child abuse emerged from the shadows half a century ago and is now recognised as a major public health issue. It is now realised that child abuse encompasses physical, psychological and social aspects, as well as sexual elements. It extends beyond obviously aggressive acts to include neglect, lack of adequate protection and failure to nurture. It is no longer accepted that parents and other adults punish those who depend on them at their discretion. The epoch of the Roman pater familias, with a right of life and death over family members (and slaves) is over. It is accepted that the state, with its legal ‘monopoly of legitimate violence’ may sometimes have to invade the private sphere of individuals and families if it is to detect and prevent ill-treatment, despite some exquisite sensitivities in this regard. But the threshold is ill-defined. Adverse reactions to ‘curiosity’ by outsiders may be justified by a families’ alleged freedom to treat their members as they choose. Yet an overly cautious approach may lead to serious situations being detected when it is already too late. In the 1990s Europe has been shaken by gruesome cases of ill-treatment of children, in particular involving sexual abuse, and sometimes with lethal consequences (the Dutroux affair in Belgium attracting most public attention). Health and related professionals must be diligent about situations where there is a risk of abuse so as to prevent it happening. Of course these professionals, whether privately or publicly employed, should aim for balanced decisions, respecting the rights of the persons concerned as well as maintaining what lawyers describe as proportionality. But it is also imperative to show some courage. In this respect, one should not refrain from speaking out about smoking as a form of child abuse. Such abuse, which may take place in a variety of situations, may not have the same dramatic features than broken limbs, haematomas and brain concussions have, but it is ill-treatment nevertheless.",

      "abstract": "Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults may be more vulnerable to elder abuse (EA) due to prior marginalization and trauma, lifelong discrimination, and health disparities. While characteristics of both victims and perpetrators can modify the risk for EA, few studies have focused on perpetrators. This study examined the number and type of perpetrator-victim relationships and perpetrator profiles for EA experienced in the prior year, by abuse type and sexual orientation and gender identity of the abused. Data are from community-dwelling Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging participants aged 65 or older at follow-up 1 (n = 23,466). Heterosexual men and women reported being abused psychologically and physically most often by spouses or partners. Gay and bisexual (GB) men reported being abused psychologically most often by non-family, non-friend “others”. Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women reported psychological and financial abuse most often by siblings or other family members, and physical abuse by non-family, non-friend “others”. Heterosexual women were abused financially most often by their children, and both heterosexual and GB men reported more financial abuse by “others” or friends. Overall, 15% and 5% of participants reported abuse by multiple perpetrators of psychological and financial abuse respectively. LB women experienced more EA overall (18.8%), by multiple perpetrators (31% for psychological abuse, 66.5% for financial abuse) including by their siblings and other family members. These results have important implications for mitigation and preventive measures. They also highlight the need for further research concerning sexual minorities experiencing multiple abuse types and/or abuse by multiple perpetrators.",

It is constructed over time and encumbered with interpretants according to the needs and preconceptions of those who argue they search only for the truth. The act of quarantining an individual or a community is an expression of governmental power, equal in its effect and the strength of its narrative to the government's authority to institutionalize the mentally ill, deprive criminals of their liberty, and draft individuals to serve in the armed forces. Power flows from and accrues to those who have been granted the right to identify and group those bodily “signs” that designate someone as dangerous. The public will likely be faced many times with a potentially fatal and infectious disease that requires that we identify and isolate those considered dangerous; we will once again face the ethical dilemma of how to choose between individual rights and the public's safety. Who is to be isolated from the balance of society, for what period of time, and under what conditions, may depend more on the individual's social, economic, and political status and categorization as “other” than upon his/her actual threat to the public's health.",

      "abstract": "L’addiction sexuelle débute à l’âge adulte jeune avec un ratio hommes/femmes variant de 2 à 5/1. Le nombre de consultation pour ce motif a augmenté en France mais à ce jour, aucune étude épidémiologique n’a été menée. Différents facteurs déclenchent le comportement addictif sexuel (émotions positives, négatives, circonstances environnementales). La consommation sexuelle est excessive et concerne différents supports sexuels. Il y a au moins un orgasme quotidien pendant au moins 6 mois mais celui-ci s’accompagne toujours d’une perte contrôle, d’une perte de temps à préparer le comportement, le réaliser ou à récupérer de ses effets. Les patients dépendants au sexe se construisent une deuxième vie et sont dans la crainte permanente que cette vie, toujours dissociée de l’amour, soit découverte. La réalisation fréquente du comportement sexuel addictif altère les obligations professionnelles, familiales ou sociales. La notion de trouble hypersexualité repose sur des critères cliniques suffisamment fréquents et intenses pour entraîner des altérations du fonctionnement personnel et social sur une période d’au moins 6 mois : perte de temps ; comportements répétitifs, réalisés en réponse à un état dépressif, anxieux, à un ennui, à des événements de vie stressants ; difficultés répétées pour contrôler ou réduire de manière significative des fantasmes/envies/activités sexuelles ; engagement répétitif dans des activités sexuelles en dépit du risque de conséquences physiques ou émotionnelles pour soi ou pour les autres ; fréquence et intensité importantes des comportements sexuels. Il existe différentes formes cliniques qui sont la masturbation compulsive, la consommation compulsive de pornographie, le cybersexe, les conversations érotiques au téléphone, la fréquentation compulsive de clubs, et la séduction compulsive. Les complications de cette pathologie peuvent être d’ordre somatique, psychologique et social. La prise en charge doit être intégrée et multimodale en combinant thérapie cognitive et comportementale, soutien, approche pharmacologique, thérapie de couple et groupes d’auto-support.",

The effects of modernization, specifically in Sikkim, have led to sweeping changes in the socioeconomic, socio-philosophical and cultural arenas of people's lives, which have greatly added to the stress in life, leading to substantially higher rates of suicide.

This differs markedly from a concept of mental health as the absence of mental disease, for it centers on a positive goal toward which to drive, rather than a negative one from which to recede--progress by walking backwards, as it were. If one adheres to this positive motivation of mental hygiene, i.e. working toward an ideal, he finds an incentive to progress over a wide range of possible achievement; whereas to strive merely for the absence of mental disease leaves one unmoved by the larger wastage of unrealized potentialities and satisfactions.",

The word regression does not have only the behavioral meaning of coming apart or backsliding; it may also mean recentering or reaveraging in certain interesting clinical situations. To the statistician, may mean several different things. These multiple meanings can confuse the nonstatistician clinician. At least five concepts or associations have an aspect that relates to regression: (1) the line , depicting the relationship of two variables observed from each element",

Of course loss or impairment of physical functions can be problematic: people who cannot see, hear, walk or clothe themselves obviously have to learn to adapt to their limited capabilities. However physical conditions such as these need not necessarily lead to social problems or social exclusion, and indeed they do not always do so. When assistance or support can be purchased or provided disabled people can and do participate fully in modern society. If they do not participate, and if they experience poverty and exclusion, it is because of their need to survive within structures that assume people are 'able-bodied' and that provide no support for those who are not — or may even directly exclude them. It is thus discrimination, rather than disability itself, which as the heart of the exclusion experienced by disabled people — and at the same time of their greater risk of poverty. For as Groves (1988, p. 171) put it, 'Poverty is disability's close companion'.",

      "title": "Online Child Safety from Sexual Abuse in India",
      "abstract": "1. Introduction The World Health Organization defines child sexual abuse as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society. Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person. This may include but is not limited to the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful activity, the exploitative use of a child in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices, the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials (1). A similar definition has been stated in Article 18 of The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, 2007 which is yet to enter into force (2). The risks that minors face online include sexual solicitation, exposure to problematic and illegal content as well as harassment and bullying. These risks are not confined to their local area but occur from people all around the world. Parents and teachers do not have direct experience with the risks posed by new-media technologies. Addressing the risks online therefore carries different challenges and requires broader collaboration to find innovative solutions (3). The need for a multi-layered approach to internet governance in India is highlighted by a comparative study of the various measures available internationally to make communications over the information and communication technologies safe. A concerted effort is very essential from various actors in order to prevent online child sexual abuse. Those who can help report child sexual abuse have been identified as social-service workers, healthcare practitioners, education providers, law enforcement officers, photo developers, IT professionals, ISPs, credit card companies and banks (4). Other actors are telecom service providers, network service providers, web-hosting service providers, search engines, online payment sites, online-auction sites, online-market places, and cyber cafes. A multi-level sensitisation about the need to collect statistics as well as report suspected internet child abuse should be effected among these actors. In India, the government does not take a pro-active stand against child sexual abuse, in contrast to the USA where law enforcement officials lure potential sex offenders in decoy. In sting operations conducted in the USA, where paedophiles are lured over the internet to contact people below the age of consent over the Internet for sexual liaisons, many highly-educated and well-to-do Indians are turning up as potential molesters. This is particularly disturbing, as there are no statistics on this in India (5). Child-to-child solicitation and abuse through the medium of mobile telecommunications is becoming a serious problem in India. Other kinds of abuse occur through social networking sites like Orkut where pictures of girls have been posted on communities with lewd allusions and a listing of the victims' mobile numbers. With new-media technologies available at lower costs, child sex abuse images are being increasingly made and uploaded from India (6). In a recent case in Kerala State, three girls committed suicide after increasing blackmail that the film of classmates raping them which had been taken on a mobile camera would be publicly circulated. Generally, it is a fact that unwanted publicity and fear of victimisation by law enforcement machinery are reasons why the largely conventional Indian families fear reporting child sexual abuse. 2. A Comparative analysis regarding definition and criminalisation of Online Child Sexual Abuse The word 'online' means all forms of information and communication technologies like the internet, mobile phones etc. …",

Elderly people, as is often assumed, might lose out in the trend towards odernization because they are less likely to have technological know-how. Against this general background, this paper aims to link new technology with loneliness in advanced age. Although lack of social contact and social support are hypothesized to be essential influences on loneliness, this study seeks to enrich the psychological understanding of loneliness by introducing a new flow of arguments including technology issues as follows: First, two key elements of technological competence, i.e., experience with and acceptance of technology, are assumed to positively influence one‘s perception of ‘being in control’. Going further, they may also prevent older adults from feeling obsolete or marginal in an increasingly hi-tech world. Second, individual dispositions such as control beliefs or perceived obsolescence may contribute to the interpretation of and response to deficits in social relationships and thus mediate technology effects on the experience of loneliness in old age. Supporting empirical evidence for this conceptual avenue is presented.",

This central role of sexuality in a person's life is affected by health or illness and by many psychologic factors. Physicians have the opportunity to assess the sexual function in the course of routine history taking; however, this is rarely done. Additionally, many doctors are uncomfortable with the patient's questions about sexuality and feel uneasy about broaching the subject themselves. In some cases, they feel that such questions are an intrusion on the patient's privacy, even though they realize that bowel and drug habits, cigarette and alcohol use and reproductive status are also private matters. In other cases, they believe that the patient's sexual concerns are not of medical significance or that their own ability to treat such concerns is limited. In this way, they ignore or dismiss the patient's concerns.",

Jealousy characteristically involves hostility if not hatred towards the person who is taking away the love one feels is due to one, and engenders bitterness, hostility, or hatred towards the person one loved. Like many emotions, envy and jealousy provide motives for action. For in both cases there are characteristic patterns of backward- and forward-looking reasons for action. There are numerous biblical tales to illustrate the evils of envy, and others that demonstrate the vice of jealousy. For the most part, qin'ah is condemned as a serious and self-destructive vice.",

Consequences from these types of violence range from direct traumas to the less recognizable social, cultural, economic, and health consequences that may be at first be hidden. Health consequences can be both physical and psychological, with short- and long-term effects. Consequences may be different according to type of violence, but they may also follow principles that are common to all types. Stigma, isolation, and violence itself make the study of consequences difficult. Theories about the cyclical natural of violence, for example, show how violence can lead to other forms of violence. There is also a link between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and adulthood health outcomes that uncover the widespread and enduring effects of violence. The costs of violence's consequences are enormous, highlighting the benefits of prevention. Better data collection could aid in directing prevention efforts and in reducing consequences.",

      "abstract": "Right-wing populism entails discursive divisions both between ‘the people’ and ‘the elite’, and between ‘the majority’ in society and ‘minorities’. In both instances, the former are attributed with positive attributes and characteristics, while the latter are invariably ascribed negative connotations and qualities, to the extent of being portrayed as inimical to ‘the people’ or ‘the majority’, and possible even a threat to national identity or security. Through such ideologically define or socially constructed binary divisions and polarities, ‘the people’ or ‘the majority’ are portrayed as being decent, hard-working, imbued with common-sense, law-abiding, loyal, and patriotic. By contrast, the ‘the elite’ is usually depicted as being corrupt, decadent, incompetent, out-of-touch, self-serving, and unpatriotic, while sundry ‘minorities’ are often accused of being deviant, disloyal, practicing unorthodox lifestyles, refusing to integrate, and subscribing to alien, or even subversive, values which are inimical to dominant or indigenous culture. Having constructed such binary divisions, the populist Right deploys discourses which perpetuates the identification of so-called ‘enemies within’ or ‘alien others’ against whom ‘the people’ and ‘the majority’ can be mobilised. Such discursive mechanisms serve simultaneously to divert popular attention from the failings or negative consequences of neoliberalism and/or right-wing policies (such as corporate greed and corruption, increasing job insecurity, inequality, and poverty), and promoted divide-and-rule, by persuading ‘the people’ and ‘the majority’ that socio-economic problems are the fault either of ‘the elite’ or sundry ‘alien’ minorities. These then serve to legitimise authoritarian policy responses, accompanied by further discourses, often entailing Biblical or military imagery and symbolism, about a Manichean battle between good and evil, or the nation-state facing a serious, even existential, threat from sundry internal or external enemies.",

      "title": "Sexual abuse of children and adolescents.",
      "abstract": "Parents, relatives, and friends may inflict their passions on children of the same or opposite sex. This is often initiated by sleeping together. Sexual abuse contributes to and causes emotional trauma, although the child's turmoil, confusion, wish for acceptance, and anxiety may be overlooked by the parent and professional. Mutual silence aided by threats adds to the anxiety. Despite the notion that reports of parental sexual exploitation of their children are usually fantasies, there appear to be increasing data that incest and sexual abuse are frequent traumata. At present, there is increased risk of lowering the incest barrier because of increased rates of divorce and step- or surrogate parenthood, since they provide additional potential for being sexually and emotionally traumatized. Sexual abuse seems to be part of a constellation involving neglect and a pathological symbiosis. That sexual abuse is emotionally traumatic is apparent, but it needs emphasizing. Children's defensive reactions may cloud this, and it may be years before such incidents are connected to symptomatic behavior, even when the child is in intensive therapy. In the reported cases, there appears to be a pattern of reactions and defenses related to the traumata that are embedded in imprinting and identification with the aggressor. This leads to sexual abuse being a legacy passed on to the next generation of victims, as the victim becomes the molester through identification. Adolescent self-destructive behavior may stem from guilt about sexually abusing younger children. Therapists may be better able to understand and deal with some of their patients' symptoms if sexual abuse is considered as a possible factor in one or both directions.",

Older persons responded to measures of generative concern, action, perceived respect, and psychological well-being at 2 time points 12 months apart. Structural equation modeling showed that at both time points, the effect of action on well-being was completely mediated by perceived respect. Moreover, a lack of perceived respect at baseline predicted a decrease in generative concern 12 months later, suggesting that, in later life, continuing concern is partly dependent on the attitudes of younger generations.

In most cases, social reaction to violence is late, inadequate and focused on the consequences, but not on the causes. \"Abuse implies an act of execution that directly inflicts damage, while neglect implies an act of non-fulfillment of something that is necessary for the well-being of a child\". The most common forms of domestic violence are physical, emotional abuse in the presence of violence against the mother, and in a lesser extent sexual abuse. In addition, there is physical, emotional, educational and medical neglect. The presence of violence against the mother and the feeling of impotence leave the same consequences as the endured violence. It is considered that children living in violent families are likely to live under cumulative stress. Traumatic responses include a wide range of conditions from acute stress reactions through post-traumatic stress disorder to complex long-lasting, repeated trauma syndrome. All children will not react to this kind of experience in the same way, with the protective and risk factors in developmental psychopathology having a significant role to play. Because of their developmental vulnerability and dependency, children are at greater risk of violence than adults. Researches point to the need for a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and prevention of child abuse, with greater interaction between health institutions, relevant centers for social work, police, court, government and non-governmental sector, and the existence of adequate family and criminal laws.",

      "title": "The wills of older people: risk factors for undue influence",
      "abstract": "Background: As people live longer, there is increasing potential for mental disorders to interfere with testamentary distribution and render older people more vulnerable to “undue influence” when they are making a will. Accordingly, clinicians dealing with the mental disorders of older people will be called upon increasingly to advise the courts about a person's vulnerability to undue influence.Method: A Subcommittee of the IPA Task Force on Testamentary Capacity and Undue Influence undertook to establish consensus on the definition of undue influence and the provision of guidelines for expert assessment of risk factors for undue influence.Results: International jurisdictions differ in their approach to the notion of undue influence. Despite differences in legal systems, from a clinical perspective, the subcommittee identified some common “red flags” which might alert the expert to risk of undue influence. These include: (i) social or environmental risk factors such as dependency, isolation, family conflict and recent bereavement; (ii) psychological and physical risk factors such as physical disability, deathbed wills, sexual bargaining, personality disorders, substance abuse and mental disorders including dementia, delirium, mood and paranoid disorders; and (iii) legal risk factors such as unnatural provisions in a will, or provisions not in keeping with previous wishes of the person making the will, and the instigation or procurement of a will by a beneficiary.Conclusion: This review provides some guidance for experts who are requested by the courts to provide an opinion on the risk of undue influence. Whilst international jurisdictions require different thresholds of proof for a finding of undue influence, there is good international consensus on the clinical indicators for the concept.",

      "abstract": "In loving relationships, one risks temptation either to give up one's autonomy or to abridge the other person's. Since loving relationships can produce dispositions, one risks developing a long-term disposition to do so. In order to protect against this risk, a person can develop a contrary disposition, one that will nurture autonomy. I argue that receptivity is such a disposition. I define receptivity as the ability to be with someone without having to impose careless or compulsive expectations. I explain this definition using research from psychology and neuroscience about biases, defense mechanisms, and other cognitive and motivational features common to most people. Since receptivity involves sufficient control of or independence from these cognitive and motivational features, and since they are often the cause of breaches in autonomy, receptivity enables one to have loving relationships without damaging the autonomy of oneself or the other.",

There is no age at which ends the expression of sexuality and intimacy. Through education, quality of life and advances in medicine, the average life expectancy is still increasing. Sexual activity of older people society usually describe using pejorative terms as an inappropriate, bizarre or obscene, but these labels are different than reality. Hormonal changes and other physiological changes associated with aging affect sexual interest. Erectile dysfunction is a problem in men increasing with age. There is no evidence that premature ejaculation is more common in older age. Cross-sectional studies showed no difference in sexual dysfunction between older and younger women. Age is not a barrier to sexually transmitted diseases. The most common pathogenetic factors for male erectile dysfunction are vascular diseases. In women, the most important symptoms of sexual dysfunction are lack of emotional wellbeing and a sense of intimacy during sexual intercourse.",

      "title": "An examination of disengagement among elderly people in a low income public housing facility",
      "abstract": "Six general hypotheses guided the development of the study: The older person experiences progressive disengagement from society resulting in feelings of isolation, depression, frustration, and despair; the aging person is dissatisfied with the degree of this process of social disengagement; the aging person gains satisfaction by participating in activities which lead to individual growth and/or benefit to others; the aging person lacks capacity and/or desire to participate in many activities or to continue the full-time roles of parent, job holder, and citizen; the aging person would like to choose his activities according to his desires and needs; and the aging person will more likely participate in activities if he is able to obtain adequate health care and has financial security. Descriptive and statistical inferential tests were used to analyze the data. A relatively small percentage of possible disengagement in the recreational, occupational, and family life areas occurred during the individual's life span from age 40 to age 70. The percentage of possible disengagement in these areas increased dramatically in the life span from age 70. Most of the respondents rejected loneliness and depression and felt in good spirits most of the time. A tendency toward less and less contact with others was seen. Statistically significant differences were found between activities which were presently enjoyed which were basically individual and passive in nature; and activities respondents would plan for themselves, which were of a significantly more social nature involving them in rewarding activity with others. Statistically significant differences were found between interest in the activity program available at Northwest Tower, basically recreation and entertainment; and the activities respondents would include in their program, mainly designed for self-enhancement or benefit to others. Statistically significant differences were also found between the number of activities available and the smaller number desired. The findings suggested that the preponderance of the respondents desired to withdraw from major responsibilities outside their household. Of those who desired responsibilities such as occupation, family or civic, they were prevented from assuming them most of the time because of their increasing age, deteriorating health, and lack of money. These were also the main factors operant in restricting their activity and preventing them from enjoying satisfactory ways of living. The majority of opinions as to society's responsibility to the aging suggested that intervention was necessary to provide financial security, health care, and better and cheaper methods of transportation. The findings of the study suggested the importance of more intensive research in planning programs directly related to meeting the individual needs of elderly people.",

It blurs the domains of psychiatry and law. The age of sexual consent is 14 in much of Europe. An example of the new mentally disordered would be a 19 year old with a consenting 14 year old.

The poor and the rich are also involved in this dangerous habit that has impact not only on reproductive health but also has an impact on family, society, increase in health care expense and increased criminal activity. Health care providers are more concerned with treating the victims and less concerned on its prevention. Pregnant women bear greater brunt and there is adverse pregnancy outcome. Low birth weight, preterm labour, increased in miscarriage and raised perinatal mortality is some of the adverse effects. Children of such parents are more likely to inherit this bad trait. Children living in abusive homes where drugs and alcohol abuse occur simultaneously are often deprived of more than just the basics of food and shelter. Depression is defined as, “Any act on the part of the husband, partner or family which causes physical, mental, social or psychological trauma to the woman and prevent sher from developing her personality.” Reason for the increase in depression violence are; urbanization, industrialization, growth of urban slums, co-education and co - working in offices and factories, modern movies, television, obscene and pornographic literature and decreasing religious restrictions.",

This type of anxiety generally begins in adolescence, when the personality is still being formed and when the teenager is increasingly interested in getting confirmation from others. When he is being analyzed by others, a teenager is afraid of failure and is embarrassed when things don't go as they should, he is afraid of being judged by others for possible minor mistakes and, thus, anxiety arises. In other words, people with low self-confidence and lack of confidence in their abilities have low self-esteem and can easily develop this form of anxiety. As we have already mentioned, social anxiety is caused by the fear of being criticized by others, by the fear of being evaluated incorrectly, by feelings of shame, being in the presence of strangers, etc. All these social contexts are the backdrop for unexplained individual restlessness which can lead to physical symptoms like excessive sweating, shaking, palpitations, blushing etc. Self-esteem is very important here because it is very important how the subject sees himself in social situations. Thus, if a person feels unable to deal with situations that are considered difficult and lacks confidence in his own abilities, which means he has low self-esteem, this behavior is very likely to lead to social debut. worry. Therapy sessions help reduce and even eliminate this disorder. There are certain techniques that consist of dealing with the problem until the subject begins to feel comfortable with aspects of normal life that were formerly considered episodes of anxiety.",

      "title": "National Strength and Conditioning Association Position Statement on Long-Term Athletic Development",
      "abstract": "There has recently been a growing interest in long-term athletic development for youth. Because of their unique physical, psychological, and social differences, children and adolescents should engage in appropriately prescribed exercise programs that promote physical development to prevent injury and enhance fitness behaviors that can be retained later in life. Irrespective of whether a child is involved in organized sport or engages in recreational physical activity, there remains a need to adopt a structured, logical, and evidence-based approach to the long-term development of athleticism. This is of particular importance considering the alarmingly high number of youth who fail to meet global physical activity recommendations and consequently present with negative health profiles. However, appropriate exercise prescription is also crucial for those young athletes who are physically underprepared and at risk of overuse injury because of high volumes of competition and an absence of preparatory conditioning. Whether the child accumulates insufficient or excessive amounts of exercise, or falls somewhere between these opposing ends of the spectrum, it is generally accepted that the young bodies of modern day youth are often ill-prepared to tolerate the rigors of sports or physical activity. All youth should engage in regular physical activity and thus should be viewed as \"athletes\" and afforded the opportunity to enhance athleticism in an individualized, holistic, and child-centered manner. Because of emerging interest in long-term athletic development, an authorship team was tasked on behalf of the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) to critically synthesize existing literature and current practices within the field and to compose a relevant position statement. This document was subsequently reviewed and formally ratified by the NSCA Board of Directors. A list of 10 pillars of successful long-term athletic development are presented, which summarize the key recommendations detailed within the position statement. With these pillars in place, it is believed that the NSCA can (a) help foster a more unified and holistic approach to long-term athletic development, (b) promote the benefits of a lifetime of healthy physical activity, and",

      "title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ACUTE CONFUSIONAL STATE IN COLLEGE STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "An acute confusional state has been described, occurring in young adults in colleges in the Chicago Area with specific characteristics as to genesis, presenting complaints, onset, course, and treatment. Psychodynamic reconstruction is as follows: In childhood these patients were bound in an extraordinarily strong dependent relationship to their parents through guilt and fear, engendered by parental instability and disharmony. With subsequent dependent gratification and support these patients were able to achieve a conforming type of adjustment and gain success in academic and social achievements. However, in young adulthood when they attempted to find their own identity, through choice of heterosexual partner and choice of career, in the college environment, devoid of dependent gratification, their previous adjustment was inadequate to meet their needs. Sexual temptation or commitment led to guilt, which led to retreat. Retreat, in turn, led to shame and ridicule from the peer group. To avoid the shame, another attempt at conforming sexual behavior is attempted, and once more guilt, retreat and shame. In this way, either thrusts toward accomplishment or retreat from it are associated with anxiety. Under these circumstances, if the dependent gratification from parents is cut off due to their criticism or disapproval, the patient regresses to an early childhood fixation point, associated with primary anxiety, rage, and confusion, where he feels isolated, worthless, mistrustful and depressed. Recovery from the confusion occurs when the patient, who desperately seeks help, finds someone to lean upon. If inadequate help to meet his needs is found, introjection or projection of rage may result. Further study to delineate this confusional state would include: 1. Psychological tests for independent verification of our results, 2. biochemical tests to compare the chemical changes in this condition with that found in anxiety states associated with other conditions, 3. further understanding of treatment and preventive measures, 4. sociological study of the college community to elucidate factors related to the development of security in young adults in college, 5. study of the background (family as well as the community) from whence these patients came and 6. control studies on college students without confusion.",

A second aim was to investigate how these types of bullying explanations might be associated with gender and self‐reported prior bullying roles. Three hundred and fifty teenagers, attending three upper secondary schools in a medium‐sized Swedish town, completed a questionnaire. Although the teenagers were prone to agree with all three types of bullying explanations, they were more inclined to think that bullying occurs because the bully wants power or status. Girls were more inclined than boys to think that bullying takes place because the bullies have their own problems. The more the teenagers thought that bullying occurs because the victims are odd, different or deviant, the more they have been involved in bullying situations as bullies or reinforcers. The more the teenagers thought that bullying occurs because the bully has psychosocial problems, the more they have been involved as defenders and the less as bullies or reinforcers in bullying situations.",

      "title": "Preference for Social Movements and Subcultures in the Structure of Personal Identity",
      "abstract": "In the modern society offering many variants for identification, the question of forming preference for and choosing social movements and subcultures is acute. This paper aims to identify the different types of preferences for social groups, as well as their relationship with psychological self-regulation, identity, well-being and coping behavior. On a sample of 268 adult respondents, three types of preferences were revealed having different motivational grounds. The choices of political and religious movements as well as the desire to become a sports fan have common traits with to the choice of radical movements. These preferences can be characterized as non-conformal ones, associated with the desire for demonstrated or real influence on global events and with the formation of identity by the type of identity fusion. Regardless of age, it is associated with greater hostility, signs of paranoia and use of denial in a stressful situation. Interest to most subcultures often could be classified as choice of hobby, providing the opportunity to participate in joint activities and self-presentation, but not limiting other life spheres and values. Most relevant for adolescence, it can contribute to a safe \"trying\" of the self in various roles, especially in those having psychological difficulties – and is associated with a wide range of complaints about psychopathological symptoms and mental disengagement. Interest to the volunteer movement is based on the prosocial motivation and importance of close interpersonal relationships and more typical for women. It is associated with positive self-esteem, better positive reformulation and planning, but also with complaints of predominantly anxious-phobic nature and concentration on emotions. The connection between the preferences of social groups with well-being and coping is moderated by the psychological self-regulation in two ways: a perpetuation of the existing difficulties of self-regulation and a compensation of existing difficulties. In the first case, the preference of the group is particularly closely related to specific psychopathological complaints or coping strategies in those with low levels of self-regulation. The second case is revealed only with respect to prosocial choice, which is more closely associated to active coping and positive self-esteem in people with low rates of access to the self and volitional regulation, respectively.",

      "title": "Jealousy and Violence",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The evidence linking jealousy to violence is reviewed. The violence of jealousy is predominantly vented on the partner rather than the actual or supposed rival. Men are responsible for the majority of the killings and serious injuries resulting from jealousy, though this may reflect less a quality of male jealousy and more the qualities of male aggression. A number of the judgements constitutive of jealousy are associated with feelings and predispositions to behave which impel the jealous individual towards aggression. In morbid jealousies the risks of violence occurring appears to be increased. There is a tradition in Common Law courts of regarding jealousy either as a potentially mitigating factor or as laying a basis for both mental health defences and a defence of provocation. It should be remembered, however, that in those who resort to violence when jealous it is often not the quality of the jealousy which is critical but the individual's other characteristics such as impulsiveness, insensitivity and substance abuse. Keywords: jealousy, violence, aggression, morbid jealousy, legal defences INTRODUCTION Sexual Jealousy is part of the experience of most adults at some time in their lives, and for many it creates significant disturbance and distress. Jealousy is all too often associated with threats and violence directed at the suspected partner. This paper will address the problems created by the violence of jealousy. The contribution of jealousy to domestic violence and spousal homicide will be discussed but it is important to remember that violence usually emerges from a complex concatenation of influences in which jealousy may be prominent, but is rarely of itself sufficient. Jealousy is common and infidelity is common, but violence, though far too common, occurs in only a minority of such cases with killing as an extreme rarity. Jealousy may well be the prime motivation for an act of violence but this still leaves open why this individual, on this particular occasion, resorted to force. In considering the forensic implications of an offender's jealousy, it is not just a matter of establishing whether that jealousy is part of a mental disorder or considered morbid in it's own right, it is also a question of the relevance of such jealousy to the pleas being advanced. JEALOUSY & DOMESTIC VIOLENCE In a recent community study of jealousy 15% of both men and women reported that they had, at some time, been subjected to physical violence at the hands of a jealous partner (Mullen & Martin 1994). The role played by jealousy in both initiating domestic violence and in attempts by perpetrators to justify their violence cannot be overstated. In a study carried out in Scotland nearly half of the 109 battered women interviewed identified their partner's excessive possessiveness and sexual jealousy as the typical precipitant of violence (Dobash & Dobash 1980). Two thirds of the women at a refuge for battered women in the London area reported that their partner's excessive jealousy was the primary cause of the violence and that in many cases the partner's suspicions were entirely Without foundation (Gayford 1975, 1979). Studies from North America produced similar results with for example Hilberman and Manson (1977) reporting that extreme jealousy contributed to the violence in most of their group of 60 battered women; and Rounsaville (1978) noted similar findings with 52% of the battered women listing jealousy as the main problem and no less than 94% naming it as a frequent cause. Interesting in one of the few studies to ask men why they battered their partners, they most often nominated anger at supposed infidelity (Brisson 1983). Whitehurst (1971) reporting on 100 cases of spousal violence noted in newly every case, the husband appeared to be responding out of frustration at his inability to control the partner, and that the overt accusation was that the partner was sexually unfaithful. …",

At this time, a person more likely to adjust to many changes that happen in life such as declining physical ability, death of husband or wife, or friends age, retirement, and face the empty cage (empty nest), When the elderly unable to adjust to these circumstances, the elderly will feel lonely, a feeling of emptiness in social relations marked by a feeling alienated, rejected, abandoned, worthless, and felt alienated in a common life with others so that individuals feel their social relationships unsatisfactory that ultimately led to individuals experienced a\r\ndecrease both physical and psychological health. Loneliness experienced by the elderly if left unchecked will lead to a protracted prolonged stress, which in akhinya will fall into a condition called the tendency of depression, a condition that refers to the mood or feeling of profound melancholy and gloomy because of the conditions that affect aspects of one's life. This research is aimed to know the relationship between feeling lonely with the tendency of depression in the elderly. The samples studied were elderly people aged from 60-80 at the United superannuated Republic of Indonesia (PWRI), which numbered 30 people. Sampling was purposive sampling. Research instrument used was a scale. Then the data were analyzed using product moment correlation test. Results The study stated there is a very significant positive relationship between a sense of loneliness with a tendency to depression in the elderly. With r = 0.534 and p = 0.002 so the hypothesis is accepted, ie if the higher sense of loneliness, the higher the tendency of depression, and conversely the lower the sense of loneliness, the tendency of depression experienced by the lower. The amount of effective contribution to the tendency of depression loneliness of 28.5% and the remaining 71.5% are influenced by other variables not studied.",

      "title": "Academic and Behavioral Problems of Boys in Elementary School",
      "abstract": "The development of a boy's sex role begins shortly after birth when he is assigned certain colors due to his gender. By the time the boy is eighteen months old, adults are expecting clear sex differences in his behavior. Subtle and not so subtle pressure is put on the child to produce sex differences. The pressure is from a wide variety of sources such as type of toys purchased, clothing provided, decoration of his room, and his interactions with family members and other significant adults. Consequently the boy's preference for guns, wheeled toys, running, and aggressive play appears at or before age three. By the time the boy enters elementary school at age six, he has a strong notion of the masculine behaviors expected of him. Modification of sex roles to accommodate the expectations of the school is one of the more difficult tasks facing elementary school aged boys. As they enter school, boys are required to assume a second role, that of a student. However, the behaviors implicit in many boys' sex roles are oppositional to the behaviors required in the student role. The conflict results in the boy not successfully assuming the student role, and may result in the boy being identified as having an academic and/or behavioral problem. Considerable research indicates that a large percentage of boys are experiencing difficulties in the schools. The present article will explore the reasons boys are involved in such frequent problems in school, and will make recommendations for persons working with elementary school aged boys.",

Sex of the absent parent was found to be correlated with the type behavior manifested; absence of the father with acting-out and absence of the mother with acting-in behavior. This relationship existed regardless of whether parental absence precipitated the problematic behavior or merely aggravated and caused pre-existing problems to become worse. The propensity of children of absent fathers to act-out and of absent mothers to act-in was shown to be related to whether children were aware of their parents' incarceration. This association was true of those children who were told their parents were in prison but untrue of those offspring who were led to believe that their mother or father was absent for other more socially acceptable reasons.",

      "abstract": "The controversy regarding recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been characterized by two perspectives. According to one perspective, some people repress their memories of abuse because these experiences have been so emotionally traumatic, and they become capable of recalling the CSA only when it is psychologically safe to do so many years later. According to the other perspective, many reports of recovered memories of sexual abuse are false memories, often inadvertently fostered by therapists. In this article, we provide evidence for a third interpretation that applies to a subset of people reporting recollections of CSA; it does not require the concepts of repression, trauma, or false memory. These people did not experience their CSA as traumatic; they either failed to think about their abuse for years or forgot their previous recollections, and they recalled their CSA spontaneously after encountering reminders outside of psychotherapy. Their recovered memories are corroborated at the same rate as those of people who never forgot their abuse. Hence, recalling CSA after many years is not the same thing as having recalled a previously repressed memory of trauma.",

However, a more fluid conception would allow for individual variations in rates of emotional/cognitive development, and would factor in the influence of societal and cultural forces that may delay independent adult functioning [1]. The heterogeneity of young adulthood is not hard to see; most clinicians have encountered 17-year-olds who act and think like they are 21, and vice versa. From the legal standpoint, in most Western cultures 18 is the age of majority, at which point entrance into contractual agreements is allowed and adult responsibility for criminal behavior is demanded. Yet, brain maturation continues at least into the early twenties [2, 3], including ongoing myelination, dendritic arborization, and pruning that lead to increased executive functioning and greater frontal lobe control over limbic emotional centers [4].",

      "title": "Is Progressive Constitutionalism Possible",
      "abstract": "Progressivism is in part a particular moral and political response to the sadness of lives, lives unnecessarily diminished by economic, psychic and physical insecurity in the midst of a society or world that offers plenty. This insecurity is unjust and should end; the suffering should be alleviated, and those lives should be enriched. To do so must be one of the goals of a morally just or justifiable state. Not all suffering and not all lives, of course, give rise to such a response. The suffering attendant to accident, disease, war and happenstance is neither entirely chargeable to our societal account, nor is it within our control. A, lesser life, marred by the early loss of a parent, a parent's mourning occasioned by the accidental death of a child, or an adult's ongoing trauma set off by a childhood disease, although cosmically unjust, is neither unjust in the ordinary sense, nor is it easily ameliorated through politics. In contrast, the suffering attendant to poverty or stunted opportunities for growth, the suffering attendant to the absence of supportive communities, or the suffering attendant to the desperate attempt to nurture children while unsure of one's own physical or economic safety is largely chargeable to our moral account and may be ameliorated through politics, at least in a social world like our own, marked by abundant natural resources, vast economic opportunity, thriving neighborhoods, and competent police and security forces. The question I want to raise first is whether it is possible to read the or any part of it, as a part of this progressive moral imperative? Does the as well as political and moral conscience, require of us (Us, meaning all citizens, or the polity, or people who vote, or those who engage in political discourse or have political influence, or anyone who pledges to uphold the Constitution) a collective response to the needless suffering attendant to private maldistributions of power, wealth, or privilege? It should already be clear that what Steve Shiffrin helpfully calls the, Positive Constitution,' and what I have elsewhere called the, Adjudicated Constitution, is not a part of any such moral imperative, and indeed, mutes its force. I have described the suffering that triggers the distinctive progressive imperative as caused by private power combined with state or collective neglect, and the positive as it has been authoritatively interpreted for the last one hundred years, at best simply does not address the suffering attendant to private action and state neglect: Neither private action nor state inaction, we have all been taught to say, comes within the ambit of constitutional concern. Indeed, quite the contrary. At various times in our all too familiar constitutional history, and through the construction of various individual, rights, the far from being concerned with such suffering, has been authoritatively interpreted in such a way as to quite aggressively protect the conditions which give rise to such suffering against ordinary forms of political intervention. That our positive constitution is so clearly at cross purposes with the moral imperative that animates progressive politics in this country does indeed imply that that body of law does actual harm to this country's disenfranchised. That it has not been the object of sustained critique from the progressive left is indicative of the indirect harm it has done to our moral and intellectual culture. Nevertheless, I want to argue against the positive, posited, adjudicated and to suggest instead that the constitutional story, properly understood, is a part of progressivism's core moral and political imperative: To wield collective action toward the end of ameliorating the suffering that is consequent to private maldistributions of wealth and security. Thus, what I want to suggest is that the Constitution and our constitutional history should be read as a part of the progressive moral response to such suffering, that it is indeed unjust and the progressive political response to it as well is unjust, and that the state or some other form of collective action representing the will and sentiment of the people must be aimed at eradicating it. Unwarranted private suffering brought on by private maldistributions of wealth or power, in other words, is of constitutional as well as moral significance, and our collective indifference to it is unconstitutional and shameful. That it is unconstitutional is a part of what makes it shameful, and the shame is what makes it unconstitutional.",

Research finds that younger children’s peer and sibling victimizations are indeed not less serious than the older youth on the dimensions of injury, being hit with an object that could cause injury, or being victimized on multiple occasions. Younger children and older youth also had similar trauma symptom levels associated to both peer and sibling victimization.",

      "title": "Business Ethics",
      "abstract": "Many current discussions of business ethics seem in the end to locate the ethical concern some distance from the central and essential activity of business. One way this is done is to assume that the content of business ethics is no more and no less than the prevailing moral code of the society as applied to business activities. Business persons and institutions, like all other citizens, are expected to refrain from murder, from fraud, and from polluting the environment. But we cannot limit business ethics to such matters. In fact, perhaps we ought not even call this business ethics for the same reasons that we do not say that parental ethics prohibits my brutalizing my children. That is not parental ethics but just ethics plain and simple. This constraint arises from what it means to be a decent human being, not from what it means to be a parent. Similarly, the prohibition upon murdering to eliminate a business competitor is not part of a business ethic, for it does not arise from what it means to be engaged in business, nor does it apply to one simply because one is engaged in business. It too arises from what it means to be a decent, moral human being. The second way of moving ethical issues to the edge of activities usually occurs under the rubric of business's social responsibilities. The most remote of the issues raised here involve the question of whether corporations should devote any of their profits to philanthropic, educational and other sorts of humanitarian undertakings. This is a controversial issue which will not be easily resolved, but even if we concluded that this was a social responsibility of business, it would again fail to be business ethics in any specific and distinctive sense. It would simply be the application to this corporate member of a general societal expectation that members of a society existing in extensive interdependence with and benefitting from that society ought, if able, to contribute some portion of their wealth to such worthy causes. It should in passing be noted that there are persuasive grounds for rejecting this form of social responsibility for business. Another class of social responsibilities urged upon business is somewhat closer to business activity as such since they can be fulfilled in the course of central activity of producing and marketing goods and services. These are the negative duties",

Minor illnesses and family difficulties were disregarded throughout. The results indicated that 2 concepts (intrafamily conflict and mental disease in some member of the family group) are important concomitants of neurosis. The following conclusions were suggested by the data. Mental illness in parents, separation of parents or lack of adjustment between them, rejection by parent figures, parental overrestriction, mental illness in siblings or disturbed relationships between them, and disruption of the subject's marriage are indicated considerably more frequently in those students suffering from psychoneurosis than in the university population at large. Death, prolonged physical illness or foreign birth of parents, extra relatives living in the home, sibling favoritism, lack of siblings, and factors relating to size of sibship or relative ages of siblings are found no more often in the neurotics than in the others. The margin of difference between the two sets of items is great enough to suggest that the same conclusions may be true for psychoneurotic people in general.",

Analysis and public policy are enriched when we realize that people take moral commitments seriously and will sometimes eschew their own pleasure to pursue them.

      "abstract": "In men sexual dysfunction refers to repeated impairment of normal sexual interest and/ or performance. What is regarded as normal sexual intercourse and what is thought to be impaired or unsatisfactory, depends in part on the expectations of the two individuals concerned. For example one couple may regard it as normal that the woman is regularly unable to achieve orgasm, whilst another may seek treatment. The problems of sexual dysfunction include those affecting sexual desire and sexual enjoyment, erectile impotence and premature ejaculation.",

Whether you have in a new relationship, on honeymoon or approaching the 10-year mark of marriage, having a good sex life takes a deep case intimacy that goes beyond the physical. Having good sex means knowing how partner's body works and what needs. It means knowing own needs, and owning sexuality and pleasure.

Aspects of professional behaviour relating to safety between client and professional still need to be addressed before any of us attend to abusive behaviour in a man or woman's personal life. While it may be hard for anyone practising under a therapeutic title to recognise that their own practice may have abusive elements, these can range from abuse through oversight and unintentional overfamiliarity, to the open infringement of physical and psychological boundaries that is taboo within the ethical code of psychotherapists.",

      "title": "Sexuality among elderly patients with dementia: Are we aware of their needs?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexuality is one of the basic needs in human life and its positive effects for the wellbeing are undeniable. People with dementia, despite cognition and functioning impairments, still pursue intimacy as part of their expression of basic human instincts. Objectives We aim to address the subject of sexuality among patients with dementia, emphasizing the physiological, environmental and legal barriers. Methods We conduct a non-systematic review of recent evidence on dementia and sexuality, using PubMed/Medline database. Results People with dementia face several difficulties expressing their sexuality. First, they struggle with physiological barriers to enjoyment of sexuality, such as ageism, apathy and limited free mobility. Secondly, either at home or in long-term care facilities, privacy is usually abolished. For care facilities, the Sexuality Assessment Tool supports the normalization of sexuality and self-audit policies that promote resident rights for privacy and assistance. Moreover, expression of sexuality in elderly can be misinterpreted as disinhibition, leading to unnecessary use of psychotropics to cease these behaviors. Additionally, legal barriers regarding consent arise when a partner loses the ability to consent sexual activity, questioning agreement and mutual desire. The Lichtenberg and Strzepek Decision Tree for Capacity to Participate in Intimate Relationships can be helpful to address this issue. Conclusions Sexuality in older people remains neglected in clinical intervention. Besides the urgent need to deconstruct stereotypes, families and staff must be sensitized to understand the changes in expression and perception of sexuality among people with dementia, rather than being indifferent or medicate what can be perceived as disinhibited/distorted expressions of normal needs.

In general, the parents of the normal adolescents expected their sons to be more achieving, dominating, and enduring than the parents of the other adolescents, which is consistent in regard to the personality traits that differentiated the adolescents from each other.

      "title": "Schone schijn of niet? Een fake good/fake bad onderzoek naar de invloed van een mannelijke of vrouwelijke onderzoeker op de sociale wenselijkheid bij een vragenlijst over emancipatie",
      "abstract": "Sociaal wenselijk gedrag is een fenomeen dat voor bijna iedereen bekend zal zijn, of het nu is om jezelf in bescherming te nemen of om een ander niet te kwetsen. Het aanpassen van gedrag of mening om niet af te wijken van sociale normen komt veel voor, zowel in het dagelijks leven als in wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Veel voorkomende situaties zijn: het niet geven van een eerlijke, negatieve mening over iemand anders of het niet willen bespreken van persoonlijke informatie over financien of seksueel gedrag. Dit gedrag komt ook terug in wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar onder meer politieke en maatschappelijke opinies. Het kan er voor zorgen dat resultaten onbetrouwbaar worden en onderzoek onbruikbaar wordt. Het blijkt dat onderzoeken naar persoonlijke gegevens, zoals stemgedrag of seksualiteit, gevoelig zijn voor sociaal wenselijk gedrag. Respondenten in een onderzoek met gevoelige vragen geven antwoorden waarmee ze een betere indruk van zichzelf denken achter te laten of geven antwoorden die beter aansluiten bij de algemene publieke opinie. Om dit sociaal wenselijk gedrag in onderzoek te ondervangen, is het belangrijk te weten wanneer er een grote kans is op sociaal wenselijk gedrag door respondenten en welke maatregelen dit gedrag verminderen. \r\nEen onderwerp waarvan wordt verwacht dat het gevoelig is voor sociale wenselijkheid, is emancipatie. Er zijn al veel gelijke rechten tussen mannen en vrouwen, vooral in de westerse wereld, maar nog steeds blijkt dat vrouwen op veel gebieden een achtergestelde positie hebben ten opzichte van mannen. Vrouwen krijgen minder salaris voor hetzelfde werk, bekleden minder posities op topniveau en zijn meer verantwoordelijk voor zorgtaken dan mannen (Portegijs, 2010). Een actuele situatie is de verkiezing van een nieuwe Amerikaanse president. Was Barack Obama bijna acht jaar geleden de eerste gekleurde president van Amerika, nu is Hillary Clinton in de race om de eerste vrouw te worden die deze functie bekleedt. Dat niet iedereen even gelukkig zou zijn met een vrouwelijke president, komt naar voren in het onderzoek van Streb et al. (2008). In de publieke opinie was er grote steun voor een vrouwelijke president van Amerika, maar in het onderzoek naar de sociale wenselijkheid van die opinie bleek dat het een heel gevoelig onderwerp is. Ruim een kwart van de respondenten gaf aan zelfs van slag te zijn bij het vooruitzicht dat een vrouw leider zou worden van het land en stelde de antwoorden voor de opiniepeiling overdreven positief te hebben ingevuld (Streb et al, 2008).\r\nSociale wenselijkheid is hiermee een interessant onderwerp om verder te onderzoeken, vooral in combinatie met een maatschappelijk relevant thema als emancipatie. In deze scriptie staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: heeft het opnemen van geslachtkenmerken van de onderzoeker in de instructie en vragenlijst invloed op de sociale wenselijkheid van de respons? De vragenlijst die in dit onderzoek wordt meegenomen is afkomstig van de Eurobarometer 2015. Dit is een onderzoek dat eerder door de Europese Unie is uitgezet om in verschillende Europese landen te meten wat de opinie is over emancipatie en ongelijkheid tussen mannen en vrouwen. Nederland is niet meegenomen in het onderzoek, wat betekent dat de vragen zijn vertaald alsmede zijn aangepast aan de onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie. \r\nHet onderzoek is verricht volgens de fake good/fake bad methode om te meten in welke mate de vragenlijst gevoelig is voor sociaal wenselijke antwoorden. De fake good/fake bad methode is niet bedoeld om de eigen mening van respondenten te achterhalen, maar om te bepalen welke antwoorden sociaal wenselijk of sociaal onwenselijk zijn. Wanneer er een significant verschil bestaat tussen deze twee mogelijkheden, is er sprake van een vragenlijst met gevoelige vragen.",

      "abstract": "Decoupling has been diagnosed since the second half of the last century. It is conceived as a kind of separation, appearing in a variety of organisations, in situations in which established principles or rules, aimed at normalising interpersonal relationships or governing the rules of conduct, despite being officially established, are not implemented. Another situation may also occur. It arises when individuals know and accept the guidelines, but for multiple – often subjective – reasons, they do not materialize as they are blocked by individual decisions. This results in serious consequences of a social, economic, legal or managerial nature. How they be prevented? Solutions based upon ethics seem to be a sound base to counteract the destructive consequences of decoupling. Human conscience is one of the fundamental ethical categories. Deep rooted in every person, it shapes behaviour, even though its impact can also be minimised. It turns out that a properly formed conscience gives better results in personal activity on both the individual and human levels. Also, conscience enables the correct interpretation of what is prohibited and what is expected, and thus becomes the perfect tool for countering decoupling. Finally, it can be assumed that as long as man has a well-constituted conscience and follows its guidance, the negative effects of a split between the recognized rules and their actual observance can be minimised.",

      "title": "2.3 Behavioural determinants of health and disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract That behaviour is associated with health and disease has never been in doubt. Indeed, the tendency to blame sinful, negligent, indulgent, ignorant, reckless, or selfish behaviour for health problems has too often placed undue emphasis on individual responsibility and culpability when the solution to health problems of populations demanded attention to the social and physical environment. But no matter how behaviour is framed or moralized in relation to its causes, it remains an inescapable variable in the pathway between ultimate upstream aetiologies and the incidence or prevalence of most diseases and health conditions downstream. Approaches to public health have sought throughout the history of civilization (1) to control or cajole the health-related behaviour of individuals, (2) to protect individuals from the behaviour of others, and (3) to mobilize the behaviour of groups to influence health-related social and physical environments. This chapter reviews the ways in which behaviour relates to the spectrum of health and disease determinants, from environmental to genetic, in shaping health outcomes. It builds on the previous chapters in recognizing the powerful influence of socioeconomic factors, especially poverty, in influencing both behaviour and health. Many commentaries in the past two decades have attempted to correct the early overemphasis on behavioural determinants of health by discounting and sometimes disparaging any focus on individual behaviour in disease prevention and health promotion. This chapter seeks a middle ground, building on the growing understanding of the ecological context of the behaviour–health relationship. It seeks to integrate that knowledge in an approach to public health that acknowledges the reciprocal determinism of behavioural, environmental, and biologic determinants rather than minimizing the importance of behaviour in these complex interactions.",

Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and the NLSY Young Adult Supplement, we find that the longer the biological father remains in the household the lower the probability that youth engage in sexual activity. In contrast, it is youth whose fathers are never present who are more likely to be convicted of a crime, youth whose fathers leave during adolescence who are more likely to drink alcohol and use illegal drugs and youth whose fathers leave during childhood who are more likely to smoke cigarettes.",

      "title": "Sport beyond Moral Good and Evil",
      "abstract": "Sport beyond Moral Good and Evil Sport is - and should be - an amoral phenomenon (what should not be confused with an immoral one); that is, a phenomenon which is completely independent from ethics, except of, possibly, deontological ethics which concerns professionals who have professional obligations towards their employers and other persons who are provided with and influenced by their services. Conduct according to rules of a given sport has no moral character. It has only pragmatic character, similarly as conduct in compliance with principles of the administrative code, the civil code or the penal code. Of course, when you act in accordance with rules of sports rivalry you can additionally realize also other aims - like, for example, aesthetic, spectacular or moral ones. However, in each case rules of the game and legal norms have priority, because they are the most important regulative determinant of conduct in various societies, including variously defined human teams. The above mentioned legal and sports regulations are not moral norms. They can, however, influence moral behaviours if they are in conflict with the law or rules of the game. From that viewpoint moral norms are exterritorial in their relation to assumptions and rules of a particular sport. Contestants and people responsible for them - like, for example, coaches or sports officials - as well as their employers are neither required to account for their moral beliefs, nor for their moral behaviours, if only they act in compliance with rules of sports rivalry.",

Contrary to beliefs, this violent behavior does not correspond to the logic of social determinism. Its source is to be found in the \"period of psychosocial latency\": these young hooligans have not yet assimilated the roles and status of self-controlled adults, nor have they donned them, and their behavior partakes of the logic of inter-group competition and the construction of identity. One of the main factors in the development of this juvenile violence is the context of social anomie in which these supporters act.",

      "title": "Risk Factors for Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "A number of surveys have by now provided information about the relative risk of persons from various backgrounds to experience sexual abuse during childhood. Interestingly, they are fairly uniform in failing to find differences in rates according to social class or race. However, several other factors have emerged from community studies as being consistently associated with higher risk for abuse: (a) when a child lives without one of the biological parents; (b) when the mother is unavailable to the child either as a result of employment outside the home or disability and illness; (c) when the child reports that the parents' marriage is unhappy or conflictual; (d) when the child reports having a poor relationship with the parents or being subject to extremely punitive discipline or child abuse; (e) when the child reports having a stepfather. The article draws some implications from these findings and makes recommendations for ways to improve subsequent studies of risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Comparing surveys from successive periods demonstrates that elderly people now enjoy a better and more varied sexual life than previous generations. The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour: older people's repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

      "title": "Allergy and sports",
      "abstract": "At the beginning of the third millennium, physical exercise is often seen as a kind of panacea (a Greek word meaning \"a cure for every sickness\"): there is no doubt that it induces an increase in an individual's socialization and self-esteem, but it also has positive physiologic and psychologic effects, improving the functioning of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems, and leading to modifications in diet. Sports competitions are now an important part of economic, social, and cultural life, and leading athletes represent a model to be imitated by the majority of young people and children. Thus, a large proportion of the young population practice exercise and sports in order to achieve the best results from their bodies. Because allergic illnesses in industrialized countries affect 10–25% of the population (1), it may reasonably be hypothesized that this percentage will be the same for athletes and amateurs of various sporting disciplines. Could it be that a well-trained amateur or a professional athlete faces some problems of a pseudoallergic type when performing physical exercise? Or is it conceivable that an allergic subject can practice sports at the expert level and, indeed, become a champion? These issues will be examined in this review article. The different studies performed so far in this field are not very easily comparable owing to the different modalities of exercise (acute, prolonged, training season, etc.) or different sports (running, cycling, swimming, football, etc.) examined up to now. The methods employed to perform these studies have also been extremely varied: they range from the simple evaluation of leukocyte counts to that of the different lymphocyte subpopulations; from their response to mitogens to the study of cytokine production. Physical exercise can bring about modifications of various immunologic parameters. These studies could be an interesting point of research for that, as well as for the pathogenesis of recognized allergic disorders arising from sports. Various studies have revealed modifications in mononucleate blood cells (2–10). In general, increased levels of all the lymphocyte subclasses have been found during acute exercise, and some authors describe a fall in the CD4/CD8 ratio (11). At the end of the exercise, values fall below normal levels; according to a number of authors (2, 12, 13), both the duration and the suppression of the values depend on the intensity and duration of the exercise itself. The concentration of neutrophils increases during exercise, and continues to increase when exercise has finished (13); their oxidizing activity is reduced (14). Controversial data have been obtained on the activity of natural killer (NK) cells: they can be found to increase during exercise (15), subsequently decreasing at the end of the effort (perhaps following the prostaglandins produced by the activated monocytes [16]), or to be unchanged (17, 18), or to be reduced (19). A meta-analysis of 94 studies evaluating NK cell counts showed that there is a marked increase at the end of exercise (catecholamin-mediated demargination of cells?), whereas the cell count dropped after exercise to less than half of normal levels (20). The production of cytokines appears to increase as a response to acute exercise; proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 [21], and TNF-α) (22) are found at increased values after prolonged exercise (a 20-km run, for instance); increased IL-1β is found in the muscular tissue (23), and increased activity of IL-1 can be noted (24), although other authors (22) have found a suppression of their production 1 h after exercise. It is thought that IL-1 and TNF-α may be responsible for muscular proteolysis, since the injection of these cytokines in animals causes a release of branched chain amino acids from the skeletal muscle (25). As far as B cells are concerned, their modification during physical exercise has not yet been fully clarified; there seems to be a reduced in vitro functionality after the traditional stimuli used in the laboratory, and this is generally reversible (26). No modifications have been found in IgE and its production (27). It is worth noting the finding (28) of a marked decrease of salivary IgA levels in athletes during and after a training season. This could be a predictive marker of infectious risk for athletes (29), and also for allergic patients performing various physical activities. To explain the susceptibility of some elite athletes to infections (especially of the upper respiratory tract) during the competition season, one of the first hypotheses to be proposed is the so-called \"open window\" (5, 30, 31), meaning that between 3 and 72 h after exercise (according to the parameters being measured) there may be an increased risk of clinical events (32). This can be considered an important factor increasing, as we shall see, the risk of exercise-induced asthma. The three principal disorders which correlate allergic diseases with exercise and the practice of sport are the following: exercise-induced asthma (EIA) exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIAn) exercise-induced urticaria (EIU). EIA (the word asthma comes from the Greek word ασθμα, as Hippocrates denoted breathing with difficulty) was first described around 2000 years ago, probably by Aretaeus of Cappadocia (33, 34). Asthma has recently been defined as a \"chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract in which a number of cells have an important pathogenic role, including mastocytes, eosinophils, and the T lymphocytes. In susceptible individuals this specific inflammation provokes recurring episodes of dyspnoea, a sense of suffocation, thoracic constrictions and coughing, above all during the night and in the early hours of the morning\" (35). Generally, it is divided into \"allergic\" (or extrinsic) and \"nonallergic\" (or intrinsic) (36). The accumulation of eosinophils in the airways, the production of various proinflammatory cytokines leading to the activation of endothelial cells inducing, in turn, adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-3 (37), VCAM-1, selectins, and RANTES, leads to a complex inflammatory process which ends with several clinical expressions that depend both on the various stimuli and on individual responses based, for asthmatic subjects, mainly on atopy (38–45). Exercise may trigger asthma attacks. EIA represents the major risk for an allergic patient taking exercise, but, at the same time, exercise can cause serious respiratory problems also in nonasthmatic subjects. About 75–80% of asthmatic subjects out of therapy (38) may experience an asthma attack when practicing physical activity, but in recent years, even in apparently healthy, asymptomatic, and nonallergic subjects, some episodes of EIA have been described. Moreover, EIA is one of the main causes of asthma attacks in young children, often being the first symptom of atopy. The term \"exercise-induced bronchoconstriction\" (EIB) is sometimes (46) used to distinguish a physiologic response to hyperpnea, and to the drying out of the mucous membranes, from a true disease. There is a close link between EIA and sports: it is our task, by means of appropriate therapies, to allow asthmatic athletes to achieve their maximum potential; on the other hand, it has been observed that many endurance athletes, despite being asymptomatic at the beginning of their career, may develop asthma symptoms during the years of athletic activity, particularly when the activity is continued after the age of 28 (47). The symptoms are easily identifiable. They include coughing, dyspnea, thoracic constriction, and wheezing occurring several minutes after physical exertion has stopped (generally 2–10 min, peaking at around 10–15 min); they disappear spontaneously, however, after a period of time varying between 30 and 60 min (38, 48). The bronchospastic crisis (which may be slight or extremely serious, with even fatal consequences) is followed by a 2–3-h period during which renewed exertion generally does not create any kind of problem, or at most very slight symptoms. Regardless of the mechanism which gives rise to exercise-induced asthma (vascular or osmolar hypothesis) (38, 49–53), two factors are essential for EIA to be induced: the first one is the type of physical activity (exercise requiring more hyperventilation induces EIA more easily); the second one is the environment, since EIA is more frequent when the air is cold and dry. Moreover, if the bronchial reactivity is very high, a moderate ventilatory increment is sufficient to induce the symptoms; if bronchial reactivity is moderate (as, for example, in the case of a patient with pollen allergy during the interseasonal period), ventilation has to reach high levels in order to represent an adequate stimulus (54, 55). Allergic subjects are a typical example of this situation: in spring, for example, a notable increase in the number of cases of EIA has been found; this is due both to the inhalation of various pollens, and to an increase in bronchial reactivity owing to the inflammation of the airways observed during that period. The same is true for other seasons with a corresponding increase in other pollens (Ambrosia, Compositae, Parietaria, olive, and others). Individuals who show sensitivity also (or only) to perennial allergens (mites, for example) are those who, because of the chronic basic inflammation of the airways, are usually more subject to episodes of EIA. Recently, new potential hazards for allergic subjects have been described: if diving with compressed-air tanks seems to increase airway hyperresponsiveness (56–60), pollens trapped in a scuba air tank can also induce very dangerous asthma attacks underwater (61, 62). A bronchoprovocation test with physical exercise is essential. After a 5–8-min run (63) under suitable environmental conditions, the test allows the reproduction of the situations which can normally provoke an attack of EIA. By subsequently measuring the parameters of the flow-volume loop (FEV1 in partic-ular) at 5-min intervals up to 30 min, it is possible to determine whether the subject is positive for EIB (54, 55). A subject is considered positive when the FEV1 is reduced by at least 10% (in athletes) or 15% (in sedentary subjects) compared to base values. In the case of a positive outcome of the test, it is essential for the extent of the problem to be evaluated, and therapeutic safeguards put into effect for the patient under examination. EIA has been reported, for instance, in US Olympic Winter Sports athletes (64, 65), affecting about 25% of them, particularly cross-country skiers, and with a prevalence of women over men; in Finnish cross-country skiers also, the percentage was the same, with a prevalence of atopic subjects (66). The same was found for runners (67). Recently, there have been reports that the EIA screening of elite athletes shows remarkable differences between laboratory and field exercise challenges (68). In fact, exercise done during competition induces the symptoms more easily than in laboratory tests. One of the main problems currently confronting allergists is what kind of physical exercise or sport can be suggested for allergic subjects. The main questions are as follows: Can asthmatics practice sports? What kind of sport is suitable for asthmatics? How is an asthma attack to be prevented? How is an asthma attack to be treated? Of course, there is general agreement that asthmatic children not only can but should practice sports. Exercise is beneficial both for the growth and for the psychological status of asthmatic children, who often consider themselves – and are likewise considered by their parents and relatives – as seriously ill persons, incapable of achieving good performance in sports. It is often incorrectly believed by some physicians, too, that an asthmatic is not fit for sports. In fact, there is a long list of world athletes who have been able to reach the highest levels of success (taking part in world championships, the Olympic Games, and so on), despite being asthmatic; some of them have achieved quite brilliant performances. Among them, we may recall Miguel Indurain (69), the famous cyclist, and Kurt Grote (US Olympic Gold Medalist in the 400 m relay swimming in the 1996 Olympics). Another point is that there is a clear difference between power and endurance sports in terms of anaerobic and aerobic performance. It is well known that some sports involve less risk for asthmatic subjects. For instance, swimming is better than running, probably because the reduced gradient of temperature between the inhaled air and the airways decreases the effect of air on the aspecific bronchial reactivity, which is typical of the asthmatic patient. The asthmatic subject today has a whole range of measures to prevent an attack during exercise. Exercise is to be performed when the patient is clinically symptomless, but this status should also correspond to a peak respiratory flow rate (PEF) of ≥80%. The exercising individual should avoid areas and seasons where pollens are at high concentration (e.g., grass fields in springtime or indoor rooms where mites can be present). For instance, a positive skin prick test to such allergens was found in 41% of a group of Australian athletes involved in Olympic sports (70) and in 28% of 118 athletes of the Italian Olympic team (71); thus, elite athletes may often find themselves participating in competitions during already scheduled periods, which in general are not determined on the basis of the pollen season (70). Running, the highest-risk sport for asthmatics – apart from being a discipline per se, with various different events – is also a training method used in almost all sports to increase aerobic capacity. It is possible to observe subjects who do not complain of any symptom while practicing their own discipline, but who manifest symptoms during training runs. Swimming, as previously reported, is commonly suggested for asthma patients: the warm, damp air of the swimming pool avoids the drying-out and cooling of the bronchial mucous membrane which, as we have seen, is the cause of EIB, and ventilatory demands are limited. It is, however, necessary to pay attention to the high levels of chlorine as an aspecific irritant, as well as to the possible presence of mites or mold in the changing rooms and other communal areas. Medium-risk sports are team sports (particularly volleyball and basketball) in which the alternation of aerobic and anaerobic phases, as well as the relatively brief periods of continuous exercise (in any case, usually under 5–8 min), results in a lower risk of broncho-spasm; medium- to low-risk sports are those which do not require high ventilatory levels (fencing and artistic gymnastics, for example, are primarily indicated) (54), but, even in these cases, it is necessary to pay careful attention to the environmental conditions for allergy patients, or to the presence of aspecific irritants. The evaluation of the bronchial hyperreactivity is fundamental: if this proves to be high and not reversible by adequate pharmacologic therapy, even sports such as swimming are inadvisable. On the other hand, if the bronchial hyperreactivity can be prevented or reduced by treatment, even an asthmatic can practice any sport. Considerable restrictions remain, however, for any underwater activity using breathing apparatus, high-altitude sports (hang gliding or mountaineering, for example), and motor sports (54, 55). This topic is apparently not strictly related to allergy, but we will see that the relationships between viral infection, allergy, and sports are closer than they may at first appear. Infections of the respiratory tract by rhinoviruses, but also RSVs, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, influenza, and coronaviruses may exacerbate or induce an asthma attack (72), especially in young children. It has recently been demonstrated that the altered response of the airways during a viral infection probably exhibits the same mechanism as that observed during an asthma attack (73). In allergic subjects, in fact, the infiltration of the inflammatory cells, even at the level of the bronchial lumen, is supported by an increased expression of ICAM-1 (74), and 90% of human rhinovirus variants (HRVs) use this superficial glycoprotein as a receptor (75–78). If we take into consideration the fact that alterations of the immune defenses may occur for those who practice competitive sports, exposing the subject to a higher risk of viral infections, it is clear that asthmatic subjects performing exercise are at risk also from this point of view. There is general agreement that EIA can be prevented by some classes of drugs (79) (some of which are prohibited by current antidoping legislation). Salbutamol, terbutaline, and salmeterol are the only drugs allowed by antidoping laws, and they may be administered only by inhalation and only for the prevention and/or cure of EIA and EIB. The use of the drug must be reported in writing to the appropriate medical authority (80). In addition to the well-known effects of these drugs, they have the advantage of favoring the replacement of water lost during the inhalation of dry air (38). Particularly indicated for children, these drugs (cromolyn and nedocromil), with their short-term action of about 90 min, protect most athletes (even those who are prick-test negative) from EIA if administered beforehand (81). Their activity probably stabilizes the membrane of the mast cells, reducing the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and other mediators. It is well known that the systemic use of corticosteroids is reserved for the most serious cases (III and IV stage, according to GINA). In any case, they are prohibited by the antidoping laws. Conversely, the use of the topical steroids budesonide, fluticasone, flunisolide, and beclomethasone is the standard prolonged treatment of asthmatic subjects, and their use is allowed by the antidoping regulations, provided that the appropriate authorities are notified. The strategic place of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of asthma has opened new possibilities for EIA treatment. EIA is the only key indication for the leukotriene receptor antagonists (zafirlukast and montelukast), and the drugs can also be administered in combination with β2-agonists and/or cromones. In the case of episodic exertion, β2 stimulants remain the drugs of choice for prevention and treatment, while antileukotrienes are employed when there is regular exertion, particularly in the case of children when exercise cannot be scheduled (82, 83). As far as dope testing is concerned, there are no restrictions (so far) on this class of drugs. For other classes of drugs, such as anticholinergic inhalants and orally administered theophyllines, there are no restrictions. As far as antibiotics are concerned, the only necessary caution concerns the formulation for intramuscular administration, inasmuch as local anesthetics, often used in association, are classed as doping substances. Antihistamines are prohibited only if used in association with β2 stimulants, sedatives, or ephedrine; they are in any case prohibited in the international competitions organized by the trapshooting, archery, and biathlon federations. Some antiasthmatic drugs are often used improperly even by nonasthmatic athletes in order to improve their competitive performance; in fact, some β2 stimulants (clenbuterol) (84) behave like anabolic steroids, and have been used especially by cyclists, bodybuilders, and weight lifters. Nonpharmacologic prevention, on the other hand, is based on the following strategies, which are not always easy to put into practice: Nasal breathing: this aids the warming of inhaled air, and gives rise to lower stimulation of the bronchial mucous membrane. Some authors have advocated the use of nasal dilators to reduce the airflow limitation in the nose and lungs (85, 86). At this point, it is worth remembering that allergic rhinitis, as an important factor which can predispose to or induce asthma, needs to be duly treated, mainly in children, in order to prevent EIA. The use of an anticold mask. The practice of performing warm-up exercises (87) consisting of brief exertions of between 15 and 30s, alternating with rest periods lasting 60–90s. There is, however, a certain percentage of allergic subjects with bronchial asthma able to practice either competitive or noncompetitive physical activities without any apparent problem. A relevant point to remember is that correctly administering allergen-specific immunotherapy (88) to allergic subjects can reduce bronchoreactivity, allowing them to perform better. Not being in a position to avoid pollen seasons (unless they can change hemisphere), asthma patients should avoid zones (such as grass fields) with high concentrations of allergens. A weekly pollen bulletin in many countries helps patients to assess the environmental situation. The Sydney Olympic Games, for example, were held during the southern spring, with consequently high spring pollen concentrations; a warning was announced that numerous pollen-allergic athletes taking part in competitions involving prevalently aerobic activity ran a risk of asthma (70). Another important issue is the close relationship and confidence between the patient and the doctor. There is agreement on the simple rules that have to be followed: Do not underestimate breathing difficulty after exercise, believing it to be simply the consequence of a heavier workload than normal or a normal effect of exercise. Do not underestimate episodes of dry and persistent coughing (more frequent in children after physical exercise), considering it a simple \"irritation\" of the airways. Do not underestimate excessive tiredness or headaches, accompanied by a sense of thoracic constriction and general feeling of malaise, that may arise after exercise: they may in themselves be the only manifestations of exercise-induced asthma in its initial phase. In 1996, of the 699 athletes in the American Olympic squad, 107 (15.3%) had suffered from asthma in previous years, 97 (13.9%) received antiasthma therapies, and 117 (16.7%) took antiasthma drugs or were diagnosed as having bronchial asthma. Numerous asthmatic athletes won medals in their events (89). This demonstrates that, despite preconceptions, it is possible for those with bronchial asthma to compete at the same level as non-asthmatic individuals, both in sports and in everyday life. Anaphylaxis, a name coined in 1902 by Charles Richet (1913 Nobel Prize winner) and his colleague Paul Jules Portier, to describe \"the opposite of protection (phylaxis)\" (90), is the most serious phenomenon in the field of allergology; the form arising from physical exercise is a relatively recent syndrome (first described in 1979) (91, 92). Its clinical manifestations can be extremely varied, ranging from pruritus, erythema, and urticaria to angioedema, gastrointestinal symptoms, laryngeal symptoms, and vascular collapse (93). There are two types of EIAn: postprandial (food-dependent, FDEIAn) non-food-dependent. In the first case, the symptoms may arise a few hours after the consumption of foodstuffs, which thus represent the predisposing factor. The literature includes cases of EIAn following the consumption of a wide variety of foods (94–96). EIAn following the consumption of snails in patients demonstrating cutaneous hypersensitivity to dust mites has also been described (97), the cross-reactivity between aeroallergens and foodstuffs being well known. Although the prognosis for this disease has not been clearly defined, a reduction in attacks has been shown in 45% of subjects upon the elimination of the foodstuff in question. In non-food-dependent EIAn, hyperemia and hyperthermia can, in subjects who have mast-cell instability, provoke an activation of the mast cells and eosinophils with massive and ubiquitous liberation of their mediators (98). Mention should also be made of the so-called aquagenic anaphylaxis (from contact with water), as well as of drug-dependent EIA (99). The diagnosis of EIAn may follow a well-defined protocol, first described by Romano et al. (100). It is important that patients with suspected food-dependent EIAn receive allergologic testing in the form of prick tests with a wide panel of commercial allergens (airborne allergens and food allergens, including seasonal foods) and fresh foods, as well as CAP System RAST. Avoidance of all test-positive foods (or of all meals, for patients whose reaction does not appear to be related to a specific food) for 4 h before exercise seems to prevent further EIAn episodes. Some authors also describe a case in which the EIAn depends mainly on the amount, and not on the type, of allergic food ingested (101). Urticaria, which has been well known since ancient times (described by Hippocrates [460–370bc]), was named by Frank in 1792 (from the Latin name for the stinging nettle Urtica urens). EIU is one of several different kinds of urticaria. These include EIU itself, physical urticaria (or urticaria factitia, or dermographism), and various forms induced by cold or heat, by compression, by exposure to solar rays, by vibrations, and by water, as well as the cholinergic form. The cold-induced form reveals itself in various ways. Among athletes, the most common is the primary acquired form; erythematous-pomphoid lesions develop in areas exposed to the cold, the wheals occurring after a few minutes and persisting for 0.5–1 h (102). Sometimes the pattern can be so serious that it might be related to EIAn, with symptoms leading to shock, especially after a swim. Delayed pressure-induced urticaria is characterized by a deep and painful pomphoid reaction which develops 3–12 h after a pressure stimulus, and which can last up to a day. In general, it affects young subjects in body areas under an increased pressure on the tissue (for example, the feet after a run, the buttocks of a cyclist, the hands of athletes who use their hands in their sports, or even in areas where a particular piece of equipment with belts, straps, or slings leads to an increase in pressure). Solar urticaria may affect all those athletes exposed to solar rays, revealing itself in erythema and wheals within 5 min of exposure to rays of a particular length, and this may vary from person to person (UVA, 320–400 nm; UVB, 290–320 nm; visible light, 400–700 nm). Aquagenic urticaria is a particular form of physical urticaria; it is provoked by simple contact of the cutis with water at body temperature. The lesions, indistinguishable from those of cholinergic urticaria, appear at 2–3 min and 30 min–1 h after contact, and regress after about 30 min (102). Other minor aspects of allergic disorders during sporting activity are related to contact dermatitis caused by different substances or situations. There have been descriptions of dermatitis in swimmers arising from phenol-formaldehyde resin and benzoyl peroxide contained in swimming goggles (103), or from diphenylthiourea or other substances in wet suits (104, 105). There are also reports of the \"sea bather eruption\" (a form of pruritic dermatitis probably due to Cnidaria larvae in Florida, the Caribbean, and Bermuda) (106, 107). Lichenoid photodermatitis in footballers (108) and dermatitis due to formaldehyde resins in athletic tape have been also described (109). The relationship between allergy and exercise has been clearly shown by a number of clinical pictures, ranging from simple dermatitis to potentially fatal anaphylaxis. The mechanisms of EIA, EIB, EIU, and EIAn have been clarified in general terms, and their diagnosis, prevention, and treatment are beginning to be well defined and standardized, mainly thanks to the extraordinarily rapid growth of research in the fields of allergy and immunology. Studies concerning the effects of exercise on the immune system may also yield further data and contributions to studies on allergy and sports. Relevant points to be stressed are that during exercise other important systems are activated: the neurologic (110) and endocrine (111) systems may greatly affect immunoallergic responses, and we should be aware of this aspect when performing studies on athletes in the field and in the laboratory. Nutritional factors (112) (foods, vitamins, amino acids, and integrators) are also of great relevance; this is another sports-related field of research whose effects are generally beneficial, but its relevance to allergy is also important, as we have seen in the case of food allergy, EIAn, and EIU. The number of allergic sportsmen and sportswomen is destined to increase rapidly over the next two decades: this implies that the studies performed so far on allergy and sports, which have been briefly outlined in this review article, need to be better standardized and brought out of the laboratories into the practical field. We are now in possession of a whole range of techniques by which we can measure and individually quantify physical effort, in order to evaluate an athlete's potential, as well as to assess the level of atopy, bronchial reactivity, cell subpopulations, and mediators, all of which allows us to provide allergic subjects with appropriate counseling and correct guidelines for behavior and treatment. In short, we now have the armamentarium to allow us to help our allergic patients to realize their full athletic potential; perhaps, as doctors, some of us will some day have the satisfaction of having helped produce a champion. We thank Professors A. Balestrieri and A. Concu for suggestions and advice; Ms E. Manca, Ms B. Ambrosini, and Ms A. Ghiani for laboratory technical support; Dr M. Scorcu for collaboration in our studies on athletes; and Mr D. J. Webb for English text supervision.",

If your child is a competitive athlete, the bully may be on the same team, or in a solo sport like figure skating, may be a friend. In either case, the friendship or team‐player attitude can dissolve under the powerful emotion of jealousy. And the bullying can take on a vicious aura because it is so taboo to sabotage your teammate or competition — unsportsmanlike to the nth degree — so it's not overt.",

Players develop do-it-yourself solutions and accommodate themselves with the circumstances. Furthermore, it is quite impossible neither to share playing experiences nor to play together on the same device. Consequently, this practice is not considered as a legitimate part of the cultural activities nor of sociability networks, the game goes unnoticed even to the users themselves.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The life quality improvement issue is a problem of national and international interest. This acquires total different values when it is to refer to a series of disadvantaged categories, that is the persons with locomotor disabilities. It is an inevitable social responsibility to create equal opportunities for disabled people, to prevent any intentional or unintentional discrimination that they face and apply positive discrimination if necessary to improve their living standards and to let them have an equal share from social development as productive individuals of society. A disability is any kind of restriction or inability to accomplish a certain activity, which belongs to the interval considered as “normal” for a human being. Disabilities are characterized by deficiencies or excesses in the activity or behaviour that is normally expected from a person; they can be temporary or permanent, reversible or irreversible, progressive or regressive. The physical disabilities that require the use of wheelchairs imply the manufacturing of special clothing products that meet certain needs at a functional and/or therapeutic level. The study presents the main aspects involved in designing and developing textile products for this category of users. Therefore, the apparel that is specially designed for persons with disabilities has to: allow more freedom and independence when is being worn, correspond to the aesthetic point of view, offer psychological benefits and help to socially integrate the individual who wears it. In addition, clothes should not hinder the individual’s mobility and must allow the use of the chest and of the superior limbs to the maximum, they must be durable, have a low level of electrostatic charge, be absorbent and comfortable, present the so-called “rehabilitation functions”, and last but not least, be beneficial for the wearer both from a physical and psychological point of view.",

      "abstract": "Apotemnophilie, Amputee Identity Disorder oder Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID) bezeichnen das intensive Gefühl, der Körper wäre „kompletter” nach der Amputation eines Gliedes. Der Artikel diskutiert die Frage nach übereinstimmenden Persönlichkeitseigenschaften Betroffener und fragt nach Motiven. Anhand von Aussagen von 9 Personen werden Beispiele für auslösende Erfahrungen zitiert. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Kindern waren die Betroffenen oft vom Anblick eines Behinderten fasziniert. Im Artikel wird untersucht, ob das entsprechende Körperteil häufiger Erkrankungen zeigte. Geschildert wird typisches Pretending-Verhalten. Geprüft wird, ob es Parallelen zu körperdysmorphen Erkrankungen (BDD), Fetischismus oder Wahn gibt. Diese fielen gering aus, in der Mehrzahl ist der Wunsch auf ein spezifisches Körperteil fixiert, die Betroffenen sind sich der Absonderlichkeit ihres Begehrens völlig bewusst und hadern mit dem Pro und Kontra. Sexuelle Motive fanden sich bei etwa einem Drittel. Einige der Befragten befanden sich in ärztlicher oder psychologischer Behandlung; dies brachte den Amputationswunsch nicht zum Verschwinden. Bei mehreren der unter BIID-Leidenden wechselte der Amputationswunsch von einer Seite auf die andere. Dieser Befund ist mit der gängigen Theorie einer ZNS-Läsion nicht erklärbar. Diese Menschen haben eher das Ideal eines „perfekten” Körpers, der einen Arm oder ein Bein nicht umfasst. Die meisten bewundern die Schönheit eines Stumpfes und sehen Amputierte als „Helden”, die trotz der Behinderung ihr Leben meistern. BIID ist keine einheitliche Störung, sondern man muss mindestens 3 Achsen trennen: 1. Stärke der neuronalen Dysfunktion, 2. psychische Komponenten (z. B. sekundärer Krankheitsgewinn) und 3. Intensität des sexuellen Interesses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Understanding others is a key component of successful social interactions, and declines in social abilities during later life can lead to social isolation and loneliness. We investigated the relationship between different subcomponents of social cognition and loneliness in a large sample of older adults. We tested perspective-taking and mentalizing skills, alongside self-reported loneliness and social functioning. The results revealed that both loneliness and age correlated significantly with older adults' ability to resist egocentric interference when taking others' perspectives. However, mediation models showed that the effect of loneliness on egocentric tendencies was eliminated when age was accounted for. Therefore, loneliness relates to egocentrism only because egocentric tendencies increase with age, and people experience increasing levels of loneliness and feelings of social isolation with increasing age. Mentalizing and interference from others' perspectives were not influenced by loneliness or age.",

There are several evaluation assessments. Not all of them are effective, and even the more accurate tools cannot definitively determine for certain whether there is abuse. They can only suggest the possibility that there may be abuse and therefore circumstances should be further investigated to determine whether there is reason to report suspected abuse. The inherent ethical conflicts associated with reporting are also investigated. In addition, the issue of confidentiality is explored particularly with reference to privacy laws. There are 2 cases presented, and the ethical considerations are embedded throughout the cases and the summary passages.",

The most frequent sexual disorder reported by spouses of patients with dementia is sexual indifference related to apathy and blunted affect. Increase of sexual demands is rare and many behaviors considered as inappropriate or expressing hypersexuality actually express affective needs or result from cognitive disturbances. Permanence of sexual activity is most often a factor of adjustment for married dementia sufferers and their caregivers. However, some sexual behaviors are stressing for the spouses, mainly women spouses. In nursing homes or long term care facilities, expressing sexuality by demented subjects and dealing with inappropriate sexual expression are source of concerns for the nursing staff, other residents, and families. Information about sex and dementia and a psychobehavioral approach can decrease the strain of families and caregivers.",

Our aim was to establish the correlates of conspiracy thinking in an epidemiologically representative sample.US National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) data were analysed from 5645 people who had completed the item \"I am convinced there is a conspiracy behind many things in the world.\" Results were weighted to be representative of the US adult English speaking household population.1618 people (weighted 26.7%) endorsed the conspiracy belief item. These individuals were more likely to be: male; currently unmarried; less educated; in a lower income household; outside the labour force; from an ethnic minority group; not attending religious services; taking a weapon outside; and perceiving themselves as of lower social standing compared to others. Individuals endorsing the conspiracy belief item had lower levels of physical and psychological well-being, higher levels of suicidal ideation, weaker social networks, less secure attachment style, difficult childhood family experiences, and were more likely to meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder. There were no differences between those who endorsed conspiracy beliefs and those who did not in age, importance of religious beliefs in daily life, body mass index, or in having a gun at home.Viewing conspiracies in the world is associated with a raised risk of a wide range of adverse circumstances. It is a type of cognitive style that requires systematic empirical study, including monitoring of prevalence, tests of causation, and modelling of propagation.",

In other words, acceptance as part of an important ingroup is in jeopardy in identity denial situations. Typically, individuals are denied ingroup status because they do not resemble a prototypical group member, so their common ingroup identity is called into question or unrecognized by fellow group members. Identity denial is sometimes a subtle, exclusionary experience, sometimes a blatant questioning of belonging. Within recent years, there has been a growing empirical literature in psychology on denial of American identity for visible ethnic and racial minorities (e.g., Asian Americans, African Americans, and Latino/as).",

      "abstract": "Marriage involves individual rights such as opinion, privacy non-discrimination. Early marriage is the practice of marriage involving one or both partners who are still young, where both are still under the legal age or generally recognized age of adulthood. Early marriage can be influenced by various factors, namely social, pressures. Family involvement, cultural norms, and gender inequality can also play an important role in the decision to marry early. Early marriage of minors creates legal problems, which involve violations of children's rights and also gender inequality. The age for marriage must be completely mature, which is 19 years for men and 16 years for women. If both of them are still young, or you could say like young onions, their marriage will always be filled with problems. Both of them still have the same high level of egoism, are still children and still only think for a few days. In Indonesia Regulates the second amendment to Law no. 1 of 1974 confirms that the minimum age limit is 19 years, and 16 years for women. A woman is someone who has reproductive organs which are related to the ability to give birth to children. Meanwhile, a man is someone who has reproductive organs that play a role in reproduction itself. In Indonesia, the case of early marriage is still a very serious and vulnerable issue. As reported by the KEMENKO PMK, it was stated that there were around 1.2 million cases of early marriage in Indonesia. The proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married before the age of 18 was 11.21% of the total number of children. This means that around 1 in 9 women aged 20-24 years were married as children. Meanwhile, around 1 in 100 men aged 20-24 years were married as children. Due to the large number of cases regarding underage marriage, the government's role must be agile and fast in dealing with important cases like this. The government must play a role in preventing how to prevent cases of underage marriage from increasing every year.",

Time is an important factor in the equations linking isolation and loneliness. Townsend has shown that loneliness among the widowed tends to decline with the passage of time. Since isolation and loneliness are usually the product of fundamental changes or processes in the life situation of old person, it would be unrealistic to expect social visiting and support to do more than mitigate these problems in any but the most exceptional cases. Provision for old people in need of social visiting and support is largely piecemeal. The local authority provides support in some crises and caring situations, but in others it seems to be uninformed of the needs of old people, or unable to provide the staff to help.",

      "title": "Homelessness and Crime",
      "abstract": "There is considerable overlap between the homeless and correctional populations in the United States. Individuals with a history of criminal justice contact are overrepresented among the homeless and those who have recently been homeless are disproportionately concentrated among correctional populations. Such overlap is in part due to shared risk factors. Poor, low skill, men of color, and individuals with mental illness and substance abuse and dependency issues are concentrated among the homeless and incarcerated. Said marginalized persons end up in correctional facilities, shelters, and the streets primarily because of two large-scale American policies: (1) the criminalization of homelessness and (2) mass incarceration and its detrimental consequences. Concerning the former, homeless individuals typically enter the criminal justice system for minor offenses that are often the direct result of being homeless (e.g., public disorder or petty theft). Yet because they are often unable to afford an attorney or bail and have no place to go if released, homeless individuals frequently remain in jail longer than individuals with stable housing, and over time they accrue lengthy criminal histories. Notably, such practices are not new; homelessness has long been criminalized. For instance, in colonial America, the homeless were sent to poor houses, which in many cases resembled modern prisons. Today, an emerging literature suggests that mass incarceration may contribute to homelessness. Indeed, the time trends overlap: contemporary homelessness grew in tandem with incarceration, beginning in the early 1980s. Over 641,000 individuals exit prison annually, of which a portion become homeless. Obtaining stable housing is not only indicative of successful reintegration, but other forms of reintegration such as employment are often dependent on having stable housing. Furthermore, homelessness is associated with recidivism. Reintegration challenges combined with the consequences of incarceration and the concentration of standard correlates of homelessness in this population help explain why individuals leaving prison are at an elevated risk. The data challenges for studying homeless and justice-involved populations are considerable. Without a permanent address, these highly mobile individuals are missing from many traditional forms of data used by social scientists such as household surveys. As a result, much of the work on this topic is theoretical in nature. Empirical assessments rely heavily on administrative data, such as correctional and emergency shelter records, and ethnographic work. Overall, much work remains to be done to understand the pathways between homelessness and the criminal justice system. Nonetheless, homelessness is a form of severe social exclusion and when combined with the stigma of incarceration, individuals may be doubly disadvantaged. Indeed, individuals with a history of prison or jail spells are among the most disadvantaged homeless, experiencing lengthy and/or repeated homelessness. However, the overlap between homelessness and the criminal justice system can be effectively reduced. Indeed, access to affordable housing saves taxpayer money while maintaining public safety.",

      "abstract": "The findings suggest prevention tactics that recognize the importance of structuring children's interaction with adults outside the family, rather than fostering informal or private contacts. The study found that offenders who used persuasion to involve their child victims in sexual activity were more likely to have a prior history of such offending, which suggests that this tactic has worked for them in the past and reduced the risk that their offense would be detected. In many cases, the same victim had been abused repeatedly. In some cases, keeping the victims silent about the abuse involved subtle, manipulative threats such as the withdrawal of love and abandonment. The study also found that offenders who abused older children were more likely to use persuasive rather than forceful tactics. This may mean that older victims, although initially resistant to sexual activity with the offender, may be more responsive to being treated as a sexual partner than are younger children. A third finding was that offenders who acted under the strong influence of deviant sexual fantasies were more likely to use persuasive tactics with their victims. Such offenders tended to have avoidant and dependent personalities, which not only explained their attraction to non-threatening children, but also explained their reluctance to behave aggressively. The study sample consisted of 226 adult males who had been convicted of a sexual offense against a child 13 years old or younger. Data were obtained from a 6-week assessment of risk level and treatment needs when admitted for incarceration in Canada between 1995 and 2000.",

      "abstract": "Disability (Lat. Disability- powerless, weak) is a term that is very often used when referring to a person. The very concept of places a limitation on the foreground, which is why the term disabled should be used. Then the person is put in the foreground, and the present restriction or damage is placed in the foreground. The terms disability and disability are often mixed, but they are not synonymous and each term has its own meaning. The most common causes of disability are damage to the locomotor system and damage to other organs, while autism is the last on the list of causes of disability.\r\n The position of people with disabilities has changed throughout history. At the outset, people with disabilities were not accepted by society and were considered intruders. For example, people with disabilities were not allowed to go out or appear in society, to be locked up in their homes, to have no right to vote, not to have the right to education and work as others, and nothing in their environment was adapted to their condition. Today, the position of people with disabilities in society has changed a lot, so they have the right to education like others, the right to work, the right to socialize, the right to vote, and many things in the environment are adapted to their condition, although there is still room for repair and improvement. . Prejudice is still present, but in a much smaller and milder form than it was in earlier years. Research on quality of life studies has shown that people with disabilities have a satisfactory quality of life, but there are things that people with disabilities are not comfortable with. It has also been shown that people with disabilities in the older population have a worse quality of life than people with disabilities in the younger population.\r\n Attitudes are differently defined, and the individual acquires his or her views in various ways. The biggest influence on attitude formation is the environment in which the individual moves, family environment, kindergarten or school, the influence of society, etc.\r\n The aim of this research is to determine the attitudes of young people towards people with physical disabilities. The students of the 4th grade of Pakrac high school and Cakovec high school (general gymnasium and physiotherapy technician) participated in the research. The total number of respondents to the survey was 74. 74% of the respondents were female, while 26% were male. Prior to the survey itself, the consent of the schools where the research was conducted and the informed consent of the parents of the students, who are still minors, were sought. The average age of the respondents is 18 years. The survey was conducted through a questionnaire and was anonymous and voluntary. Respondents could withdraw at any time and interrupt the completion of the survey. Prior to the research, the purpose and purpose of conducting the research was explained. The examination lasted for about 15 minutes and took place within regular classes. The questionnaire consisted of 3 scales: Cognitive factor 1 and 2 and Affective factor. The cognitive factor studied the implication of deviant characteristics, the segregation of persons with physical disabilities, and the tragic perception of persons with physical disabilities. The affective factor studied the degree of discomfort of the subjects interacting with persons with physical disabilities. After collecting the data, a statistical analysis was performed to obtain the results. The results of the research showed that the students of Pakrac high school and Cakovec high school, in the direction of general high school and physiotherapy technician, have positive attitudes towards persons with physical disabilities. No statistically significant difference in attitudes was found with regard to the direction of education and gender.",

It has been shown that psychological ownership is linked to a set of attitudes and behaviours that can be beneficial or detrimental to the family firm. Among them are increased levels of commitment, engagement, loyalty and other steward-like behaviours. On the downside, however, are territoriality behaviours, hindrance of cooperation and the inability to share power and letting go.

Accidental deaths include burning from clothing catching on fire, strangulation from clothing tangling in vehicle wheels or exposed machinery, and drowning. Entanglement of clothing in machinery may also result in significant injuries, which are not uncommon in farming communities. Excessive clothing, or its absence, may significantly alter body temperature, and hanging from clothing is a feature in the young or in mentally or physically handicapped adults, or in adults who are intoxicated with alcohol or drugs. In previous years, potentially lethal amounts of arsenic were present in clothing and accessories from dyes. Clothing may also be used to form nooses or to pad ropes in suicides and may be used in cases of strangulation, suffocation, or choking in homicides. The contribution of clothing to mortality has changed over the years with changes in fashions and in manufacturing techniques. Geographical differences in clothing-related deaths persist because of variable social and cultural practices and legislative frameworks.",

Two cohorts of adolescents ( N= 393), initially assessed at 13 and 15, completed public and private self‐consciousness measures 3 times in 4 years. They also reported social comparisons and social engagement. Public self‐consciousness decreased and private self‐consciousness increased in both cohorts, and girls scored higher on both measures, both in longitudinal and sibling replication samples ( n =188). Public self‐consciousness appears to be a normative response to adolescent social challenges, with girls' higher levels largely attributable to their closer social engagement. Private self‐consciousness emerges as an individual difference in adolescence but is more likely to be salient and predictive of social behavior in adulthood.",

      "title": "Exploitation in Older Adults: Personal Competence Factors and Social Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Exploitation of older people can result in devastating emotional and financial consequences. Researchers and policy makers have widely recognised the deleterious effects of exploitation on older adults, particularly cognitively impaired older people. Studies to date have provided basic information about the demographic and health characteristics that contribute to exploitation in later life, namely extreme dependence, frailty, social isolation, severe physical illness, and cognitive impairment. However, an overarching explanatory framework of vulnerability, and clinical instruments to aid with identifying those individuals at elevated risk of exploitation a priori have been lacking. Furthermore, the specific cognitive and social factors at the level of the individual which promote vulnerability to exploitation remain largely unexplored. The present research was directed towards addressing these issues. For definitional purposes, the term social vulnerability is used throughout in reference to an individual’s degree of susceptibility to exploitation. Exploitation of older people can take many forms including social and sexual exploitation, mistreatment, and deprivation of rights. Financial exploitation in particular is a relatively widespread phenomenon among older people, and may be a salient marker of social vulnerability in later life. In Chapter 1 of this dissertation, literature relevant to financial exploitation and social vulnerability more generally among older people is reviewed, and a conceptual framework for describing and explaining heightened vulnerability is presented. Central to this framework are various factors of personal competence at the level of the individual (i.e., intelligence, cognitive functioning, social intelligence, social skill, personality traits) which, in theoretical terms, contribute to, or protect against, exploitation. Chapter 2 details the development and psychometric evaluation of a standardised scale for assessing social vulnerability among older adults (termed the SVS15). Given that financial exploitation may be a pertinent marker of social vulnerability in older people, item content for the scale includes items of a financial nature. The results of two studies provided support for the reliability (internal consistency) and validity (known-groups) of the SVS15. Results of a factor analysis revealed a two-factor solution, with the emerging factors labelled gullibility and credulity. Stability in factor structure of the SVS15 was established in an independent sample using structural equation modelling. Chapters 3 and 4 of the dissertation detail the methodology employed in, and results of, a series of three studies systematically investigating the relationships between personal competence factors and social vulnerability in older people. Using multiple regression analyses, non-significant associations between basic demographic characteristics and social vulnerability were found in a nonclinical older sample, indicating that heightened vulnerability to exploitation is not readily explained by age, gender, or education. Rather, general cognitive functioning emerged as the most significant correlate of SVS15 scores in a combined clinical and nonclinical sample of older adults such that poorer cognitive functioning was associated with greater vulnerability to exploitation. Executive functioning in particular showed significant overlap with SVS15 scores after controlling for differences in memory and age. These results support the inclusion of standardised neuropsychological tests of memory and executive functioning (tests which are routinely used) when issues of social vulnerability arise. After general cognitive functioning, social measures of self-awareness and social skill were also important correlates of social vulnerability scores, indicating that social measures could also contribute useful information when assessing social vulnerability in older people. From an applied perspective, Chapter 5 of the thesis presents normative data for the SVS15, and an examination of the Tclinical utility of the scale using individual case studies of older adults diagnosed with a dementia syndrome. In Chapter 6, an amalgamation of the results from the project is presented, and the theoretical and clinical contributions of the findings are highlighted. TThe findings contribute to the extant literature in two ways: (1) through the development of aT potentially useful and psychometrically sound instrument which targets symptoms of social Tvulnerability more directly than existing neuropsychological measures and (2) by enhancing the current understanding of the cognitive and social personal competence factors associated with heightened vulnerability in later life.",

      "abstract": "The maltreatment of children, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect, is a major worldwide public health problem. There is an extensive literature base suggesting that child maltreatment is associated with a range of adverse outcomes in adolescence and into adulthood, including mental health problems, drug and alcohol abuse, obesity and risk-taking behaviour and criminality in adulthood.However, there are weaknesses in much of the literature base on this topic.  First, there has been a heavy reliance on cross-sectional studies using retrospective self-reporting of childhood abuse by adult subjects.  There are concerns about the reliability of associations documented in this way, due to the possibility of systematic recall bias. Second, much of the earlier research has failed to adequately account for the social milieu in which child maltreatment occurs, leaving open the possibility of confounding by variables such as income, education status, and parental substance use. Third, the propensity for two or more types of maltreatment to co-occur leaves studies of single maltreatment types (e.g. sexual abuse) open to confounding by other maltreatment types. Finally, where subjects have been able to be followed longitudinally, many of the cohorts have been selected either from clinical populations, or agency-documented cases followed longitudinally but without the context of a population sample for comparison.This PhD thesis represents the first broad-ranging study of the outcomes of child maltreatment that overcomes many of the limitations of previous studies by investigating a large, population-based birth cohort – the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy, MUSP – linked with independent government agency data on exposure to specific types of child maltreatment.The thesis is presented with a series of peer-reviewed publications. While each paper has unique aims, the overall aims can be summarised as follows:(1) To examine the consequences of child abuse and neglect with a robust longitudinal methodology – including prospective, independent documentation of exposure to abuse and neglect.(2) To determine whether child neglect and emotional abuse are as, or more, important than physical and sexual abuse as antecedents of adverse outcomes on a young person’s mental health, cognitive capacity, and propensity to substance misuse; and(3) To determine whether there is a significant association between self-reporting of child maltreatment and related parenting practice – specifically adult recall of child sexual abuse, and adolescent self-report of suboptimal parenting – and independently documented government agency notification of child maltreatment.The studies showed that after adjustment for a range of potentially confounding sociodemographic variables, an agency-documented history of notification and/or substantiation of child maltreatment is associated with adverse outcomes in both adolescence (age 14) and young adulthood (age 21) on psychological, cognitive, educational, and substance-related functioning. In particular, a recurring theme among the studies is that child neglect and emotional abuse are as or more strongly associated with adverse outcomes than the more extensively studied physical and sexual abuse.",

      "title": "The Sexual Exploitation of Missing Children: A Research Review.",
      "abstract": "This review based upon empirical research findings examines the prevalence, dynamics, and short- and long-term effects of sexual exploitation of missing children. Three categories of missing children are studied: runaways, the largest group of missing children; victims of parental kidnapping; and victims of family abductions. Between 11 and 23 percent of runaways become involved in prostitution; once involved in prostitution, runaways are more vulnerable to rape and pornography. Runaways at the most risk of engaging in prostitution are those who leave home frequently and longer each time, those with a history of serious sexual abuse, those from dysfunctional families, and males who describe themselves as homosexual or bisexual. There is no evidence that victims of parental abduction are at greater risk of sexual exploitation than children in the general population. Sexual abuse sometimes accompanies nonfamily abductions, but public fears may have exaggerated this connection; when sexual abuse does occur during nonfamily abduction, the effects on these children are probably quite severe and long lasting, with the presence of many symptoms more than 4 years later.",

      "title": "Fragility and quality of life, the benefits of physical activity for the elderly",
      "abstract": "Frailty and quality of life are concepts that emerged in the second half of the 20th century. Frailty can be defined as a clinical syndrome of decreased physiological reserves and resistance against stressful events conferring high risk for adverse health outcomes, including loss of independence, falls, hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. However, it is considered that frailty can potentially be prevented or treated with specific modalities. Quality of life has various definitions because of its subjective nature. The World Health Organisation defined quality of life as \"an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns\". The aim of this study is to review information regarding the potential association between frailty and quality of life in the elderly, and the effects of physical activity among different parameters of these phenomena. There are few studies that investigate links between frailty, quality of life and physical activity. However, results tend to show that physical aspects of frailty syndrome are inversely proportional to the quality of life in several of its dimensions. Furthermore, community-based exercise programs involving the elderly seem to improve the quality of life. Considering that physical activity can potentially have an impact on the quality of life among frail elderly and promote healthy aging, further research will be necessary to corroborate these results.",

      "abstract": "Q ^•ettling for second best (or even third or fourth) is something few of us are prepared for in any public way. There are no school or college courses in how fail, or how substitute one set of goals for another when attainment of the first becomes impossible. Although we are told that it is whether one wins or loses, but how one plays the game, we are still exhorted to try and try again. Yet the crisis of failure, or an accommodation diminished expectations, is a common experience. Few of us achieve all that we want and, ultimately, through the trick of biology, there is inevitably too little time do all the things one might have desired, or of which one might have thought himself capable. The social-psychological mechanisms of the management of failure remain an unexplored area, and one could find a dozen reasons in the character of American society account for this particular failure of nerve. But the central question is not why psychology and sociology have failed attend this task, but, rather, the positive use of individual failure in the operation of society as a whole, and especially in the university. In Equality of Educational Opportunity, by James Coleman and others, there is substantial evidence support the structuring of education, at least at the elementary and high school levels, around a school and classroom mix of children of varying academic talents. Coleman's evidence argues against the existence of the track system and other forms of ability discrimination in the schools on the ground that in mixed situations the less academically talented do better and the more academically talented do no worse. Why, in social-psychological terms, those students who are conventionally labelled as less talented perform better in these situations is unclear; but the evidence is that many do perform better and that they come be more like those who appeared originally be more talented.",

This act of calling out is a direct challenge to another.

Additionally, there may be misperceived or unintended consequences to your career.\r\n\r\nThe converse is that being called out can feel threatening. Particularly if you do not understand the transgression you have been accused of, or were doing your best to be supportive of equality, diversity and inclusivity (EDI) issues but find your actions have provoked a backlash. Fear of a reaction might inhibit someone from even trying to get involved in EDI work. Additionally, responses to being called out are quite often defensive, and can result in behaviour, arguments or actions that become even more hurtful to those who are doing the calling out.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is still a need to raise EDI issues, including those around gender, though this must always be considered intersectionally.",

      "abstract": "I N THE POPULAR MIND, marital difficulties and psychoanalysis are almost synonymous. There is a widespread belief that the majority of individuals who consult a psychoanalyst come because of with marriage. If for conscious dissatisfaction is substituted unconscious with the marital state, the popular belief is correct, for no matter how diverse the symptoms which the psychoneurotic patient presents to the psychoanalyst, closer scrutiny always reveals some psychosexual dissatisfaction. A marital relation in which the ideals of the man's or the woman's personality are realized while at the same time their diverse instinctual needs also find adequate expression is the goal for which men and women are striving in marriage. Yet it is increasingly evident that a large percentage of men and women either cannot marry or, if marriage occurs, can find little happiness in it. Their discontent may find expression in illness, unfaithfulness, psychosexual difficulties such as frigidity and impotence, psychoneurotic or even psychotic manifestations such as depression, delusional jealousy, or alcoholism. Anyone who goes through the case records of any psychiatrist or psychiatric clinic will immediately be struck by the frequent coincidence between an engagement or marriage and the onset of the psychosomatic, psychoneurotic, or psychotic disorder for which the patient is consulting a physician. The patient may be completely unconscious, or more or less of a causal connection between the marriage and the illness. One striking example of the desperate measures which an individual unconsciously took in order to preserve the illusion of a perfect marriage comes to my mind. A married woman of forty was sent by an internist who had been treating her for spastic colitis. In the course of the treatment, he had been struck by something queer in her personality. The woman came to the psychiatric consultation with a very sweet, fixed smile on her face. She protested immediately, before any question could be asked, that she had no need of psychiatric help since her marriage was an absolutely ideal one. When the psychiatrist made only a nonargumentative neutral reply to this statement, she continued her story. She had been married some fifteen to twenty years. She had wanted a child very much, but her husband did not. Of course she did not mind at all, she was sure she did not care whether she had a child. Throughout the last ten years of her marriage, she had had various illnesses which were always diagnosed as nothing wrong-or functional -in character. Five years ago, her husband became impotent-which she",

Unequal treatment, ie putting a person at a disadvantage on the basis of some\r\n of their characteristics (eg skin color or gender) is a simplified notion of discrimination.\r\n Discriminatory treatment as a phenomenon often occurs during employment and in the\r\n workplace. The law sets out the grounds on which it is prohibited to treat a certain person\r\n unequally. One of the most common forms of discrimination is gender discrimination. The\r\n Gender Equality Act protects and promotes equality between women and men in the labor\r\n market, equal opportunities in employment, working conditions and promotion. In addition to\r\n the notion of discrimination, we have recently come across the term mobbing. Mobbing is\r\n considered a type of behavior in the workplace in which an individual or group, over a long\r\n period of time, psychologically abuses another person with the aim of endangering his dignity,\r\n integrity, reputation and honor. Unfortunately, such behavior in our legal system is not yet fully\r\n defined. As a result of exerting such pressure, a person may develop mental disorders, feelings\r\n of worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and fear, etc. In addition to completely reducing work\r\n performance, it usually puts a person in a situation where he sees no way out, and for fear of\r\n losing his job. , accept manipulation as something akin to the workplace, especially if it feeds\r\n the family. In the legislation of the Republic of Croatia, there are several sources that regulate\r\n the prohibition of discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and protection of dignity in\r\n the workplace, but the term mobbing is not accepted in these sources.",

Dignity depends on a balanced use of all these powers. Balance does not mean remaining constantly in a state of rigid moderation, but rather the ability to return to a state of equilibrium after a movement in any direction–a controlled giving up of control. Dignity has many faces, and it changes with time. The dignity of the young exploring child is different from that of the questioning adolescent, or from that of assured maturity, or from the wisdom of old age. And the dignity of the woman is different from that of the man. Dignity then does not depend only on the qualities of the person himself. Anyone can be robbed of dignity.",

Although peer and environmental factors play an important role in all drug use, family factors, psychological difficulties and emotional distress play a crucial role in the transition from controlled to excessive drug use. Essentially, dysfunctional parent – child relationships and severe family disruption contribute to emotional distress and to a sense of alienation from conventional sources of reward (family, school, work, and intimate relationships). For people who are distressed or alienated, heavy drug involvement can be a way to manage negative affect, bond with others, and/or experience alternative source of reward. Even people who use drugs to manage negative affect, however, are also likely to use them in some circumstances such as to have fun and be social. Excessive substance use also results in emotional distress, and it can be difficult to distinguish cause and consequence.",

      "title": "Inter-Role Conflict and Mental Health in Early Adulthood Females",
      "abstract": "Inter-role conflict is one of the most common and challenging realities. It occurs when an individual faces dual demands from different roles, and the situation is likely to cause a lot of psychological strains. This kind of conflict was most prevalent among females in the early adulthood age of development, a period that involves a turning point to other important developmental tasks in life such as procurement of employment, further educational pursuits, and formation of settlement or marriage. Work and family responsibilities become intertwined during this phase, as the drive for career advancement merges with other obligations, potentially impacting one's health. The effects of inter-role conflict on mental health can be significant, impacting such outcomes as anxiety, depression, and stress. Anxiety might manifest itself through constant apprehension or a low probability of performing well in one or more positions. At the same time, depression can cause a lack of self-worth and a negative outlook on life. Such mental health issues can lead to maladjustment in behavior, which means that one can become less productive at work as well as seclusion in their relationships. Inter-role conflict, if persistent, causes chronic stress, which worsens these concerns and may lead to irreversible mental health problems. This review also explores the impact of inter-role conflict on mental health outcomes and explores potential strategies to mitigate these effects. Some realistic approaches to reducing the psychological load include time management, role prioritization, and seeking social support. This literature review emphasizes the importance of psychological strategies from existing literature to help young women manage their roles more effectively. Therefore, by integrating literature from the existing research, this study illuminates how inter-role conflict affects early adulthood females’ mental health with a focus on coping strategies.",

For many young people, substance use reflects a cascading effect whereby earlier difficulties contribute to substance use onset and escalation, which then cascades into other difficulties. In contrast, this cascading flow can get interrupted, resulting in ontogenetic discontinuity whereby substance use and other risky behaviors during adolescence are more the result of developmentally proximal individual and contextual characteristics than distal ones. This discontinuity can reflect either a temporary developmental disturbance or a turning point, a permanent change in course. Substance use is intertwined with the many developmental changes of adolescence, providing some developmentally functional experiences while posing serious risks to health and well-being that can reverberate into adulthood.",

These include youngsters with developmental deficiencies that interfere with their capacity to master the environment. Children with a strong family history of alcoholism or drug abuse also seem to be at high risk. Obviously, there is some overlap between these two groups, not only because parental drug abuse and alcoholism may damage the fetus, but because chemically dependent parents are more likely to abuse or neglect their children because of the impact of their own illness on their functioning as parents. In addition, families in which drug use is modeled as a typical behavior are more likely to produce adolescents who use drugs, although rigid rules against drug use are relatively ineffective in preventing adolescents from experimenting with drugs. Finally, certain behavior patterns in young childhood--particularly severe aggressiveness, rebelliousness, and learning problems at school--seem to be correlated with the development of chemical dependency during adolescence.",

      "title": "STATE CHILD EMOTIONAL ABUSE LAWS: THEIR FAILURE TO PROTECT CHILDREN WITH GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER",
      "abstract": "Emotional abuse of children with Gender Identity Disorder by parents is very difficult to identify and prevent. State investigators of abuse and neglect often have a hard time determining if the reasons for mental illness and psychological harm in children are due to the actions of their parents, or if they stem from other sources. Once identified, it becomes even harder to prove in court for purposes of ordering services or removing the child from the home if the abuse is severe enough. With children who are gender non-conforming, this task becomes exponentially more difficult due to the low prevalence rate, discrimination, stereotypes, and a parent's right to bring up their child as they choose. These youth face discrimination and violence in school, work, their communities, and also within their own families. Emotional abuse statutes are too vague to protect youth who are gender non-conforming. The vague and unclear laws lead to inconsistency in the application of the law and lack of protection of the children because judges and investigators are not aware of how parent's actions harms youth with gender identity disorder. Therefore, states should adopt the model statute within this Note which defines specific actions by parents which would not qualify as abuse when involving gender conforming youth but qualifies as abuse for children with gender identity disorder. Many states already have statutes which define physical abuse, sexual abuse and abandonment by specific actions by parents towards their children. This proposal will enable both the state and the judges to properly identify victims with gender identity disorder of emotional abuse and provide for their protection.",

      "abstract": "I conclude that Mary and Abe's decision to conceive a child to save a child does not impose harm on persons or on relationships in the family. Nor does it evince a lack of respect for the child they have conceived. The ethical guidelines that support this conclusion can now be summarized. First, actions should not depersonalize or otherwise endanger personal relationships. Second, although ideally personal relationships are initiated and continued for their own sake, after a personal relationship has been established and sustained the motives for establishing it recede in importance. Third, the requirement of honesty looms especially large in the context of personal relationships. Fourth, privacy protects personal relationships in the family from intrusion by the state. Fifth, even if those with whom we stand in personal relationships are not fully rational or self-conscious, we should treat them with respect. Finally, persons often are called upon to make greater sacrifices in personal relationships. These principles represent only the barest beginnings of an ethics for filial relationships. Nonetheless, they mark progress in the direction of developing a more complete account. We should not suppose that ethics in the family always will be spontaneous or natural. Over a century ago, Mill warned that nature and natural are one of the most copious sources of false taste, false philosophy, false morality, and even bad law. Especially in the wake of medical advances, such as recombinant DNA and new reproductive technologies, the complexity of filial ethics will only increase. The demographics of an aging society will add further complexity to filial contexts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A distinction can be made between emotional loneliness that occurs when an individual lacks an intimate relationship with one special person such as a spouse or parent, and social loneliness that occurs when an individual lacks friends or has no sense of belonging to a community. Solitude is not invariably accompanied by loneliness. In the past decade, research on loneliness has expanded rapidly, spurred in part by the development of reliable paper-and-pencil instruments to assess loneliness. Like other forms of psychological distress, loneliness is more common among lower socioeconomic groups. Loneliness is most common among adolescents and young adults, and is less often reported by people in older age groups. The immediate cause of loneliness is typically some event that produces a significant deficit in a person's social relations.",

      "abstract": "This article shows the extent of the problem of an individual being unprotected from the manipulation and its harm. No one is fully immune to manipulation and everyone can become a victim of manipulative actions. It is demonstrated that manipulative relationships have taken roots in modern society and there is a tendency for a wider spread. 92-95% respondents who have had negative state of mind resulting from being manipulated would like to learn how to protect themselves from manipulation. It is established that if individuals are focussed on themselves, they are less prone to being manipulated; if individuals are focussed on relationship they are more likely to be subject to manipulation. The personal characteristics helping to be immune to manipulation are shown, i.e. a rather high social intellect of an individual, their independence from people’s opinions, low levels of trust and inquisitive minds. It is shown that 1) females are better protected from manipulation than males; 2) the degree of protection against manipulation does not depend on the person’s age and the degree of machiavellism of their personality; 3) the individuals’ assertiveness helps to protect themselves from manipulation. The representation level of this research and its results are guaranted by the number of participants (552 respondents) and the wide social representation: firemen, university teachers and students, military cadets, psychologists, retail employees.",

This type of discrimination was described in the 60s of the XX century, but concern about this phenomenon at the level of who and the UN arose only in the early 2000s. Research has established many causes of ageism: negative stereotypes about older people, upbringing, negative experience of interaction between older people and other age groups, etc. There are explicit and latent, deliberate and unintentional ageism. Proposed various methods for the identification of ageism. The article examines the causes of this type of discrimination, forms of its manifestation and existing research methods, and based on the literature data, offers suggestions for possible ways to combat ageism.",

      "title": "A Differential Analysis of the Subtypes of Unresolved States of Mind in the Adult Attachment Interview",
      "abstract": "Abstract Disorganized attachment is most prevalent among high-risk populations, such as maltreated children. Recent attachment literature has demonstrated that one of the best predictors of attachment disorganization is an “Unresolved” parental state of mind regarding a loss or an abuse in the parent's own attachment history. However, although classification in the Unresolved (U) category is always accompanied by specification of the type of trauma that is unresolved (loss, physical abuse, or sexual abuse), much of attachment research has focused on unresolved attachment as one category. The current paper reviews the empirical literature on the parenting outcomes associated with different subtypes of U. The literature demonstrates that parents who have experienced loss or abuse in childhood, which remains unresolved, exhibit atypical care-giving behaviors. Specifically, a history of loss or childhood sexual abuse is found to be associated with more passively withdrawn parental interactions, whereas a history of physical abuse is related to increased negative and hostile interactions. In addition, there appears to be differences in caregiving behaviors between parents whose underlying attachment state of mind is secure versus insecure.",

Research also shows that individuals with mental illnesses are likely to die 15–20 years younger than those who do not have these illnesses. In addition, they are more likely to experience delays in help-seeking leading to poor outcomes and are more likely to experience physical illnesses. Stigma and discrimination appear to play a major role in depriving people with mental illnesses of their basic rights. Their economic, political, social, and human rights are often ignored. In this article, we describe the capability to be healthy and basic principles of social justice related to mental health. We discuss findings of discrimination often embedded in laws of countries around the world in the context of basic human rights. We believe that clinicians have a key role as advocates for their patients. Clinicians and policymakers need to work together to bring about social and health equity.",

(For a psychoanalytic account of adolescent group violence see Hyatt Williams 1997.)Basically, yes! Aggression is a natural part of life and a major source of\nenergy. It is vital for progressive development but without appropriate\ncontrol and management, it can get out of hand and lead to violence.\nWithout aggression we would not be able to assert or protect ourselves or\nothers, learn or work effectively, separate or develop autonomy (Winnicott\n1963).

In situations of very real danger, violent aggression\nto protect the self or others may be entirely appropriate.

      "abstract": "Although adolescence cannot be said to be a medical condition, and although most adolescents are healthy, some do become ill. But the adolescent is not a patient like any other...Today, the age of majority is set in most jurisdictions at the age of 18 years, but in the context of medical treatment, many countries do recognise a certain level of autonomy (to a greater or lesser extent) of adolescents who are deemed to be mature. However, the extent of this autonomy raises many questions. Is the consent of the adolescent required, along with that of the parents, before any intervention may take place? Do they have a right of veto? Is their consent alone enough? Are they recognised as having the right to take part in medical trials, the right to refuse necessary treatment...? These and many other questions are at the heart of this multidisciplinary and international study, which is the fruit of reflection and discussion between lawyers, philosophers, sociologists and child psychologists during the 2nd Workshop of the International Academic Network on Bioethics. The issues raised go well beyond law because they engender questions of the individuality of the adolescent and her ability to make choices when faced with illness and even her own death. Despite the complexity and depth of the subject, the chapters in this volume clearly reveal the status of the adolescent in medical decisionmaking, in sixteen different countries. Despite obvious differences between the systems studied, the one thing that is clear is the gradual recognition of the adolescent's growing autonomy in medical decisionmaking which is not always expressly provided for in legislation. Such an evolution is hardly surprising at a time when the distinction between adolescence and adulthood is becoming less certain for many.",

Availability of family and/or friends as a source of support was found to be most important for satisfactory coping. Loneliness, isolation, loss of former friendships, and ostracism by former intimate friends were some of the perceptions of the widows. Sexual problems, especially frustration, were evident among many widows. Adaptation to sexual frustration included sexual affairs with men who would not ordinarily be considered a partner, such as the married or one's physician. All widows reported that the sexual relationship was salubrious, which has implications for counselors and therapists comforting the widowed or providing death education. Each widow's individual personality and life events affected coping. Increased mental and physical ailments after the death of their spouse, especially in the first year of bereavement were reported by 15 of the 18 widows.",

This paper reports the results of preliminary analyses of self-reported data on arrests and criminal behaviour from the Vietnam Era Veteran Twin Registry. The subjects for the study were 3226 male twin pairs in which both members served in the military during the Vietnam era. There were significant influences from both genetic factors and the common environment on early arrests. Genetic factors, but not the common environment, significantly influenced whether subjects were ever arrested after age 15, whether subjects were arrested more than once after age 15, and later criminal behaviour. The common environment, but not genetic factors, significantly influenced early criminal behaviour. The environment shared by the twins has an important influence on criminality while the twins are in that environment, but the shared environmental influence does not persist after the individual has left that environment. Genes are likely to influence the occurrence of criminal behaviour in a probabalistic manner by contributing to individual dispositions that make a given individual more or less likely to behave in a criminal manner.",

It seems that uncontrolled plenty can be as sure a cause of disorganization as uncontrolled and unsupported destitution.

      "abstract": "SUMMARY While on one hand, when one grows old, one becomes, vulnerable to stresses because fewer resources are available, ageing an the other hand confers certain advantages in coping with stresses in life. Illness as a stress taxes considerable energy and efforts from the elderly in coping with it. Systematic studies in Chinese are few and far between. Empirical research in this regard is in want. Keywords: stress, coping, ageing, Chinese STRESSES AT OLD AGE In general, life is characterised by a multiplicity of stresses. People react to these stresses with their own clusters of defense mechanisms or coping skills. As a result, these protective mechanisms determine the amount of strain an individual experiences and the subsequent likelihood of its expression as psycho-pathology. In particular, old age is marked by the presence of a wide range of stressors. The older person is often subject to biological deterioration, social extrusion, and economic deprivation. The course of events at this period of lifespan is such that these traumas may occur in rapid succession without allowing the person time to regain his balance before confronting the next stressor. Even taken individually, particular stressors will separately dictate an array of coping mechanisms for successful outcomes. Evans (1984) draws on a number of studies to suggest that adverse life events occur more frequently in old age and that their occurrence causally increases the prevalence of illness in old age. As the elderly population encounters these and other loss events, resolution of life events may be hampered by their relative social status in relation to younger age groups. Dowd (1980) has argued that social exchange between young and older age groups is characterised by an imbalance in the exchange ratio which effectively places the elderly in a double bind, namely, that declining resources in old age entails negotiating from weakness at a time when resources are exchanged for less than they would be for a younger person. Alternatively, it is still possible that older adults actually encounter fewer stressful events than the young (Lowenthal, Thurber & Chiriboga, 1975; George, 1980; Harris, 1989). But the fact remains. many of the stresses of younger adults' lives have pleasant aspects. Leaving home, getting married, having a baby, buying a house, getting a promotion are all stressful, but they also bring challenge and reward. In contrast, many of the stresses of later adulthood are primarily negative: poor health, reduced income, death of a spouse (Chiriboga & Cutler, 1980). In this line of thought, problems in the life of the aged often are conceptualised as divergences from an optimal state of well-being, whether these divergences are caused by health problems, or by loss of social roles, economic resources, or significant others (Atchley, 1989). However, it may in fact be the case that the elderly are particularly prone to experience multiple, albeit low prevalence of, life events, which could act synergistically to cause decline in well-being (Fried & Bush, 1988). None the less, even when elderly people might cope better with loss of a spouse or close relatives, and friends than do younger counterparts, they undoubtedly exhibit greater vulnerability when confronted with certain life events. Notable among these is residential relocation. This has local relevance when we realise there is a booming industry of old-aged home in Hong Kong owing to mass emigration of younger people In recent years (Cheng, 1993). WHY MORE VULNERABLE While the potentially adverse consequences of stress are universal and apply across the lifespan, there are at least several reasons why elderly person are particularly vulnerable. Firstly, relative to younger contemporaries, they are typically confronted with a multitude of major life events following on the heels of each other. …",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The review assesses recent research and its impact on understanding of intimacy and sexuality in older adults with dementia. Recent findings There is no universally accepted definition of inappropriate sexual behaviors (ISBs), but they have been divided into overt acts associated with increased libido and uninhibited sexual behaviors directed at oneself or other people. Couples affected by dementia frequently maintain physical intimacy. Nonintercourse intimate activities may be preferred over intercourse. Early therapeutic interventions may assist partners in modifying activities, behaviors, and expectations about the future of the relationship. Inappropriate sexual behaviors are commonly due to the disruption of interconnected brain structures. Trauma to the temporal lobes may lead to hypersexuality and ISB. Trauma to the limbic system can produce changes in sexual preference. Both temporal and frontotemporal dementias, or either of them, often present with socially and sexually inappropriate behaviors. Huntington's disease can exhibit hypersexuality, pedophilia, promiscuity, and marital infidelity. The involvement of the medial striatum of the basal ganglia in this disease explains the prevalence of ISB. There is no consensus regarding first-line pharmacotherapy for ISB. Little information is known about the adverse effects. Summary Clinicians and society need to consider how dementia might affect physical intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We focus on three aspects of health inequalities. The first is the role of adult adversities such as chronic work stress, breakdown of intimate relationships, social isolation and discrimination, all of which contribute to increased morbidity and to premature mortality. These experiences are more common among less advantaged groups, so promote health inequalities. Second, we emphasize the impact of multimorbidity, the presence of two or more long-term physical and mental health conditions, on health inequalities. Inequalities in mental ill-health early in life are directly linked to later physical health inequalities, highlighting the critical importance of managing multiple conditions effectively. Third, we discuss socio-economic inequalities in protective psychological characteristics, such as purpose in life, optimism and positive well-being. These experiences are graded by education, income and occupational prestige. They are not only health protective but also malleable. Enhancing these factors through psychological and social interventions may contribute to reductions in health inequalities.",

A cabinet minister or lawyer has high status; a window cleaner or bus driver, low status. Informal status is gained by individuals because of special talents or skills. A miner may have high status among his peers because he is a reliable and likeable workmate. A skinhead may have high status as a 'nutter' to be feared. Ascribed status is social position or roles into which you are born — you may have high status through being born into Social Class I or low status because you are black. Achieved status is status acquired by your own effort or actions. You may be born the illegitimate son of a servant girl (low status) and become Prime Minister (high status) as did Ramsay MacDonald; or you may start off as a peer of the realm and end up a penniless criminal.

Sexual activity is a means for the elderly to affirm physical functioning, to maintain a strong sense of identity and to establish self-confidence. However, not all elderly persons have positive attitudes towards sexuality. Even healthy elderly persons may internalize the stereotypes towards aging. The elderly will be viewed as: • Asexual invalids; • Dirty old men; • Lecherous old women. Negative attitude about masturbation and homosexuality can interfere with sexual expression.

      "title": "Developmental social vulnerability as the intrinsic origin of psychopathology: A paradigm shift from disease entities to psychiatric derivatives within human diversity",
      "abstract": "How a social episode is perceived by a person and how the experience affects her/his subsequent behaviors will inevitably and sometimes accidentally vary in each case on the developmental trajectory from the birth of consciousness to death. Both the preceding developmental conditions and the social impact of the episode become a starting point for the following states of human complex conditions, creating the extraordinary diversity that characterizes our complex society. In this evolutionarily carved landscape, genetic factors including stochastic epistasis, environmental modification, and gene-environment interactions are all active. In these processes, interactions between developmental social vulnerability and environmental influences can lead to the emergence and persistence of some derivative states with social maladaptation. In our model, every psychiatric condition including aberrant paranoid-hallucinatory states is classified as a derivative state. The probability distribution curve for these derivative states has a non-linear relationship with the liability in the population, and there is none with probability 1.0 or zero. Individuals with trivial social vulnerability or high resilience may develop the derivative states in tremendously stressful circumstances, and individuals with huge social vulnerability may not necessarily develop the derivative states in the presence of adequate social supports. Social skillfulness/unskillfulness and behavioral flexibility/inflexibility form the core of the vulnerability-related dimensions. The clinical picture of a derivative manifestation is profiled depending on the individual trait levels in the derivative-related dimensions. Each derivative state has a requisite lineup of dimensions and each dimension can contribute to multiple psychiatric conditions. For example, aberrant paranoid-hallucinatory states and bipolar condition may share some developmental conditions as the derivative-related dimensions. Therefore, multiple derivative states can co-occur or be sequentially comorbid. Although the 'learned strategies' can ostensibly mask the clinical manifestation of developmental deviations, the change of the true dimensional position to the socially skillful direction is efficiently obtained through social experiences in a supportive environment. The liability-probability model makes it impossible to discriminate individuals with psychiatric diagnosis from individuals without the diagnosis and allows all of us to reside in the same human complex diversity.",

      "abstract": "Self-enhancement and self-protection are constrained by reality. But to what extent? Broader constraints, often considered powerful, such as East-Asian culture, religion, mind-body practices, and prison environments are not particularly effective deterrents. Narrower constraints, also considered powerful, such as self-reflection and mnemic neglect, are not very helpful either. Deliberate and systematic laboratory efforts, both at the intrapersonal level (e.g., explanatory introspection, salience of one's faults) and the interpersonal level (e.g., accountability, relationship closeness), can boast success in constraining self-enhancement and self-protection strivings, but the success is mixed, difficult to implement, and probably short-lived. The doggedness (potency and prevalence) of self-enhancement and self-protection are due to the functions or social benefits with which they are associated or confer: psychological health, goal pursuit and attainment, leadership election, and sexual selection. These functions are traceable to our species' evolutionary past.",

Building on the growing literature that considers the subjective experience of being physically active, we explored the meanings that older Canadian men attributed to physical activity broadly defined. Thus, we examined their experiences and perceptions of exercise, sport and/or leisure-time physical activities. Data are presented from qualitative interviews with 22 community-dwelling Canadian men aged 67–90. Our analysis resulted in three overarching categories that subsumed the men's understanding of physical activity. ‘I do it for my health’ described how the men stated that their primary reason for engaging in exercise was to maintain their health and body functionality so that they could age well and continue to participate in sport and leisure. ‘It feels good’ referred to the various ways that the men derived pleasure from being active, including the physical sensations, psychological benefits and social connections they derived from their participation. ‘It gets tougher’ detailed the ways that the men were finding physical activity to be increasingly difficult as a result of the onset of health problems, declining body functionality and the social realities of ageing. We discuss our findings in light of the extant literature concerning age relations, ageism, and the third and fourth ages.",

      "abstract": "We have presented data on 69 female alcoholics who have had three or more interviews. Almost all are of high socioeconomic status. The majority are Protestant and college-educated. They drink at home and do not come to the attention of public agencies. Their childhoods were invariably disturbed, with a dependent relationship toward a cold, dominant parent, usually the mother. Half the fathers were alcoholic. Many patients felt an identification with the father rather than the mother. All patients grew up feeling inadequate and worthless and unable to express their hostility directly. Marital disharmony appeared to be the most frequent factor perpetuating our patient's alcoholism, though many had drunk heavily before marriage. The marriages were troubled by inadequate emotional communication and poor sexual adjustment. Nevertheless, they were remarkably long-lasting and free of infidelity. The husbands were usually overtly domineering but invariably controlling and unable to express feelings. Patients who remained single had retained the ambivalent dependent relationship toward one or both parents. Alcohol, initially the \"enabling drug\" which provided the missing feelings of adequacy and acceptability, became later the releaser of hostility, tool of revenge, and means of self-punishment. All patients exploded their anger when drunk. The following modal pattern appeared in 27 of our cases: cold domineering mother, warmer but alcoholic father, \"miserable self-image,\" cold domineering husband, resort to alcohol patterned after father's drinking. We have speculated on what basic factors may be crucial to the development of alcoholism in an individual woman.",

      "title": "Gender competence and mental health promotion",
      "abstract": "Cultural competence is a familiar construct. It encompasses individual attitudes and behaviors, as well as organizational policies related to consideration of culture in practices and services. It reflects values about diversity and rights to equitable access to care, and the skills to enable people, agencies and systems to work effectively in culturally pluralist situations. Gender competence is less familiar. It comprises the capacity to recognize gender-based discriminatory attitudes and behaviors; knowledge about gender-based policies and initiatives to improve equality of opportunities and outcomes; and actions to counter gender-based stereotypes in research, learning environments and clinical practice. Gender competence in health care promotes equity in health outcomes. Stereotypes are qualities assigned to groups of people based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation or other traits. Gender-based stereotypes are fixed beliefs and attributions about characteristics, capabilities and behaviors based on a person's sex. They are always limiting, including of rights and entitlements. They reinforce disparities in privileges and power in private and public spheres of life, and influence day-to-day exchanges in relationships. They are automatic and can be embedded in a single word or descriptive phrase, and are harmful when used to predict, judge or understand human behavior1. Worldwide, women carry higher burdens of unpaid work and caregiving, and have disproportionate experiences of childhood maltreatment, and violence perpetrated by an intimate partner. They have less access to the protections of education, income-generating work and financial decision-making. These carry risks for their mental health across the life course2. Gender-based stereotypes are revealed in attitudes and beliefs about women's roles and responsibilities, including work, caregiving and income generation; and violent transgressions of their human rights, in clinical practice, research and public health initiatives. There are principles about the management and prevention of occupational fatigue in workplaces in which there are long and irregular hours, including shift work. These prescribe maximum safe working hours, required nights of consecutive rest to recover from nightshifts, and intervals for sleep between shifts. However, because of gender stereotypes, there are no workplace safety requirements about occupational fatigue when the home is the workplace, and the work is caring for an infant. Smith and Ellwood3 assessed time spent on caregiving and available for sleep among mothers of three-month-old infants, using an electronic recording device. On average, there were 49 feeds, each lasting about 75 min, and 70 other occasions of carrying/holding/soothing the infant, for about 18 min each time, a total of more than 82 hours caregiving work per week. Mothers' sleep was in 18 different episodes, each lasting about 3 hours. The experiences are worse if the baby cries inconsolably and wakes frequently. Among women admitted consecutively to a residential early parenting centre for assistance with their unsettled babies, 80% had on average less than 6/24 hours sleep in the prior week, and 91% met criteria for clinically significant fatigue4. The usual ways in which clinicians enquire about these experiences include: Are you working?; When are you giving up work?; When are you going back to work?; Does he help you? Researchers classify women as not working or as working outside the home5. This reveals stereotypes that the endeavour of caring for an infant is not work, is not socially valued and is a female obligation with which men help. Women incorporate these pervasive stereotypes, reflected in the common responses that \"I don't work\" or \"I am only a mother\" . Prevalence varies among countries, but violence against women and girls is a universal phenomenon. Violent transgressions of the human rights of females begin prior to birth and occur across the life course in domestic, institutional and community settings. They encompass, but are not limited to, female feticide, sexual abuse of girls, female genital mutilation, dowry-related violence, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, trafficking, and violence perpetrated by an intimate partner. Women who are Indigenous or members of ethnic or religious minority groups, occupying low socio-economic positions, or refugees or asylum-seekers, are especially vulnerable6. Experiencing or witnessing interpersonal violence, especially when it occurs within households, is always harmful to mental health. The World Health Organization considers violence to be the principal gender-related cause of mental health problems among women7. For most of the 20th century, violence against women received scant research attention or recognition by clinicians and policy-makers. The first epidemiological surveys of perinatal mental health problems among women were published in the 1960s. Difficulties in the relationship with an intimate partner were more prevalent among the group with than without mental health problems, but this was conceptualized as women being depressed, having difficulties in their biological role and regarding their husbands as unhelpful and unsympathetic8. The first systematic review of the evidence about the relationship between intimate partner violence and perinatal mental health problems was published in 2013. Violence experienced during pregnancy was associated with a near five-fold increase in antenatal (odds ratio, OR=5, 95% CI: 4.04-6.17) and postnatal (OR=4.36, 95% CI: 2.93-6.48) depression9. Most countries, including well-resourced high-income nations, were unable to contribute data to this review because none were available. Despite this evidence, the predominant theme in the contemporary literature is that women's mental health problems are biologically caused and have adverse effects on their partners, children and families. The alternative interpretation that their mental health problems might be a consequence of their environmental exposures remains rare5. Gender-informed approaches to mental health promotion require specific acknowledgement of gender-based risks. These are underpinned by frank recognition of gender stereotypes and how these influence the ways in which research is conceptualized and designed, and data are collected and interpreted, as well as the language that is used in clinical encounters and recommendations in health promotion initiatives. Gender competence requires explicit and intentional consideration of past experiences and current predicaments within their social and cultural contexts. Gender competence therefore seeks to comprehend and address experiences of discrimination, interpersonal violence and being devalued, and to counter internalized beliefs about roles, rights and responsibilities. Researchers, clinicians and public health professionals who advocate for these strategies and implement these approaches can be powerful agents of social change.",

By spreading information on the behavior of individuals, shaming encourages one to maintain his reputation and facilitates beneficial transactions. Finally, it helps the public to avoid inefficient services. \r\n\r\nYet shaming raises many problems. Anyone can shame another based on individual, as opposed to universal, values, thus offending certain segments of society just because they are different. Shaming can also insult human dignity disproportionately. When the initiators of shaming are private citizens, as opposed to courts, it is committed without fact-checking or due process and can promote the dissemination of falsehoods. Shaming can also spin out of control and develop into a “lynch mob,” violence, and harassment. Thus, an action that started with an aspiration to promote social order can lead to social turmoil. \r\n\r\nShaming is nothing new—people have been doing it for centuries. But the digital era makes shaming easier. Every person can write a post, publicize inappropriate behavior, and shame others. A post on the internet can travel around the world and be shared by millions of users within seconds. Digital technologies make it difficult to keep shaming under control. Thus, it can spread like wildfire, be taken out of context, and develop into defamation, harassment, cyberbullying, and even mass violence against an individual. It can harm individuals who did not violate norms or sanction individuals disproportionately.\r\n\r\nIn the digital age, forgetting has become the exception and remembering the rule. Online shaming is not ephemeral and is searchable through a simple Google query. It leaves a trail that follows the individual everywhere. \r\n\r\nShould the law provide a relief for online shaming? If so, when and how? This Article addresses these questions and aims to provide answers. It focuses on the shaming of ordinary people who are not public figures and are not corporations. It outlines the phenomenon, and addresses shaming’s virtues and flaws. Then it sets forth a taxonomy of three types of shaming: (1) “good shaming”—shaming that is initiated by the court and carried out according to a judicial decision or recommendation; (2) “bad shaming”—shaming an individual by spreading false defamatory rumors, or shaming that got out of control and evolved into defamation or harassment; and (3) “shaming the ugly behavior”—the shaming of a person by private individuals for violating the law, or norms.\r\n\r\nThis Article focuses on non-ephemeral online shaming. It examines whether search engines should remove links to search results that contain shaming, and if so, when. The Article focuses on the characteristics of digital dissemination that amplify harm to dignitary interests. It explains that the characteristics of the internet and its influences on online expressions can justify new remedies for dissemination of shaming, beyond the traditional remedies for harm that reach the threshold of criminal or tort law. \r\n\r\nThe Article overviews the benefits and shortcoming of the “right to be forgotten.” It demonstrates that the benefits and shortcomings are not equally valid in all circumstances. Following this analysis, the Article argues that a dichotomous perspective that chooses between oblivion and permanent memory is inappropriate. This Article makes the case for a differential right to be forgotten that acknowledges nuances of shaming, which outlines nuanced guidelines for delisting links to search results of shaming expressions, depending on the type of shaming.",

      "abstract": "The article analyzes age-related changes of psychol ogical well-being of an individual in middle and late adulthood. It is rev ealed that dissociated structure of psychological well-being that is characteristic of the second half of the middle adulthood (ages 50 to 59) is getting more integrate during la te adulthood, reaching integration peak at the age of 66–69 years. Such structure is suppor ted by expressed orientation of an individual to the communication motive and is regul ated by self-confidence and self- respect of a person under conditions of absence of inner conflicts and self-accusations. For women it is more important to have a positive s elf-attitude, while for men – not to have negative one. During pre-peak period (ages 5 0 to 59) experience of psychological well-being rolls out at the background of the weakl y expressed tendency to decrease the motive of general activity; in post-peak period ( ages 70 to 79) motivational profile of a personality becomes little differentiated. In both cases individual’s self-confidence is growing, however, the position of inner independenc e and autonomy is lost. The conclusion is made that the age of 66–69 years is t he most favorable period of late adulthood from the viewpoint of integrity of psycho logical well-being of a person. Psychological accompaniment of positive functioning of women lies in the correction of negative self-attitude (ages 50 to 59), protection of inner world from excessive external interference (ages 60 to 65), stimulation of positi ve self-attitude (ages 66 to 69), combination of positive self-attitude stimulation a nd negative self-attitude correction (ages 70 to 79). There is a different strategy of w orking with men: support of positive self- attitude (ages 50 to 59), negative self-attitude co rrection (ages 60 to 69), protection of inner world from external interference (ages 70 to 79).",

      "abstract": "The seeds of Healthy Aging are sown much earlier in life, through the health choices we make in younger adulthood and midlife. Cumulative effects of good health behaviors throughout one's life often pay off in older adulthood, in the form of healthy aging (optimal physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning), whereas poorer choices earlier in life can lead to suboptimal or even pathological aging. Personality characteristics are important predictors of health behaviors and thus influence the course of healthy aging. Personality also impacts other precursors to healthy aging, such as educational attainment, work and career choices, financial success, relationship and family outcomes, and attitudes toward engagement and involvement in later life. Through multiple pathways, not only health and health behavior, personality predicts positive aging-related outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Do males and females differ in their antisocial behaviour? This question has been addressed by developmental psychologists, social psychologists, psychiatrists, and criminologists. The answers provided are not always exactly the same for several reasons. First, different disciplines measure different behaviours that may or may not measure the same latent variable. For example, whereas child psychologists often focus on behaviours in situ such as rough-and-tumble play, criminologists tend to index antisocial behaviour through official records of conviction for crime. Second, different disciplines focus on antisocial behaviour at different points in the life span. Developmental researchers tend to focus on the early years of life, psychiatrists focus on adolescents, social psychologists focus on college students in their late teens and early twenties, and criminologists focus on older juveniles and adults. Third, different disciplines often rely on different methods to measure antisocial behaviour. For example, developmentalists often rely on observational methods, social psychologists rely on standardized experimental paradigms to elicit analogue responses, psychiatrists use diagnostic data gathered via parental and self-reports, and criminologists favor still different types of data, such as self-report interviews and police and court records.",

      "title": "Witchcraft and Ancestor Worship",
      "abstract": "Each of these religious beliefs shares in the same functions as follows: explanation of various misfortunes; moral sanction; and maintenance of a social structure.Besides each of them stands in a complementary relationship with one another in its functions indicated above. In many societies sudden death or serious diseases are thought to be caused by witches. Whereas ancestores give misfortunes of less severity, for ancestors do harms only when their descendants fail to observe their traditional way of living or their duties towards their kinsmen or ancestors, so that the descendants may correct their misbehaviors.Witches are generally associated with such character that tends to bring troubles into human relations. In this way people succeed in rejecting and banishing the persons of too much envious, competitive or uncompromising character from their society. Consequently witch-craft belief regulates the relationship between co-wives, neighbors and co-workers. Ancestor worship, on the contrary, gives sanction upon the relationship between a senior and a junior member of a kin group. Unless a son obeys his father's command, misfortunes fall upon the son, for the irritated father would not sacrifice to the ancestor in favor of his son.Witchcraft belief contributes to the maintenance of the solidarity of a group in two ways: it gives a safe way of dissolving frustrated feelings of the members which are created by conflicts that institutions and systems of the society might inevitably produce; and it prohibits the accusation of a witch within an intimate, cooperative kin group in which a collaborate relationship should be retained lest the fundamentally required stability of the society as a whole should not be broken. On the other hand ancestor worship considerably reinforces the authority of heads of kin groups of various size. The right of giving sacrifices to the ancestor is ascribed only to the heads, and thus the rest of the members must depend upon the heads in order to secure their ancestor's favor. In these ways the solidarity of the cooperative relationship among the members of a society is effectively strengthened and maintained by witchcraft belief and ancestor worship.",

      "title": "The rejected stalker and the resentful stalker",
      "abstract": "One of the commonest forms of stalking is that which emerges in the context of the breakdown of a close relationship. Typically the rejected partner begins to stalk after their partner has attempted to end the relationship, or indicated that he or she intends to end the relationship. The overt aim of the stalking is either to attain a reconciliation or to exact revenge for the rejection. In practice the stalker not infrequently entertains a mixture of both of these goals, the dominant motivation shifting with circumstances and the ex-partner's responses. The usual relationship to give rise, at its dissolution, to stalking is an intimate sexual partnership, but the breakdown of any close relationship in which the rejected partner has invested emotional energy can usher in stalking. In our own experience we have seen stalking emerge following rifts between close friends, parents and their children, longterm work and business partnerships and even therapists and their clients (patients). The essential elements are the stalker's sense of having had his or her rights and prerogatives violated by the unilateral attempt to sever the relationship, combined, to a greater or lesser extent, with a sense of loss at the end of an important relationship. The rage at rejection is often augmented by distress at the perceived unfairness or humiliating nature of the rejection.",

Such inaccuracy may result from the fact that true justifications are socially undesirable or less persuasive than competing justifications or are unavailable in conscious awareness. Because of the delicate nature of these issues, people may be particularly likely to misstate the reasons for preferences on gay marriage, abortion, abstinence-only education, and premarital sex. Advocates on both sides typically justify their preferences in terms of preserving social order, maintaining moral values, or protecting civil liberties, not in terms of their own sexual preferences. Though these are the stated reasons, in empirical tests we find that psychophysiological response to sexual images also may be a significant driver of policy attitudes.",

      "title": "Shyness in School",
      "abstract": "People with shy temperaments or personalities tend to be anxious in social situations, especially those that are novel or in which they perceive social evaluation. The experience of shyness may include behavioural (e.g., inhibition, wariness, withdrawal), affective (e.g., anxiety, nervousness), somatic (e.g., racing heart), and/or affective-cognitive components (e.g., self-consciousness, worries about social-evaluation). Shyness is related to, but different from, solitude, social withdrawal, unsociability, social avoidance, and introversion. Although all these psychological constructs may manifest similarly in that they involve less social interaction, they differ in the motivations underlying the behaviour. Uniquely, shyness is thought to result from conflicting approach and avoidance motivations in social situations. Shyness is also related to, but different from social anxiety disorder (SAD), in part because SAD is more intense, pervasive across situations, and impairing. Shyness can be heritable. Researchers may have identified certain genetic polymorphisms associated with shyness. However, even if someone is born with a tendency to be shy, they might not actually become shy because shyness is also influenced by children's environments. Shyness has been associated with certain aspects of parenting, such as overly controlling and protective behaviours. Shyness also has been associated with aspects of peer relationships, such as rejection. However, researchers cannot determine whether these aspects of parenting and peer relationships are causes or consequences of shyness. Shy children may face difficulties in the school context. It has been related to numerous social and academic problems. Specifically, shy children may have problems in relationships with their peer group (e.g., poor acceptance), one-on-one friendships (e.g., poor friendship quality), and some aspects of their relationships with teachers (e.g., lower teacher–child closeness). In addition, shyness has been related to low school liking, and sometimes has been associated with aspects of poor school engagement and low academic achievement. Researchers and clinicians have investigated strategies to help shy or socially anxious children and adolescents avoid maladaptive socio-emotional or academic outcomes. For instance, children's social skills training in combination with parent education and training components is a promising way to improve social behaviours and reduce anxiety. School-based preventions and interventions that include parent and/or teacher components, such as FRIENDS for Life and INSIGHTS into Children's Temperament, also have been found to mitigate anxiety or improve shy children's engagement at school. Some treatments for social anxiety disorder, such as cognitive behavioural therapy may also help shy children.",

      "title": "Experiences of Sexual Violence Myth Following Different Types of Sexual Violence",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence myth has a substantial influence on the occurrence/overcoming/signifying of, and response to sexual assault. This study starts from a critical view on how victims of sexual violence experience misconception in different relationships and under different conditions. We surveyed 235 victims and conducted 14 in-depth interviews to look into how they experience sexual violence myth depending on their relationship with perpetrators, their age when the incident took place, and whether the incident was rape or not. The results show that victims are more vulnerable to sexual violence myth during investigation or court trial, by people around them and media, especially when the victims are adult women, and they knew/were close with/went on dates with/had drinks with the perpetrators on their own will. Victims of sexual aggression by stranger or rape are relatively less prone to experience rape myth in which their sufferings are questioned, denied, downplayed, and even attributed to them. Damages of sexual violence cannot be measured objectively by its types. It varies depending on the relationships and circumstances surrounding the incident. Therefore, no one but the victim can define the damage and its significance for each case. Nonetheless, rape myth instigated by family members, acquaintances, and media, often during investigation/trial procedures, assumes that feelings suffered by victims/women such as discomfort, anger, false accusation, and betrayal, can be easily edited and altered. Impacts of sexual assault are not a matter to be accepted based on biased social misconceptions. It should be about how much the society can empathize with the challenges that victims/women face.",

Third, natural poverty caused by the inadequate natural condition, such as the lack natural resources or the disadvantage of geographical condition.

Often called “reproductive tourism” but it is “reproductive exile” Existed for many years before fertility treatment-Irish women going to England for abortion. Why? Either unavailable or more affordable. Avoid legal, religious, or ethical restrictions Do we want to encourage breaking the laws of home? Do we encourage exploitation of poor donors/surrogates? Do we want to encourage avoidance of record keeping of donors? CONCERNS Health and safety Legal difficulties, e.g., passport for child Exploitation Children as a “commodity” Children abandoned e.g., Abnormalities SAFEGUARDS Balance rights of individuals against rights of children Need global guidelines/laws- UNTIL THEN; BAN CBRC. Motion: Against Cross-border reproductive care (CBRC) has become a dynamic global phenomenon encompassing various fertility treatments and practices, including surrogacy, embryo donation, age limit, marital status, cost considerations, advanced technology, support systems, known clinician or clinic preference, frozen embryo use, international job transfers, sex selection, PGTA restrictions, and restrictions on the number of embryos transferred. This debate revolves around the motion against banning CBRC, acknowledging its multifaceted nature and the need for comprehensive evaluation of its legal, ethical, and economic implications. CBRC has emerged as a lifeline for individuals facing restrictive reproductive laws in their home countries, offering hope and expanded choices for family building. Critics express concerns over potential exploitation, inadequate regulations, and safety risks associated with CBRC. Ethical dilemmas arise regarding patient autonomy, justice, and discrimination, particularly for LGBTQI individuals seeking fertility treatments in less legally restrictive countries. International organizations such as ESHRE, ASRM, ICMART, and IFFS have initiated efforts to collect data and set guidelines for CBRC. However, more work is needed to establish standardized data registries and harmonize laws to accurately assess the magnitude and scope of CBRC worldwide. A balanced approach to CBRC involves collaborative global governance and cooperation to address challenges while upholding patient rights and ensuring responsible practices. Facilitating access to advanced fertility treatments and safeguarding against potential risks are paramount considerations in shaping the future of cross-border reproductive care. In conclusion, the complexities surrounding CBRC warrant thoughtful deliberation and international collaboration. Rather than imposing a blanket ban, an inclusive approach focusing on transparency, safety, and ethical considerations will foster a responsible and balanced implementation of cross-border reproductive care.",

      "title": "Informed consent, vulnerability and the risks of group-specific attribution",
      "abstract": "People in extraordinary situations are vulnerable. As research participants, they are additionally threatened by abuse or exploitation and the possibility of harm through research. To protect people against these threats, informed consent as an instrument of self-determination has been introduced. Self-determination requires autonomous persons, who voluntarily make decisions based on their values and morals. However, in nursing research, this requirement cannot always be met. Advanced age, chronic illness, co-morbidity and frailty are reasons for dependencies. These in turn lead to limited abilities or opportunities for decision-making and self-determination. Exclusion of vulnerable people from research projects would disadvantage them by not covering their needs, which would violate the ethical principles of justice and beneficence. Commonly, vulnerability is attributed to social groups. The consequence for individuals, attributed as belonging to such a vulnerable group, is that the principles of respect for autonomy, justice and beneficence are subordinated to the principle of non-maleficence, understood as avoiding the risk to cause more harm than good. In addition, group-specific attribution could lead to stigmatizing because labelling a person as deviation from a norm violates integrity. For clinical nursing research, the question arises how the protection of vulnerable people could be granted without compromising ethical principles. The concept of relational ethics provides a possible approach. It defines vulnerability as the relation between a person’s health status and the extent to which this person is dependent on the researcher and the research context. Vulnerability is not attributed solely to a person but to a situation, meaning the person is viewed in context. By combining vulnerability as a context-related and situational concept with existing approaches of informed consent, the different ethical principles can be balanced and preserved at every step of the research process.",

      "abstract": "A large number of couples who end up their reproductive career with only one child presents a serious problem for demographic trends of a region in which they reside. A question rarely posed is what kind of consequences that phenomenon has for a family climate and family dynamics of those families. An even more important question is what kind of consequences the same phenomenon has for personality development of a child who grows up as a single child. What kind of characteristics and what personality traits are more likely to develop in a child that grows without his/her siblings? The results of our research show that single children get better results on the tasks that require recognition of one?s own emotional states and motives of one?s own behavior than first born and second born children. However, single children score less favorably than first or second born on the tasks that require forecasting other people?s behavior. The explanation for this may be that single children are self-centered due to the lack of interaction with siblings. Other possible explanation may be a specific parenting style that a single child receives from his/her parents. This parenting style is uniquely different from parenting style that a second or third born child receives due to the unique situation created by the fact that he/she is a single child.",

      "title": "Just for kids? How the youth decarceration discourse endorses adult incarceration",
      "abstract": "This article lays bare three interrelated and previously overlooked pitfalls of calls to reduce or abolish youth incarceration. First, despite their anti-carceral semblance, such calls persistently portray the overwhelming majority of people in trouble with the law—namely, adults—as incorrigible, blameworthy, and therefore as deserving of punishment and imprisonment. Second, this ageist rhetoric often disregards adult vulnerability. Thus, despite adults’ greater medical vulnerability to the COVID-19 disease, it is youth whom some organizations singled out or even called to prioritize for release from prisons during the coronavirus pandemic. Third, at the heart of the youth decarceration discourse are essentialist assumptions about youth, which rest on questionable science and downplay the socially constructed dimension of age differences. All three pitfalls epitomize a dual fault of the child rights discourse more broadly, as evidenced in other contexts: repeatedly lending legitimacy to punitiveness and apathy toward adults while also working to the detriment of children. Doubtless, there are compelling arguments against penal confinement, but it is only decarceration across the age spectrum that can truly challenge carceral thinking—and ageism.",

Scientists have learned that very young infants experience shame (as a personal feeling of unworthiness and shame), when they experience rejection-even if it is unintentional. Children, who are admonished for doing something over which they have limited or no control, are also capable of feeling shame. On a more serious, long-lasting scale, physical and sexual abuse and other traumatic experiences, particularly those that happen directly to the child, without adequate intervention, may lead to the development of shame as well. Considering the origin of the shame-wound is critical as well. If one is the child of abusive and/or addicted parents, their shame could have been an emotional and psychological transplant. Assessing if the shame is a consequence of actions, inactions, or someone elses conflicts, can allow for internal conflict resolution.",

      "abstract": "People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are perceived as helpless, dependent, and unable to fulfil social roles assigned to the so-called able-bodied1 people. As a consequence, the entrance of the said group into adulthood is impeded and delayed. It is not for the lack of will on the part of the subject or as a consequence of intellectual disability, but rather as a result of the existing social situations which create barriers hindering the fulfilment of needs. A person with ID has a right to have needs and fulfil them. Among them there are specific needs – shaped by individual human characteristics, experiences, and development changes – which are related to the particular stage of the individual’s development. The aim of this research was to diagnose the specific needs of adults with intellectual disabilities at a moderate and severe level, while the main research problem consists of the following questions: what are the specific needs of adults with intellectual disabilities at a significant level (moderate and severe) between the ages of 18 and 35? Which of the indicated needs are being met by the research participants? The research was conducted by employing a quantitative strategy, using the author´s self-designed survey questionnaire. 96 people with intellectual disabilities were surveyed – the participants of the occupational therapy workshop (OTW). An analysis was conducted on the needs which, according to Erikson, most commonly manifest in adulthood (between the ages of 18 and 35). The test results reveal the actual state of their occurrence and fulfilment.",

      "abstract": "Juvenile delinquency is a complex problem through the ages, and the tendencies toward delinquency basically appears, to a great extent, to be influenced by and learned simultaneously from the environment. The primary environment is the family. Within the family the adolescent ie interacting mainly with his parents, but in many cases also with other family members. obtains the material of values from his environment, moving from heteronomous to autonomous morality. When the socialization process of the Ego strength and the Superego does not develop adequately, it tends to create more opportunities for the adolescent to act delinquency. The tendencies toward delinquency and the actual delinquent behavior are partly related to the psycho sexual aspects of personality development at various phases during childhood, and also to the choice of libidinal object. The environment may facilitate or hamper the a-chievement of excellence, which in turn may influence the formation of morality. To be sure if the moral norms are inconsistently experienced they may induce the development of tendencies toward delinquency. In a complex pattern of social interactions the adolescent may not be able to acquire his self identity. In the process of social inter -action various physical conditions may contribute to the tendency toward delinquency",

      "title": "Social and Environmental Determinants of Health Among People With Disabilities",
      "abstract": "There is extensive evidence that people with disabilities experience significantly poorer health than their nondisabled peers. These are, in part, health inequities (differences in health status that are avoidable, unjust, and unfair) resulting from increased rates of exposure of people with disabilities to a range of well-established social (and environmental) determinants of poor health, including poverty, reduced access to effective education, lack of employment or employment under hazardous or precarious conditions, social disconnectedness, violence, discrimination, and poor healthcare. They also include environmental determinants of poor health that are a direct result of human activity (e.g., outdoor air pollution resulting from industrial processes and transportation). In addition, people with disabilities are often less likely than their peers to have access to many of the resources (power, wealth, social support, problem-solving skills) that have been linked to increased resilience in the face of adversity. As such, it would appear reasonable to expect that the health of people with disabilities is as likely, if not more so, to deteriorate, when exposed to social determinants, than the health of their nondisabled peers. Future research needs to focus on two key issues. First, given that most of the current evidence has been generated in high-income countries, it is critical for future research to focus on the situation of people with disabilities living in middle- and low-income countries. Second, more needs to be known about the determinants of the resilience and/or vulnerability of people with disabilities. Some significant limitations remain in the current evidence base, but it is clear that existing knowledge is sufficient to drive and guide changes in policy and practice that could reduce the health inequities faced by people with disabilities. These include (a) improving the visibility of people with disabilities in local, national, and international health surveillance systems; (b) making “reasonable accommodations” to the operation of healthcare systems to ensure that people with disabilities are not exposed to systemic discrimination in access to and the quality of healthcare; and (c) ensuring that people with disabilities are included in and benefit equally from local and national strategies to reduce population levels of exposure to well-established social determinants of health.",

      "abstract": "The term sexual minority youth (SMY) encompasses youth who are not exclusively heterosexual. These are youth whose sexual orientations, identities, and/or behaviors are not exclusively heterosexual. Sexual identity is one’s personal identity as a sexual being, a label used in regard to oneself, such as “gay,” “lesbian,” “queer,” “pansexual,” or “asexual.”1 Sexual identity may not be indicative of sexual behaviors and, thus, understanding both identity and behavior are essential to providing excellent care— particularly as SMY youth often face health disparities.2 SMY youth, like their heterosexual peers, have strengths and vulnerabilities. Although the majority of sexual minority children and adolescents do well, they are likely to experience mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidality at higher rates than their heteronormative peers.1,3 This phenomenon may be due to stigma, microaggressions, victimization, and/or discrimination regarding their sexual identities, which in turn effects overall health.4 In a 2013 survey performed by the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network, 55% of sexual and gender minority youth surveyed stated that they felt unsafe at school due to perceived/experienced harassment from peers.5 This harassment can lead to an increase in suicidal ideation and attempts6 due to internalized shame and stigma, social isolation, and conflict about their identities. Microaggressions, stigma, and shame may also be experienced at home and in the community. Healthcare providers are in a unique position to support minority youth across multiple domains if they are aware and informed of social supports and experiences of conflict.",

      "abstract": "Ageing is a genetically programmed physiological process that is accompanied by certain age-related changes in the human psyche. The complex and contradictory nature of human ageing is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes in the biological structures. When changes in the personality of an old person are assessed, more often than not negative features are mentioned; however, positive changes in his or her intellectual-mental sphere must also be taken into account. Impaired performance in intellectual tests in the elderly may be linked not to a drop in mental abilities but with a loss of interest in trivial tasks of a formal-logical nature and a shift to different semantic content virtually not addressed by conventional tests. In addition, it should be particularly emphasized that all tests of the intellectual integrity of an elderly person only include questions related to the cognitive sphere, and do not contain questions from the creative sphere. And it is in the latter, in particular, where an elderly person often has significant advantages over younger age groups. Features of human mental development in old age are made up of several closely related factors, due to changes in the biosocial status of a person. The ageing process can, in certain elements, be controlled, and the intelligent participation of the individual in maintaining psychological health in the period of gerontogenesis should be increased.",

Sexuality is one of the key components of the physical, intellectual and psychosocial well-being of an individual. Patient-centered approaches are used to define 'normal' or 'healthy' sexuality. Disruption in any phase of the sexual response cycle is considered sexual dysfunction. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in mental illness is very high. The disease process by itself as well as the medication used in treatment both contribute to the increased prevalence of sexual dysfunction. The estimated prevalence of sexual dysfunction in people suffering from depression is around 70-80% in various studies. Patients suffering from Alzheimer's and related dementia have a multitude of sexual problems, which include sexual apathy, sexually inappropriate behavior, decreased sexual desire and inappropriate sexual behavior, causing disrupted marital relationships.",

      "abstract": "Occupational Health (OH) is dedicated not only to prevent diseases but also to promote health in its global dimension, including the spiritual wellbeing. This dimension must not be confused with mental wellbeing or religious beliefs, since it refers to intangible assets and deep feelings such as ethics, compassion, dignity, tolerance, engagement, inclusiveness, sustainability and individual growth among others. In this respect, spirituality is complementary to the other dimensions of wellbeing at work such as the physical, mental and social ones. Though this dimension has not been much studied in the field of Occupational Health up to now, it is more and more an emerging demand from people willing to give sense to their life by allowing these intangible assets to become factors of their wellbeing at work and in their private life. Surveys in Europe have shown that the young generation prefers a meaningful job than a lucrative one. The meaningfulness of work strongly depends on its coherence with the fundamental values of individuals. Moreover, it has been shown that the 'Sense of Coherence', the basic concept of Salutogenesis – science focusing on factors that support human health and well-being, rather than on factors that cause disease – is closely linked with 'good health' and implicitly related to spiritual values of individuals. Therefore, it becomes more and more obvious that OH has to open to this new field of research and to the transfer of these new factors into practice. And the Science of Management too has opened its research on its spiritual dimension for many years now, as illustrated by the Spiritual Division of their international Academy of Management. New forms of management focusing on care (benevolent leadership for example) belong to these emerging issues that OH should promote and develop since they contribute to set up healthy and productive workplaces.",

      "abstract": "Health inequities are disparities which can be avoided through rational actions on the part of policymakers. Such inequalities are unnecessary and unjust and may exist between and within nations, societies, and population groups. Social determinants such as wealth, income, occupation, education, gender, and racial/ethnic groups are the principal drivers of this inequality since they determine the health risks and preventive behaviors, access to, and affordability of health care. Within this framework, there is a debate on assigning a personal responsibility factor over and above societal responsibility to issues of ill health. One school of philosophy argues that when individuals are worse-off than others for no fault of their own, it is unjust, as opposed to health disparities that arise due to avoidable personal choices such as smoking and drug addiction for which there should (can) be a personal responsibility. Opposing thoughts have pointed out that the relative socioeconomic position of an individual dictates how his/her life may progress from education to working conditions and aging, susceptibility to diseases and infirmity, and the consequences thereof. The existence of a social gradient in health outcomes across populations throughout the world is a testimony to this truth. It has been emphasized that assuming personal responsibility for health in public policy-making can only have a peripheral place. Instead, the concept of individual responsibility should be promoted as a positive concept of enabling people to gain control over the determinants of health through conscious, informed, and healthy choices.",

      "title": "Perceived discrimination experiences and social well-being among midlife and older adult men who have sex with men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study",
      "abstract": "Many men who have sex with men (MSM) in midlife (40-64 years) and older adulthood (65+ years) have survived a lifetime fighting and advocating for equality given exposures to social discrimination attributed to stigmatized social identities (e.g., sexual orientation, racial/ethnic minority, and HIV-positive status). Few public health research efforts have given attention to how MSM’s exposure and salience of social discrimination across the life course have shaped social well-being in midlife and older age. Three studies were conducted using a cross-sectional healthy aging sub-study of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Study 1 explored whether older adulthood, racial/ethnic minorities, and HIV+ serostatus were associated with higher prevalence of any lifetime, any sexuality-related, and multifactorial (number of discrimination types) discrimination. Non-Hispanic Blacks were associated with greater any lifetime discrimination (aOR=1.42, p<0.001) and associated with less sexuality-related discrimination (aOR=0.56, p=0.001) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. There was a statistically significant interaction associated to multifactorial discrimination between Non-Hispanic Black identity and HIV serostatus (aOR=0.46, p=0.019). Interestingly, no statistically significant differences in discrimination were observed by age cohort. Study 2 examined current internalized homophobia by discrimination exposure and salience. We observed no statistically significant differences in internalized homophobia by any discrimination or salience variables. Study 3 assessed differences in six indicators of social well-being (attachment, social integration, guidance, reassurance of worth, reliable alliance, and opportunity for nurturance) by discrimination exposure and salience. Though the mean scores for social well-being indicators were high overall, both any lifetime discrimination and multifactorial discrimination were negatively associated with indicator scores except opportunity for nurturance. Sexuality-related discrimination was negatively associated with social integration only. Across all discrimination salience variables, participants who reported discrimination and no/low salience exhibited lower scores on social well-being indicators than participants who reported no discrimination. Study 3 extended the public health literature on aging MSM, elucidating the role of salience on discrimination’s relationship to social well-being and that despite social adversity, these men have been able to maintain or achieve high social well-being. Future research should continue exploring midlife and older adult MSM’s resiliencies to identify factors that interrupt the deleterious impact of discrimination on health.",

ISD is multicausal and multidimensional and manifests differently for males and females. Precipitating factors include traumatic sexual experiences, negative self-image, sexual guilt or shame, deviant or variant sexual behavior, relationship difficulties, and a chronic sexual dysfunction. Regardless of whether the male or female experiences ISD, the effect on the couple is that the cycle of positive anticipation, pleasure-oriented intercourse, and a regular rhythm of sexual contact is replaced by anticipatory anxiety, unsuccessful intercourse, self-consciousness, and avoidance. This article outlines a therapeutic plan for establishing resilient sexual desire by emphasizing intimacy, pleasure, satisfaction, and realistic sexual expectations.",

Previous literature has, however, primarily investigated first heterosexual sex, overlooking important contextual factors specific to same-sex/gender sexual experiences. Seventeen in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority (LGB+) individuals, ages 18-23 years. Four themes emerged from thematic analysis of reported thoughts, affect, and behavior. First, participants reported difficulty defining sex between same-sex/gender partners, especially women who reported that this undermined their personal relationships and identity. Second, participants met partners through several means; however, it was almost exclusively men who reported meeting their first partners online. Third, motivations for first same sex/gender sex included affirmation of personal sexual identity, sexual exploration, social expectation, and spontaneity. Fourth, participants felt underprepared for their first same-sex/gender sex, noting that their earlier sex and relationship education had not included information on same-sex/gender sex or LGB+ identities. Consequently, participants reported relying on experienced partners and seeking information on the internet, including pornography and social media. Greater cultural representation and more comprehensive sex education that recognizes sexual diversity is needed to better prepare LGB+ young people for early sexual encounters.",

      "title": "Suffering among Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract Suffering is a pervasive part of the human condition. From social, cultural, and medical perspectives, human suffering is often hidden under an assortment of other defined experiences, for example, colonization, marginalization, stigmatization, or illness symptomatology such as physical, mental, or chronic pain. As such, a focused examination of the condition of human suffering as a distinct entity has often been lacking. However, work in several disciplines within recent years has brought a specific focus to suffering as an object of study. As part of this effort, research has also centered on the experience of suffering in later life. Suffering can be defined as immersion in a profoundly difficult or troubling event or episode. Of critical significance to an understanding of suffering – and what makes it different from many negative experiences – is that suffering often provides a challenge to personal identity and threatens a stable sense of who one is in the world. Six negative factors relating to suffering may each form the basis of a more profound level of existential suffering. Some research on suffering in later life has focused on the relationship of suffering to both personal meaning and the experience of control.",

First, with the passage of time, progressively diminished physical reserves are an inevitable part of aging, but, of course, the rate at which these diminished reserves occur is variable. Second, physical health can involve experiencing the biological ravages of age without feeling sick. Third, age and social class are important. The mission of positive aging is to add more life to years, not just more years to life. Results of the Study of Adult Development show that much of a septuagenarian's positive aging or lack of it is determined by controllable factors established before the age of 50. Seven factors that predict positive aging are not being a smoker, adaptive coping style, absence of alcohol abuse, healthy weight, stable marriage, exercise, and more years of education.",

Inappropriate sexual behavior (a common cause of disruption among children who are hospitalized for psychiatric disorders) may be caused either by hypersexuality or by simply ill-regulated behavior: a definition of hypersexuality is proposed that can be applied at the bedside (namely, sexual behaviors or fantasies that have abruptly increased in frequency by comparison with a previous baseline, are of sufficient excessiveness to disrupt expected or usual social, academic, or occupational functioning, or constitute a source of distress), so that this distinction can be made promptly, and we present a differential diagnosis for hypersexuality to direct its evaluation. Virilization does not seem to be a common cause of hypersexuality in children and adolescents, but it should not be overlooked when it does exist.The differential diagnosis of hypersexuality in adults, which we present for comparison, is much larger than it is in children.",

Some have thought of defining paedophilia not as a form of perversion but as 'social corruption', as it is considered a perversion only in certain societies or historical periods, whereas in others it is an absolutely natural behaviour.",

Abusive siblings are often displaying problematic sexual behaviours or developmentally inappropriate behaviours that may be the result of victimisation they have encountered themselves—either witnessed or experienced. Abused siblings often do not disclose being abused due, among other things, to fear of not being believed, fear of upsetting parents, or confusion over their role in the abuse.

      "abstract": "Sexually active teenage girls tend to wait at least a year before commencing contraceptive use, but half of all adolescent pregnancies occur within 6 months of the onset of sexual activity. To promote contraceptive use among adolescents and prevent unwanted pregnancy, an understanding of adolescent cognitive development is necessary. It has been suggested that many teenagers become pregnant not as a result of a lack of information, but because they lack the cognitive and behavioral skills needed to use the information. The major cognitive task in adolescence--formal operational thinking--involves the ability to analyze situations and hypothesize outcomes. According to Paiget, the capacity to imagine the future and act accordingly begins to emerge at about 11 years of age. However, many teenagers fail to develop this ability to think beyond the present and remain immersed in sexual fantasies when it comes to the area of sexuality. Since they are unable to conceptualize pregnancy and childbearing, they fail to use contraception. Moreover, adolescents commonly believe that they are not at risk of pregnancy the 1st few times they have sexual intercourse and are generally immune from the negative consequences of personal actions. Group discussions and role playing appear to be particularly effective tools to help adolescents speculate on the possible results of engaging in various sexual behaviors and stimulate cognitive development to advance from a concrete to a formal operational level.",

During adolescence, learning of social behaviors is frequently dominated by interactions with peer clusters. There are a number of additional postulates: 1) The strength of the bonds between the youth and the primary socialization sources is a major factor in determining how effectively norms are transmitted. 2) Any socialization link can transmit deviant norms, but healthy family and school systems are more likely to transmit prosocial norms. 3) Peer clusters can transmit either prosocial or deviant norms, but the major source of deviant norms is usually peer clusters. 4) Weak family/child and/ or school/child bonds increase the chances that the youth will bond with a deviant peer cluster and will engage in deviant behaviors. 5) Weak peer bonds can also ultimately increase the changes of bonding with deviant peers. Primary socialization theory is consistent with current research, has strong implications for improving prevention and treatment, and suggests specific hypotheses for further research.",

      "title": "Unconscious bias",
      "abstract": "FigureHave you ever walked into a patient room with a preconceived picture based on socioeconomic status or ethnicity? Have you feared taking care of someone because he or she is homeless or has opioid use disorder? Although we're caregivers and have devoted our lives to helping people, we sometimes display unintentional biases toward others. Everyone has a cultural lens through which we view the world, which can sometimes create biases. Often, the decisions we make are directly influenced by those biases, even when we espouse other beliefs. The influence occurs without our knowledge because unconscious bias is just that—unconscious—and research has revealed that we all harbor unconscious biases. What's unconscious bias? Unconscious, or implicit, bias is defined as stereotypes or cultural concepts that influence decisions and behaviors. These biases started forming when you were very young and were shaped as you matured into who you are today. Investigations of unconscious bias show that people of all backgrounds, despite claims against partialities, have unconscious preferences based on gender, race, sexual orientation, or other aspects of identity. We also classify people according to educational level, disability, sexuality, accent, social status, and job title, automatically assigning presumed traits to anyone we subconsciously put in those groups. Further research supports that our unconscious biases, and the decisions they cause us to make, may contribute to healthcare disparities (see What does healthcare disparity mean?). Despite our strong ethical and moral commitment to others, our biases have a significant impact on nursing practice and the nation's health. Even if you're aware of unconscious bias, your reaction to your patient sets the tone for his or her care. Your body language, focused attention, or level of care can be directly impacted by your feelings toward the patient. Understanding what may trigger your reactions to people and what makes you act differently can improve the way you provide care. Identifying our biases No one wants to feel like they make decisions based on unconscious bias. In fact, most of us get very defensive if someone accuses us of stereotyping or making a biased comment. However, we must accept that we all have a different lens to view the world, and that lens impacts how we see each other and, ultimately, how we care for others. Making decisions based on prejudices can have devastating impacts on nursing care. The first step in addressing the impact of unconscious bias is identifying your own biases. The process begins with recognizing that words and feelings can cause uncomfortable feelings toward others. You need to be honest with yourself about the stereotypes that affect you. For example, you may consciously think that men and women are equally effective leaders but, as a woman, you believe that men perhaps don't have the same level of empathy as women. As we've seen, people may unwittingly tend to favor physicians or nurses from their own backgrounds. Likewise, you may favor caring for someone from your own familiar background. Neurologic tests and exercises, such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which was introduced in 1998 and has now been used by more than 15 million participants, can help you identify your unconscious biases and reduce their influence. The test measures the time it takes to match representatives of social groups to particular attributes. There are more than a dozen IATs that you can take online to gauge your perceptions of ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, disability, skin tone, weight, religion, and more. Once you've identified your biases, you're prepared to move to the next step: acknowledging unconscious bias. Acknowledging unconscious bias Do you know how your unconscious biases affect your nursing care? Acknowledging your biases can be done individually or in a group. You can choose the most comfortable way to approach this step. However, make sure you're in a safe place if you're doing this with someone else. To begin, we must eliminate the stigma around talking about biases. Doing so may seem like common sense, but it can be difficult if you don't have the tools or desire to acknowledge that we all have biases. Part of making a concerted effort to eliminate prevailing bias is working together. Leaders and coworkers must feel empowered to call out or interrupt bias language. For example, when a nurse says, \"I don't want to take care of that nagging, old lady,\" fellow coworkers should interrupt the conversation and state, \"You mean Mrs. Smith.\" Many times, we don't realize the bias in our language. Nursing is considered one of the most trusted professions, and the last thing you want to do is allow biases to impact your patient. Remember that every action you take and decision you make also creates a stigma about yourself in the patient's eyes. Strategies to disengage biases The next question you should ask yourself is: Do I want to honestly address my biases? As nurses, we hope the answer is \"yes!\" It's important to remember that you aren't trying to change your unconscious bias, but rather disengage it while caring for patients. Biased decisions often occur under stressful situations, which is most of our bedside nursing careers. Disengaging your unconscious bias takes honesty, practice, and intentional thought. First, write down your commitment to the action you'll take to disengage a specific bias you've identified. For example, \"I won't address the new graduate nurses as 'baby' nurses.\" Next, you must unpack your level of consciousness. The honest conversation with ourselves must include a shift from feeling like we're very tolerant to a focus on being the nurse we mean to be. You can start by challenging yourself to stop using a few common biased words, such as frequent flyer, bossy, baby nurses, old nurses, or any other words that don't tastefully describe your coworkers or patients. Another way to identify your bias is to ask yourself this question: \"Would I address my patient by this name or description to their face?\" If the answer is \"no,\" you're probably using biased language. As healthcare professionals, we must be able to empathize with our patients and their circumstances to fully disengage our biases. You can develop empathy by making a conscious effort to understand the patient's situation. Try to imagine walking in the patient's footsteps. Some biases are more difficult to disengage than others, and this takes intentional practice. However, remember that your biases can raise a barrier to empathy. For example, caring for patients who participate in risk-taking behaviors can make it more difficult for you to be empathetic. To overcome these barriers, you must consciously make an effort to recognize and acknowledge that the barriers exist and deliberately implement a practice that aligns with unbiased patient care. Another strategy to overcome our unconscious bias is mindfulness—the ability to empty the mind of distracting thoughts so that we can focus on the present moment. When we're being mindful, we free ourselves of the distraction of assumptions. Your patients should be able to sense that you intend to do what's best for them to provide safe outcomes. Educating yourself, aside from this article, is essential to changing your bias. Many educational opportunities exist, such as implicit bias webinars, diversity training in your facility, or formal courses on diversity in healthcare. Be the change Although many healthcare professionals don't see themselves as being biased, our patients may be negatively impacted because of our unconscious bias. Education can be introduced in the formal curriculum for healthcare providers and nurses. However, change starts with us—the front line of care for our patients. What does healthcare disparity mean? Healthcare disparity is defined as a particular type of health difference that's closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage and adversely effects different groups. People who experience the greatest disparities include those who've incurred obstacles at the system level based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic status; gender; age; mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. Examples of healthcare disparities include: Rates of premature death from stroke and coronary heart disease are higher among nonHispanic Black individuals when compared with White individuals. The infant mortality rate for nonHispanic Black women is more than double the rate for nonHispanic White women. on the webFigureNational Institutes of Health:https://diversity.nih.gov/sociocultural-factors/implicit-bias Project Implicit:https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html re:Work:https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/unbiasing Very Well Mind:www.verywellmind.com/negative-bias-4589618",

      "abstract": "This study examines the relationship among levels of spirituality, religiosity, shame, and guilt on sexual attitudes and experiences. A convenience sample that included graduate and undergraduate students (N = 176; mean age = 37) completed a five-factor measure of personality as well as measures of spirituality, religiosity, shame, guilt, and sexual attitudes and experiences. Spirituality was negatively correlated with sexual permissiveness, and engaging in high risk sex. The moral emotion of shame increased when people had multiple sex partners within the past three months while those more spiritual or connected to God were less likely to have had sex after use of alcohol and/or drugs. Also, the more often someone attended religious services the less likely they were to have had multiple partners within the past three months. A sense of alienation from God predicted shame and guilt, but shame and guilt themselves did not predict sexual practices. These findings suggest that sexual attitudes and experiences are related to both spirituality and religious practices independently of personality, whereas they have no relationship to shame and guilt.",

      "abstract": "The UN Convention on the Child 's Rights stipulates that the right of every child is to grow up in a family where it feels safe, loved and protected. Family should be a place of happiness, security and mutual respect for every child. The problem of negligence of children has exsisted in every civilization and culture, and over the years there has been a great improvement in that area that today every negative and adverse consequences which affect the child and its development is being recognized. The most common types of family violence over children are: physical abuse, emotional (psychological) abuse, sexual abuse and neglection. Physical violence against children usually leaves visible physical marks, and it is therefore easier to identify than other forms. It is characterized by a bad intention to harm the\r\nchild and to cause physical injury. Consequences of pyhsical abuse can be short-term as well as long-term. They are usualy manifested in neurological and intelectual area, shool success, life expectations, socioemootional development and social realations, but also mental health in general. Emotional violence occurs primarily as parents long-term failure to show love and attention to the child. The consequences can be expressed trough many different areas: learning problems, difficulties in establishing interpersonal relationships, inappropriate behavior in ordinary situations, general depressed mood and dissatisfaction, frequent psychosomatic ailments etc. Sexual violence, on the other hand, includes every unwanted sexual contact and relationship in which a child is forced against their will. It leaves devastating consequences on children. Apart from pysical integrity, sexual abuse affects childs mental health, trust toward adults trusting adults and their selfrespect. Fear,depression, bad image of their body, sexual problems, poor achivements and other, are being expressed. The least attention is given to negligence because, unlike other forms of violence it leaves no\r\nvisible physical consequences. Negligence of children in their early age, during childhood, has severe and destructive consequences on their further development to be and is also a great cause of short-term and long-term emotional, cognitive, social and educational problems. Resarch proves that ignoring children during their childhood affects their development of personality disorder in adolescent and adult age. Many authors and associations have studied\r\nthe impact of violence on child development. In every case, violence negatively and adversely affects the cognitive, emotional and social development of the child and at the same time limits it, sometimes even leaving lifelong consequences.",

      "title": "IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT",
      "abstract": "This chapter discusses identity development in adolescence. Adolescence is the stage of the life cycle that is most crucial in the crystallization of identity. Identity as a concept refers to a collection of traits and personal characteristics. Traits are habitual patterns of behavior, such as honesty/dishonesty, happiness/sadness, or intelligence/stupidity. Personal characteristics include physical attributes, such as height, color of hair and eyes, and condition of skin; and background factors, such as ethnic-group membership and religion. Because identity is so central to psychological functioning, it is important throughout the life cycle. Identity in adolescence is shaped by resolutions of earlier crises and will evolve further in later stages. Infancy and childhood are important because they result in identifications and identity elements that contribute to the resolution of the adolescent crisis of identity. These early stages are preludes to the central normative crisis of identity in adolescence. When an adolescent makes commitments contributing to an adult identity, particularly occupational decisions, before having a chance to experiment freely with possible roles, the sense of identity that results has no proper foundation. Such an identity results from commitment before the experience of an identity crisis has run its course.",

Bullying is not the kind of abuse that leaves broken bones; rather, it is a dehumanizing experience that manifests itself in the form of rumor spreading, name calling, psychological manipulation, character assassination, and social exclusion. Female teachers who are former victims of girl bullies or who themselves have been complicit with girl-to-girl bullying, consistently casting a blind eye to this ritualized social degradation, allowing it to continue generation after generation. The purpose here is not to blame teachers, but rather to seek an answer to What are the social or institutional forces that prevent adults in the schools from seeing what they may have experienced themselves?",

      "abstract": "Violence is both a public health and a social problem. Although there is not only one type of violence nor a unique concept of what it means, the following concept has gained consensus, particularly among those working intersectorally with a public health approach: “Violence is an intentional use of physical force against another person or against oneself, which either result in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury or death”.1 This definition has two main components: the intention and the harm it produces. It is also focused on the event itself: hence it is either case or victim oriented, as in many public health situations. Its usefulness relies upon the possibility of linking the case with the specific circumstances that led to or ended in violence.\n\nSome common cases are worth illustrating: a woman with bruises on her face; a child with a burn on their back; a young man with a firearm generated wound, an adult killed in an assault on a bank. We ask ourselves: were they accidental? The answer is no. They were all intentionally inflicted. They were man/woman made, on purpose. So, the challenge for health professionals is not only to carry out a proper and adequate bandaging, stitching or operating on the cases who look for care at health facilities. Actually, the challenge goes beyond the emergency unit. The challenge is how to develop preventive interventions to avoid the occurrence of cases such as these.\n\nIn doing so, there are many problems to face. To start with, it is necessary to state that good and reliable data, to measure the burden and trend of the problem, are required worldwide. Although the data are not complete, it has been established that the Americas has the highest rate of homicide in the world, higher …",

      "abstract": "Adolescent suicide is today a public health problem among the leading cause of mortality among adolescents and young adults. There seems to be many reasons for this increase (which has different trends in different populations), but associations have been found with increased substance abuse, television and video violence, socio-economic status and easy access to firearms. Gender differences have also been observed with crime, suicide and substance abuse higher among males, while eating disorder, depression and suicidal behavior more prevalent among females. This paper will review prevalence and incidence of adolescent suicidal behavior, socio-demographic and psychological risk factors, associated cognitive factors and socio-economic factors. Risk factors include previous suicide attempts, a history of others in the family who have been suicidal, mental illness, alcohol and drug use, and other self-destructive behaviors as well as consideration being given to hopelessness, hostility, negative self-concept and isolation. At the individual difference level, factors such as trait depression, anger and hostility, perfectionism and social sensitivity would seem critical variables, as would age, gender and intellectual functioning. Sociological and family-related factors may also be implicated including dysfunctional family organizations, a history of physical or psychological abuse (sexual abuse) and limited extent of social support networks. A frequently reported precipitating event of suicidal behavior is family adversity including rejection, separation and interpersonal conflict. At a socio-economic level it would seem essential to provide comprehensive document about the social and economic conditions from which the adolescent comes.",

Dalam berbagai kasus pencabulan atau kekerasan seksual lainya, sering kali yang dipersalahkan adalah pihak korban. Pengertian cabul adalah sesutau yang melanggar kesusilaan yang dilakukan dengan perbuatan-perbuatan. Bagi pelaku pencabulan dan pemerkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur ini sering disebut dengan istilah phedofilia yaitu suatu suatu istilah dari ilmu kejiwaan yaitu phedofil yang artinya dapat disimpulkan ialah melampiaskan hasrat seksual kepada anak-anak. Pada faktor kejiwaan yang menyimpang inilah yang merupakan salah satu faktor yang mempengaruhi terjadinya tindak pidana perkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur. Penyebab penyakit Phedofilia ini sangat bervariasi ada yang berupa trauma sewaktu kecil akibat pernah disodomi ataupun ketidaksukaan terhadap orang dewasa akan tetapi lebih menyukai anak-anak di bawah umur dalam hal hubungan seksualnya.

Faktor-faktor yang dapat meningkatkan dan mempengaruhi terjadinya tindak pidana pencabulan dan pemerkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur yaitu factor lingkungan, faktor kebudayaan, faktor ekonomi, faktor media, dan factor psikologi atau kejiwaan pelaku. Dalam kasus ini pertimbangan hakim dalam menjatuhkan pidana adalah pertimbangan dari segi pembuktian perbuatan pidana dan berdasarkan pertimbangan sisi kebenaran formal (kenbenaran menurut hukum) di mana semua unsur dalam dakwaan telah dapat dibuktikan dan pertimbangan dari sisi kebenaran mutlak (kebenaran materil) seperti pengakuan terdakwa, alat bukti, keyakinan dalam diri hakim dan lain-lainnya.

It focuses on issues around identification, bi-negativity or biphobia, kin work, lack of support networks, gender relations and sexual practices. Many self-identified bisexuals hold the view that their identity is not dependent on their current relationship status or their sexual practice in any particular period of their life. Monogamous non-bisexual partners often create anxieties, if a bisexual person insists on maintaining a public bisexual identity. Differences in income and social and cultural capital create divisions in lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer families as much as in heterosexual relationships. Many bisexual people commit themselves to monogamous partnerships. Bisexuals who wish to be non-monogamous and polyamorous frequently have to negotiate a range of issues in their relationships. Common anti-bi sentiments complicate bisexual identification, bisexual coming or being 'out' and the maintenance of bisexual intimacies.",

Disability growth areas include diagnostic categories such as depression, anxiety disorders, anorexia, cancers, traumatic brain injuries, attention deficit disorder, autoimmune disease, spinal cord injuries, autistic spectrum disabilities and dementia. Yet disability, like any challenge or limitation, is fundamental to being human, a part of every life. Becoming disabled demands learning how to live effectively as a person with disabilities, not just living as a disabled person trying to become nondisabled. It also demands the awareness and cooperation of others who don't experience these challenges. Becoming disabled means moving from isolation to community, from ignorance to knowledge about who they are, from exclusion to access, and from shame to pride.",

      "title": "The duty to prevent handicaps: laws promoting the prevention of handicaps to newborns.",
      "abstract": "Lawmakers addressing the problem of legal rights of the handicapped traditionally have tended to focus on the legal rights afforded those persons already possessing certain physical or mental handicaps. Specifically, their focus has usually centered on either the rights of the handicapped to compensation, or their rights related to opportunities in employment, rehabilitation, or mobility. Commentators have paid little attention to the legal rights, if any, that may be opportunities in employment, rehabilitation, or mobility afforded those not yet handicapped, or to legal rights designed to prevent future handicaps. This failure is unfortunate because social policy favors the avoidance or elimination of handicaps wherever possible. This lack of commentary on the propriety of laws designed to prevent handicaps is particularly troublesome. Recent scientific advances have increased the understanding of the causes and prevention of many forms of physical and mental handicaps. Many of these advances involve handicaps that can be projected or discovered prior to birth, the prevention of which can be furthered by legal regulation of the various stages of life, or potential life, prior to live birth. While undoubtedly there has been tremendous growth in the legal rights of a handicapped infant through compensation from those responsible for the handicaps, and through other opportunities for a meaningful future life, further legal regulation is needed to prevent those handicaps which are reasonably certain to occur. Compensation for handicaps is not only less desirable than their prevention, but in many cases compensation is not presently available for preventable handicaps. In focusing on the means by which laws can prevent handicaps for future generations, at least four distinct inquiries should be made. First, attention must be paid to the type of conduct that can be subjected to legal regulation, that is, what constitutes unreasonable conduct or perhaps reasonable but unwarranted conduct toward the unborn? Second, note must be taken of the people who can be subjected to legal regulation, that is, who can be made legally responsible for their conduct toward the unborn? Third, consideration must be given to the appropriate type of legal regulator, that is, who can be made responsible for setting the standards of legally acceptable conduct toward the unborn? Fourth, inquiry must be pursued on the possible sanctions available for the violations of any legal regulations, that is, what happens to those who act irresponsibly toward the unborn? These inquiries should not be foreclosed or delayed because recent scientific advances provide less than definitive conclusions regarding the causes and means of preventing handicaps. While preliminary or tentative scientific findings counsel caution in the implementation of legal standards, there is currently much that can be done to prevent the costly and tragic and sometimes deadly burdens to the health and well-being of the citizenry prompted by the birth of handicapped newborns. As scientific and medical advances produce more definitive conclusions, the inquiries should quickly be made and legal action therefrom should promptly be implemented. There looms the prospect of unprecedented harm if the traditional lag or delay between scientific advance and legal change is tolerated.",

Psychiatric morbidity relating to male gender roles and gender-based societal expectations can be further influenced by ethnicity and race, as well as by sexual orientation. Social factors, including poverty, homelessness, and unemployment, can lead to poor self-esteem, which can contribute to distress and vulnerability. When confronted with adverse social circumstances, men tend to hide their emotions. Pathways into care can vary as often men are reluctant to seek help as part of what has been described as ‘toxic masculinity’. Some personality disorders, including dissocial personality, are more commonly reported in men. Rates of alcohol and substance misuse, as well as suicide, are generally higher among men, which may be attributed to externalizing behaviours. The symptoms of psychotic disorders are complex and presentations can differ across the sexes. Gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals are often bullied at school and also show high rates of psychiatric disorders. There must be changes at institutional and clinical care levels to ensure that men do not lose out when seeking help and responding to therapeutic needs.",

The child rights were either stressed specifically or implicitly included as rights concerning all human beings. The spectre of children’s rights is very wide, comprising, but not limited to, early development, education, health, recreation, physical, mental and spiritual development as well as protection against all kinds of exploitation, discrimination, cruelty and neglect. It is also constantly stressed that children should be entitled to these rights, without distinction or discrimination on account of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or opinion. More attention is often devoted to children with specific needs like girls, orphans, disabled and those belonging to minorities or living in countries under war and conflicts.

      "abstract": "The issue of studying social health in the context of the older generation involvement in social relations is relevant. We analyze numerous foreign studies on the correlation of social relations involvement, physical and mental health. Foreign studies on mortality in many industrialized countries consistently show that people with the least involvement in social ties are more likely to die than those who are more involved. Social connections affect health through behavioral, psychosocial and physiological mechanisms. Behavioral mechanisms are revealed through involvement in formal (for example, religious organizations) and informal (for example, friends and relatives) social ties. A link has been established with more positive health behaviors over a ten-year period. Psychosocial mechanisms are manifested through social support that promotes mental and physical health. Physiological mechanisms act through psychosomatic manifestations. Studies show that conflicted relationships or lack of social support can exacerbate the symptoms of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The concept of “social health” as one of the possible dimensions of social support is practically not represented in academic publications. The foreign concept of social health has not acquired the status of an academic scientific theory to date. This requires further research, including a systematic analysis of the literature, the development of clear definitions and the operationalization of key constructs.",

      "abstract": "Medieval persons showed nuanced awareness of human lifespan development. The familiar 'ages of man' texts generally followed one of three conceptual systems: the biologists' theory of three ages (youth, maturity, and old age); the physiologists' theory of four ages (childhood, youth, maturity, and old age), corresponding to the four humours, seasons, and elements; and the astrologers' theory of seven ages (infancy, childhood, adolescence, youth, maturity, old age, decrepitude) following the Ptolemaic structure of the universe. By the later Middle Ages a stable set of terms divided childhood into seven-year segments: infantia (infancy), pueritia (childhood), and adolescentia (adolescence). These demarcations were based primarily upon age but also considered the social, emotional, and mental development of the individual. Prior to the age of seven or infantia, an infant girl was not considered to be a fully rational and responsible agent. The transition to pueritia was marked by growing personal awareness and social accountability, and the move into adolescentia was marked by the onset of menarche and secondary sexual characteristics. At adolescentia, regarded as twelve for girls and fourteen for boys, young people could marry according to canon law or could break a marriage contract arranged in their childhood by paying a fine equivalent to the value of the marriage. Although remaining unmarried was a possibility, the life options available to most girls were limited to marriage, religious vocation, or some form of domestic employment or household management.

      "title": "Willing addicts? Drinkers, dandies, druggies, and other Dionysians",
      "abstract": "Abstract A willing addict is one who reflectively endorses their addiction. Some say that there are no willing addicts, only unwilling addicts who are trying to stop but not succeeding, or resigned addicts who are so demoralized they have stopped trying to stop. Willing addiction reminds us that addiction is a phenomenon that involves a person-with-a-lifestyle-inside-an-ecology, that there are good-making features of using even addictively, and that addiction involves many of the same complex, negotiated features (experiential, personal, interpersonal, structural, and cultural) of other person-level lifestyle choices. Willing addiction shows that concepts such as choice, voluntariness, and reflective endorsement have a place in the psychology and phenomenology of addiction. There are implications for the psych-bio-politics of addiction and for the implausible idea that addiction is a brain disorder. Addiction is not a brain disorder, although certain aspects or features of addiction involve brain disorders.",

      "abstract": "The world's population contains more young people than ever, with almost half under the age of 25 years. Millions every year enter their 'reproductive age'. Many do this in a safe and controlled way, and manage to balance life goals, education and sexual maturity as essential positive elements of human life. However, in developing countries, many young people are exposed to the increasing risks of unprotected sexual practice, such as exposure to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, other sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted or unplanned pregnancies, sexual abuse and rape, and mental health problems related to unwanted sexual exposures. Some, especially the poor and uneducated, enter into sexual activities without proper information or access to protective services. There are cultural and moral reasons for this lack of information. Worldwide, evidence demonstrates that informed young people demonstrate more protective behaviour than uninformed young people. This paper addresses how one can meet the reproductive rights of young clients, especially females, in a human rights and reproductive rights framework, as well as in clinical practice and also safeguard their health and ensure their sexual safety.",

Believing that one knows one’s own or certain others such measurements also may. Therefore the social sciences need to detect, avoid, and overcome these problems of reactivity to their measuring and measurements if they are to obtain valid measurements and generalizations from these. This requires the cooperation of the measured and so an understanding of the social psychology of measuring on such dimensions, of how persons participate in being measured on such dimensions and react to being informed about their own or some others measurements on these dimensions. These are matters that physical science measurement theory has no reason to be concerned with, is not, and so cannot properly provide a model for measurement of persons on social science dimensions.",

      "abstract": "Male chimpanzees experience puberty (marked testicular growth and ejaculation) when they are about 9 years old and just over half adult weight. They reach adult weight at 14-15 years. Females start small sexual swellings at about 8 years, mate with adult males when they are about 10.5 years and have their first infants when they are about 12 years. Males reduce their constant association with their mothers when they reach puberty and associate more with adult males and cycling females. Some males form strong, long-lasting associations with particular adult males. Females remain with their mothers until first oestrus,and then associate with adult males either in their natal community or a new community during oestrus. The decline in association with the mother is more closely correlated with pubertal stage than with chronological age in both sexes. Immatures of all ages spend 3-13% of their time in social grooming, but grooming partners change during adolescence. Juveniles of both sexes groom their mothers and siblings most, but males groom individuals outside their maternal unit more than do females. Juveniles receive over 90% of their grooming from mothers and siblings. Adolescent males groom less with their mothers and more with cycling females and adult males. While early adolescent males start to be groomed by females only late adolescent males receive any grooming from adult males. Adolescent females without mothers groom little except with adult males when they are in oestrus. Social play is most frequent with individuals aged 2-9 years and individuals play most with others of their age. Time spent playing by both sexes declines markedly during adolescence. Juveniles and early adolescents of both sexes have friendly interactions with infants, but late adolescents rarely interact with infants. Males show frequent sexual behaviour with oestrous females from an early age. Males spend more time with oestrous females as they get older but frequency of copulation declines gradually through adolescence. Early adolescent males try to take females on consort, but only late adolescent males succeed. One female rejected the sexual advances of a male once he reached puberty. Rates of interference in copulations by males decline during adolescence and males become more cautious of copulating in the presence of adult males. Females show little sexual behaviour until they start getting large oestrus swellings. Males receive increased aggression from adult males during adolescence. They become tense in the presence of adult males and even late adolescents are peripheral to grooming clusters of adult males. Males start to challenge adult females in adolescence but are often attacked, and are not able to dominate them all until late adolescence. Male juveniles perform elements of charging displays without hair erection more frequently than females. The freqency of this declines in adolescence while the frequency of charging displays with hair erection by males increases in adolescence and displays become increasingly more adult-like in length and form. Males show the shoulder hunch for the first time in early adolescence. Males pant hoot more than females and rates of pant-hooting increase with age in both sexes.",

Gre za pervazivne razvojne motnje, ki cloveka prizadenejo že v zgodnjem otrostvu in se pojavljajo skozi njegovo celotno življenje. Ljudje, ki jih prizadenejo spektroavtisticne motnje, imajo težave v komunikaciji, socialnih interakcijah, živijo v doloceni rutini ter kažejo pretirane interese za doloceno stvar. Veliko je bilo ugibanj, kaj sploh je razlog za pojav avtizma in kje so vzroki zanj. Nekateri znanstveniki so slednje iskali v genetiki, okolju, prehrani in tudi cepivih, vendar vse do danes natancni vzroki se niso znani. Zaradi vseh znacilnosti, ki jih imajo ljudje z motnjami avtisticnega spektra, se pogosto zgodi, da se taksni posamezniki znajdejo v kazenskem postopku, bodisi kot žrtve, price ali osumljenci. Pogosto se posamezniki z avtizmom ne zavedajo, da je njihovo vedenje v družbi nesprejemljivo in je lahko celo kaznivo. V primeru kaznivega dejanja se morajo v primer vkljuciti organi kazenskega pregona. Zanje je bistvenega pomena prepoznava in primeren odziv, saj je z avtisti zaradi njihovih znacilnosti potrebno ravnati drugace. Tudi v primeru zaslisanja se je avtisticni osebi potrebno prilagajati in se držati dolocenih nasvetov, kako zaslisanje voditi. V samem kazenskem postopku, v katerega so vpletene osebe z motnjami avtisticnega spektra, lahko pride do krsenja Miranda pravic. To se lahko zgodi zaradi posameznikovega nerazumevanja teh pravic. Za boljso osvescenost organov kazenskega pregona o avtizmu je potrebno dodatno izobraževanje in usposabljanje, ki ga v nekaterih državah sirom sveta že izvajajo.",

      "title": "Punishing Bias: An Examination of the Theoretical Foundations of Bias Crime Statutes",
      "abstract": "Bias crime statutes establish increased penalties for crimes committed because of race, color or religion. The Article examines various possible justifications for bias crime statutes to elucidate ways that thought in general, and bias in particular, may be relevant to punishment. The Article takes a generally retributivist perspective on punishment. Under retributivism, increased penalties are justified only for greater wrongfulness or greater culpability. Bias crimes might be considered intrinsically more wrongful than other crimes because they violate a person's interest in not being discriminatorily harmed. But such an interest implies an interest in another's thoughts inconsistent with established notions of autonomy. Alternatively, bias crimes might be considered contingently more wrongful because of their secondary effects on the victim's community and society. Uncertainties concerning under- and overinclusiveness, however, weigh against employing bias as a proxy for such effects. Mental states, such as intent, are traditionally relevant to culpability. Culpability, however, is a matter of an actor's attitude toward morally relevant features of an act or person. Bias is an attitude toward features, such as race and religion, that are morally irrelevant. Bias thus cannot increase culpability. Based on these analyses, the Article concludes that bias crime statutes are more problematic than generally recognized.",

      "abstract": "Although aggressive behaviours, and especially bullying, are regarded as socially undesirable, there is controversy as to whether they are also evidence of deficits on measures of social skills or social competence. Many measures of emotional intelligence and social competence include aspects of social desirability. However, theory of mind skills are neutral as regards social desirability and can be used for prosocial or antisocial ends. It has been proposed that children who bully others at school, especially ringleader bullies, may actually have and use good theory of mind skills. Nine studies were found that directly examined theory of mind in relation to roles involved in bullying in childhood. Of these, five found some positive association of theory of mind with bullying behaviors. In addition, some associations were found with defending behaviors, and negative associations with being a victim of bullying. These associations have been found to interact, in one or more studies, with type of bully, type of aggression, age, gender, and individual characteristics such as levels of narcissism and levels of victimization experience. Although the research base is limited, the evidence does support the view that theory of mind skills can be used for both prosocial (e.g. defending) and antisocial (e.g. bullying) ends, whereas it is the victims of bullying who may be more likely to be deficient in such skills.

      "abstract": "It has been suggested that there is a strong relationship between suicidal behavior and homosexuality in adolescence. It has been further suggested that it is due to the stigmatization and feelings of isolation that are experienced by many gay adolescents. Much of the literature that has given support to these hypotheses has been conducted on uncontrolled nonrepresentative samples and its generalizability is open to question. An opportunity to examine the relationship in an unselected sample arose in a case control, psychological autopsy study of 120 of 170 consecutive suicides under age 20 and 147 community age, sex, and ethnic matched controls living in the Greater New York City area. Homosexuality was defined as having had homosexual experiences or having declared a homosexual orientation. Three teenagers and no controls met these criteria. The difference was not significant. The circumstances of death were examined and are described. In no instance did suicide directly follow an episode of stigmatization. All three suicides had evidence of significant psychiatric disorder before death. In spite of opportunities for biased reporting, it is concluded that this study finds no evidence that suicide is a common characteristic of gay youth, or that when suicide does occur among gay teenagers, that it is a direct consequence of stigmatization or lack of support.",

      "title": "Parent-Child Speech and Child Custody Speech Restrictions",
      "abstract": "The best interests of the child standard -- the standard rule applied in custody disputes between two parents -- leaves family court judges ample room to consider a parent's ideology. Parents have had their rights limited or denied partly based on their advocacy of racism, homosexuality, adultery, nonmarital sex, Communism, Nazism, pacifism and disrespect for the flag, fundamentalism, polygamy, or religions that make it hard for children to fit in the western way of life in this society. Courts have also penalized or enjoined speech that expressly or implicitly criticizes the other parent, even when the speech has a broader ideological dimension. One parent, for instance, was ordered to make sure that there is nothing in the religious upbringing or teaching that the minor child is exposed to that can be considered homophobic, because the other parent was homosexual. Others have lost rights based partly on telling their children that the other parent was damned to Hell. One mother was stripped of custody partly because she accurately told her 12-year-old daughter that her ex-husband, who had raised the daughter from birth, wasn't in fact the girl's biological father. Courts have also restricted a parent's religious speech when such speech was seen as inconsistent with the religious education that the custodial parent was providing. The cases generally rest on the theory (sometimes pure speculation, sometimes based on some evidence in the record) that the children will become confused and unhappy by the contradictory teachings, and be less likely to take their parents' authority seriously. This article argues these restrictions are generally unconstitutional, except when they're narrowly focused on preventing one parent from undermining the child's relationship with the other. But the observations that lead to this rule are likely, I think, to prove more interesting to readers than the rule itself: (1) The best interests test lets courts engage in viewpoint-based speech restriction. (2) The First Amendment is implicated not only when courts issue orders restricting parents' speech, but also when courts make custody or visitation decisions based on such speech. (3) Even when the cases involve religious speech, the Free Speech Clause is probably more important than the Religion Clauses. (4) If parents in intact families have First Amendment rights to speak to their children, without the government restricting the speech under a best interests standard, then parents in broken families generally deserve the same rights. (5) Parents in intact families should indeed be free to speak to their children -- but not primarily because of their self-expression rights, or their children's interests in hearing the parents' views. Rather, the main reason to protect parental speech rights is that today's child listeners will grow up into the next generation's adult speakers. (6) Attempts to limit restrictions to speech that imminently threatens likely psychological harm (or even cause actual psychological harm) to children may seem appealing, but will likely prove unhelpful.",

This balance includes satisfying the needs of the individual, achieving the requirements of the environment, and biologists use the term adaptation to survive the organism, in contrast psychologists use the term for the survival of the individual in mental health, and refers to the concept of adaptation to psychological events that exclude cases To restore the individual to the appropriate level of his life in his environment.\r\nThe term of the other is broad, loose and indistinguishable. As a more comprehensive expression than being restricted in a certain way, it means any character other than the self, whether identical or opposite in form and content. It may mean the enemy, friend or neutral, whether in family, tribal, Sectarianism, although it’s most common meaning means another person or group of heterosexuals with a uniform identity.\r\nThe psychological variables represent a group of factors affecting human behavior and behavior. If the person is tense and unstable, his actions and reactions are illogical and irregular. If the person is calm and balanced, his actions are studied, organized and more rational. The psychological characteristics of the groups and the patterns of social interaction and the reciprocal influences among the individuals are reflected in the actions and behavior of the individual, social factors are the sum of the surrounding of the individual circumstances and factors and the social environment in which he lives.\r\nThe slums are areas deprived of basic facilities and services and therefore they produce many problems that disturb society and negatively affect its security and safety, and spread among its population poverty, unemployment, delinquency, crime, addiction and other problems, which are the general characteristics of these areas.\r\nThe objective of the research is to study the psychological and social variables related to adaptation and acceptance of the other in the Egyptian society.\r\nThe research has reached to some recommendations, which are:\r\n1 - The need to pay attention to human relations, starting from the family, school, and institutions of work in planting the foundations of the desire to the other.\r\n2 - The need to emphasize the role of the educational system in giving young people the skills of understanding and dialogue and acceptance of the other.\r\n3 - The need to adjust the negative trends in the population of slums and popular to positive trends towards acceptance of the other.",

      "abstract": "Definitions of domestic violence vary according to the frequency, severity and nature of the violence as well as the context in which it occurred and the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator. Though there is a lack of uniformity, a generally accepted definition of domestic violence is the physical, sexual or emotional abuse of an adult woman by a man with whom she has or has had an intimate relationship, regardless of whether the couple are living together. Although violence can be carried out by other family members or occur in same-sex relationships, it is argued that men use violence in order to maintain dominance and control over their female partners. Physical violence is just one of the many tactics that an abuser may use to exert control over his partner. Other behaviours include isolation, intimidation, threats of violence, threats to take the children away or hurt them and emotional or economic abuse. Whilst some studies have identified demographic patterns associated with domestic violence, it can affect any woman regardless of age, race, ethnicity, social class, employment status, religion, marital status or disability.",

When partners' goals correspond and their preferences are compatible, partners can readily achieve desirable outcomes such as security, companionship, and sexual fulfillment. When circumstances of interdependence are congenial, it is relatively easy for partners to gratify one another's most important needs. The real test of a relationship arises when circumstances are not so congenial-when partners encounter dilemmas involving conflicted interaction, incompatible preferences, extrarelationship temptation, or experience of betrayal. In dilemmas of this sort, the well-being of each person is incompatible with the well-being of the relationship and something must give. Thus, sometimes it is not so easy to maintain a healthy and vital ongoing relationship.",

Cases should be addressed in terms of their particular characteristics, of course, but a broader approach to the ethical issues inherent in the representation of those with disabilities is to consider the benefits and risks of the three major paradigms of disability available today: the symbolic (or metaphorical), the individual (or medical), and the social (or cultural). The last of these paradigms is best suited to honor both the rights and the interests of vulnerable subjects because it alone acknowledges that disability is not solely an individual concern.",

      "abstract": "Gender-based victimisation (GBV) is commonly experienced by transgender individuals, and can include physical or sexual violence; social, workplace, or housing discrimination; or family or social rejection. In addition to overt forms of GBV, transgender individuals experience gender identity-related microaggressions: subtle, frequently-occurring aversive events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection of an individual's gender identity. The degree to which a transgender individual is socially perceived as the gender with which they identify, sometimes referred to as passing, as well as sociodemographic factors such as annual income and race/ethnicity, have been previously linked with experiencing overt GBV. This study aimed to quantitatively assess whether self-rated degree of passing, age, annual income and being a person of colour were associated with the frequency with which transgender individuals experience less overt identity-related victimisation in the form of gender nonaffirmation microaggressions. Among an age-diverse sample of US adolescent and adult transgender persons (n = 224) who responded to 14 situational prompts of nonaffirmation microaggressions, adolescents experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions (M = 2.16, SD = 1.48). Factors significantly associated with increased average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions included lower degree of passing and lower income, while older age was associated with lower frequency of microaggressions.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is a public health problem that affects children worldwide in all ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic groups. These assaults are extremely dangerous not only due to their direct physical traumas received at the time of the abuse, but they also have long-term consequences that can worsen the future quality of the victim’s life. A retrospective study of all cases related to child sexual abuse for five years was performed by materials of the Clinic of Forensic Medicine and Deontology, Sofia, Bulgaria. Ninety-five cases involve children from both genders. The traumatic injuries were carefully examined and classified according to their localization over the victim’s bodies and based on the time that had passed after the reported assaults. In cases of sexual violence, the most informative and pointing at the exact type of violence are the injuries situated in the anogenital area. Too often, there is a lack of physical findings, depending on the type of sexual violence or associated with the prolonged time that passes after the crime. Children are unaware of what they have to do after suffering such traumas, or they are scared to share their experience with different family members, which can lead to late forensic examination and lack of physical and biological findings, which are the most critical traces in the criminal prosecution of the crimes and this can be a possibility for the perpetrator not to be charged for his unlawful actions.",

La violacion, la conducta respecto del embarazo resultante, el trato otorgado a quienes proponen y a quienes niegan el aborto por esta causa y la autocensura sobre el tema comparten el denominador comun de la violencia. Es violento todo comportamiento voluntario que quebranta lo razonable, se impone mediante maltratos, presion fisica, psicologica o moral y ofende, amenaza o dana la integridad de individuos, seres o personas. Asume variedades que se vinculan y potencian. Se ejerce violencia directa fisica y/o verbal cuando un emisor agrede fisica o mentalmente a alguien o a algo. Tal el caso del abuso de autoridad. Se acepta que existe una violencia indirecta, de contenido simbolico, que admite representaciones culturales y estructurales. Las comunidades comparten argumentos compuestos por mandatos emocionales que se sintetizan en “manifiestos“ culturales. Los elementos violentos que pudieran contener originan la violencia cultural, que ofrecen premisas para justificar presiones, criticas o aun amenazas que los “guardianes o custodios del ideario grupal” aplican a quienes desacuerdan con los preceptos. Las imposiciones son capaces de silenciar opiniones de quienes temen ser sancionados y asi, se autocensuran. El establecimiento de normas basadas en los conceptos antecitados genera la violencia estructural. Esta legitima agresiones de todo tenor como actos de “justicia”. Las posturas extremas en pos de “intereses superiores” (alguna fe religiosa o creencia politica) que no admiten disenso ni desacuerdo aceptan como “excusa” de la violencia la existencia de “pasiones desbordadas”. Estos paradigmas de violencia son capaces de impulsar guerras santas o atentados terroristas y provocar hambre, miseria, enfermedad o incluso la muerte de semejantes. La violencia directa no es innata. Emerge en un pot pourri socio-cultural como producto personalizado, aprendido y aplicado en escenarios donde el hecho se defiende y justifica, contenido en circulos viciosos de dificil solucion1 . “El hombre...es lo que la educacion le hace ser”, aseguro Kant. Carente de sostenes cultural y estructural solo cabe a la violencia rechazo y condena. Hoy, la condicion esencial del ser es la autonomia, la individualidad del sujeto se considera sustantiva y se insiste en fundar la responsabilidad personal en la pretendida, meneada, exigida y manoseada libertad. Los argumentos racionales para la toma de decisiones, son necesarios en este contexto. Aunque sobran disensos, cabe preguntarse si alguna violencia responde a deseos “secretos” de alguna comunidad2.

      "title": "On the psychological attachment of infants to their mothers",
      "abstract": "The attachment of the infant to the mother can be seen in open parkland when an infant is set free for exercise and play. In an area of safe space, a mother has little cause to restrain her child, nor, owing to other attractions around, to entertain or otherwise divert him. In order to deduce which of the women and infants make up kinship pairs, the observer postulates criteria for recognizing a pair; attachment is then conceived of as factors which identify a mother and her infant in field conditions. The infant detaches himself from his mother but he maintains proximity to her, particularly around the age of 2 years, when his proximity- and contact-seeking are at their height. Yet, at this age, the infant shows most alertness to remote events. From 2 years old onwards, the presence of age-mates competes for the infant's proximity. Hence, the statistical data presented below is from observations which were made when the likelihood of interruption by neighbouring people was minimal. Proximity to the mother can be defined as the child's being at rest beside her, or as his playing in her vicinity, or as a pattern of exploratory locomotion with the mother the centre of the territory he covers. In each of these aspects, the behaviour of 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds is distinguished by typical distances from the mother. The infant's responsiveness to unexpected sights or sounds is inferred from the orientation responses he makes to them. In his postures and the distances he takes up from the mother, his feeling-states of alertness, fear, anger, uncertainty, fatigue and conflict are expressed; when thus activated, he tends to relate himself to his mother.",

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for child sexual abuse",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Child sexual abuse (CSA) is the involvement of children and adolescents in sexual activities (usually for adult sexual stimulation or gratification) that they cannot fully comprehend and to which they cannot consent as a fully equal, self-determining participant, because of their early stage of development [Box 1].Box 1: Defining child sexual abuseIt is important to understand the nature and type of CSA as the severity of the impact of the abuse depends on not only on the type of abuse but also on the duration of the abuse and very importantly, whether the abuser is a known/trusted person or a stranger [Table 1].Table 1: Nature or type of child sexual abuseThus, CSA is a complex issue, wherein impact and recovery depend on all of the above variables and how they combine to influence the child's experience of abuse. Even where there are two children, who have been impacted by identical forms and processes of abuse (similar variables), they may still be different in terms of their responses. This difference is accounted for personality and temperament of each child, and social context and circumstances of each child, due to which each child perceives and internalizes the abuse differently, thus resulting in different emotional and behavioral states to the abuse, and necessitating different psychosocial and mental health responses. CSA is not a clinical condition or diagnosis. Clinical practice guidelines for standard child psychiatric conditions can be developed based on existing knowledge and practices. However, to develop clinical practice guidelines for an experience that is both nuanced and complicated by psychological and social processes is a particular challenge. Clinical practice guidelines for CSA, therefore, necessitate mental health professionals to work with many processes and systems to effectively assist the child. CONTEXT OF CONSULTATION There are broadly three contexts in which children present for consultation on sexual abuse issues. The first is when CSA is already established by agencies and individuals, and they refer the child to the mental health system. Such referrals may be received from: (i) District Child Protection Units; (ii) Childline and child care agencies/service providers; (ii) Police; and (iii) Courts and judicial personnel. Children are brought by such agencies and bodies either for interventions in the wake of trauma and emotional problems and/or for inquiry and evidence gathering for use in court cases. Thus, in this context, the mental health system is not required to establish whether or not CSA has occurred, as it is already known – usually, children would have reported abuse or in case of children in sex trafficking, they have been rescued through a raid on sex work institutions, and so the abuse has come to light. The second context is one in which the child has reported to his/her parents but they, in turn, have not reported the abuse to police or legal systems. However, they seek consultation to provide the child with mental health interventions. The third context is when it is not (yet) known that he/she has been sexually abused; the child comes to the mental health system for some psychological or psychiatric manifestation, but on enquiry and examination, CSA issues emerge in one of the following ways: The child discloses or reports abuse An adolescent girl is found to be pregnant (Frequent) urinary tract infections in the child are reported by the child/caregivers and/or genital injuries in the child are reported/observed Emotional and behavioral issues that are associated with anxiety, anger, and depression. There is what is called an index of suspicion in CSA, i.e., when to suspect CSA and how true one's suspicions likely to be. Figure 1 represents the index of suspicion in CSA. At the peak of the triangle, the index of suspicion is the highest, i.e., there is no doubt when a child reports or discloses that abuse has taken place, especially when a child spontaneously reports without particular inquiry by an adult.Figure 1: Index of suspicion in child sexualEqually high on the index is pregnancy (in adolescent girls) – a sure sign that sexual abuse has occurred. Genital injuries and frequent urinary tract infections must lead to suspicion that there is digital handling and sexual abuse is very likely to have taken place. Emotional and behavioral changes observed in the child are important indicators of CSA; however, they come lower on the index of suspicion because these psychological changes may occur due to some reasons (unlike pregnancy or genital injuries which do not have a range of reasons for their occurrence!). Emotional and behavioral issues relating to anxiety and depression may occur due to sexual abuse but may also be due to other difficult and traumatic experiences such as parental marital conflict, bullying, learning difficulties and academic pressures, loss, and grief (death-related) experiences… so, while emotional and behavioral changes may lead to CSA suspicion, further examination and inquiry needs to be made (by a psychosocial or mental health professional) to understand exactly what difficult event(s) or experiences they are attributable to in a given child. During the inquiry, if sexual abuse is ruled out, then the signs and symptoms may be attributable to other difficult experiences. Below are indices of CSA [Table 2].Table 2: Emotional and behavioral indices of child sexual abusePROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING AND CONFIRMING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE The procedure for establishing and/or confirming CSA has three components, namely, (i) Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment; (ii) Developmental Assessment; (iii) Abuse Inquiry or Forensic Interviewing for CSA. The third component particularly, is predicated on the first two components, which makes it necessary for the three assessments to be done in the order in which they are listed and described. Psychosocial and mental health assessment It is important to obtain a detailed history and assessment of the child, including information on family and school context, developmental level and functionality, emotional and behavioral issues (pre- and post-sexual abuse), circumstances of the alleged abuse, the child's experience and understanding of the abuse and other related problems. Treatment and interventions for abuse must be developed based on the complete assessment of the child's context and issues; this is because every child is unique and has his/her own unique ways, based on age, developmental stage, personality and temperament, family and social circumstances, and the nature of abuse, of processing the abuse experience. Information requires to be obtained through the assessment of the child and family/caregivers. The immediate aftermath of the abuse, i.e., within the first few days is not the time for asking the child to provide the abuse narrative in great detail as this is likely to distress and traumatize the child further. The objective of the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment [Box 2] is to establish that abuse has occurred and to know the nature of abuse, i.e., contact versus non-contact, penetrative versus nonpenetrative abuse with a view to making decisions regarding medical interventions, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) interventions, as necessary.Box 2: Psychosocial and mental health assessmentIt is important to understand any emotional and behavioral issues the child had before the abuse and compare these to those that may have occurred post-abuse. This is because (i) we need to understand exactly which emotional and behavioral problems that are attributable to abuse; (ii) we need to understand how pre-abuse emotional and behavioral issues may have determined the ways in which the child has processed the abuse experience and been impacted by it. In either case, the child would need to receive treatment and assistance for all emotional and behavioral issues, both pre-existing ones as well as those that developed as a result of the abuse. Developmental assessment The developmental assessment requires to be completed before any forensic interviewing processes and/or interventions are entered into with children for eliciting abuse narratives. The purposes of conducting a developmental assessment in the context of CSA are two-fold: To make decisions about the feasibility and use of methods to elicit the abusive narrative in accordance with the developmental abilities of the child, for treatment and intervention purposes and/or as part of evidence gathering for court cases/legal processes To be able to design and/or deliver age-appropriate interventions; this includes the use of communication and methodologies that are comprehensible to a child in the course of treatment, including to provide personal safety education and awareness (which forms a part of the treatment interventions). There are five specific domains of development that children require to be assessed in: physical or locomotor, speech and language, cognitive, social and emotional development. If the abilities and skills in these domains are not age-appropriate, then there are implications for forensic interviewing and evidence gathering for court cases and legal processes [Box 3].Box 3: Applying child development assessment to CSA inquiry and interventionInquiry with the child: Forensic interviewing for child sexual abuse This includes interviewing the child to obtain information on the sequence of abuse events and how they occurred according to the child, and how the child perceived and understood the abuse. The interview may have to be carried out in well-planned sessions, over a period of time, especially in the case of younger children or children with posttraumatic disorder. Creative play methods, such as stories, art and toys/dolls may have to be used to elicit children's narratives. Such indirect methods are gentle and nonthreatening and also allow younger children with less developed verbal abilities to communicate their experiences of abuse. During these sessions, while eliciting children's abuse narratives, open-ended questions that encourage children to express themselves freely should be used. A detailed verbatim recording of the interview should be done through written documentation as well as video recordings in case of play sessions with young children so that these can also be used for legal proceedings. Introduction and rapport building Greet the child and tell him/her your name and then, ask the child his/her name Sit at the same physical level as child (if the child is on the floor, sit on the floor… if the child is sitting on a chair, sit on the chair next to her) Use toys and play activities (dolls, puzzles, picture books, and coloring books…) to engage young children and give it to the child as soon as (s)he comes to the court (while waiting for you) Enter into play with the child and spend 5–10 min engaging child in play activity… \"what are you doing? What is the doll doing? May I see what you are coloring?\" Engage in neutral conversation with the child for a few minutes (this also helps to assess the child's developmental abilities and skills as well as mental state)--What did you eat for breakfast today? How did you come here today? Who are these people who have come with you?.... \" For older children and adolescents, you may say \"I really want to know you better. Tell me about the things you like to do\" Introduce the space and the purpose of the child being there, including your role: \"My name is… my job here is to make sure that children are safe and no one hurts them. If we hear that someone is hurting or troubling children, then we do things to stop that from happening\" \"You may be wondering about this busy place and many rooms…many people come here, just like you to talk about people who have hurt or troubled them…that's why we need a big space like this and many people to help\" \"Although this place may seem a little scary and confusing, you are safe here…and after we have spent a little time talking, you can go back home with your parents or caregiver.\" Explain the need for video camera/microphone (in case you are using such equipment) – \"As you can see, we have a video-camera and microphones here. They will record our conversation so I can remember everything you tell me. Sometimes, I forget things and the recorder allows me to listen to you without having to write everything down.\" (In case you are taking notes, you may provide a similar explanation to the child). Ensuring accurate reporting This is to ensure that the child has the competency to differentiate between truth and lies and to ensure that children tell the truth. Establish the need for telling the truth, and child's capacity to differentiate between what's true or not and to say \"I don't understand\" or to tell examiner when he makes a wrong statement: Part of my job is to talk to children (teenagers) about things that have happened to them. I meet with lots of children (teenagers) so that they can tell me the truth about things that have happened to them. Hence, before we begin, I want to make sure that you understand how important it is to tell the truth For younger children, explain: (\"What is true and what is not true\"). \"If I say that my shoes are red (or green) is that true or not true?\" (Wait for an answer, then say:) \"That would not be true, because my shoes are really (black/blue/etc.). And if I say that I am sitting down now, would that be true or not true (right or not right)?\" (Wait for an answer.) It would be (true/right) because you can see I am really sitting down.' \"I see that you understand what telling the truth means. It is very important that you only tell me the truth today.

Now you know you should tell me if I make a mistake or say something that is not right. You may record your observations as follows: Capacity to differentiated \"truth\" established Yes No Capacity to say \"I don't understand\" established Yes No Capacity to tell interviewer that she/he \"is not right\" established Yes No. Training in episodic memory Episodic memory represents our memory of experiences and specific events in time in a serial form, from which we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at any given point in our lives. It is the memory of autobiographical events (times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual knowledge) that can be explicitly stated. Individuals tend to see themselves as actors in these events, and the emotional charge and the entire context surrounding an event is usually part of the memory, not just the bare facts of the event itself (http://www.human-memory.net/types_episodic.html). It is essential to encourage children to provide detailed responses early in the interview as this enhances their descriptive responses to open-ended prompts in other parts of the interview, particularly those related to the abuse incident. Hence, at this stage of the interview, training in episodic memory or narrative practice should be done as follows: \" It is very important that you tell me everything you remember about things that have happened to you. You can tell me both good things and bad things\" Identify a recent event the child experienced- the first day of school, birthday party, holiday) and build up on that using qualifiers like tell me, what happened next, \"Think hard about (activity or event) and tell me what happened on that day from the time you got up that morning until (some portion of the event mentioned by the child in response to the previous question). \"Tell me more about (activity mentioned by the child).\" (Wait for an answer.) Use this prompt as often as needed throughout this section] \"Earlier you mentioned [activity mentioned by the child]. Tell me everything about that.\" Note: Focus on real-life events; avoid focusing on accounts relating to television, videos, and fantasy. Abuse enquiry Now transition to substantive issues to enable the child to provide you with the narrative by using open questions such as: \"Now that I know a little about you, I want to talk about why (you are here) today\" \"I heard you talked to \"X\" about something that happened – tell me what happened\" \"I see you have (a bruise, a broken arm, etc.,) – tell me what happened\" \"I heard you saw (the doctor, a policeman, etc.) last week – tell me how come/what you talked about\" \"Is (your mom, another person) worried about something that happened to you? Tell me what she is worried about\" \"I understand someone might have troubled you – tell me what happened\" \"I understand someone may have done something that wasn't right – tell me what happened\" \"I understand something may have happened at (location) – tell me what happened\" Young children, who either do not have the language to name private parts and genitals or are unwilling to name these parts due to fear and embarrassment, use pictures or dolls to assist the child--\"I will show you a picture (here is a doll)… can you show me/point to where this person touched or hurt you…\" Probe for disclosure Use gentle probes, including some close-ended questions to confirm some details. If child has mentioned telling someone about the incident(s), ask details, if not then probe about possible immediate disclosure by saying: \"Does anybody else know what happened?\" How did they come to know? [Box 4]Box 4: Techniques of Inquiry: Leading questionsClosing the interview The closure phase helps to provide an end to a conversation that may have been emotionally difficult for the child. \"You have told me lots of things today, and I want to thank you for helping me.\" \"I want to especially tell you how brave you are for telling me all that happened… things like this happen to many children, but they don't always want to tell others about it… because they are afraid. You may also have been scared, but you were brave to tell people about it – I am sure your parents are proud of you… I am too\" \"Is there anything else you think I should know?\" \"Is there anything you want to tell me?\" \"Are there any questions you want to ask me?\" \"If you want to talk to me again, you can call me at this phone number and come and see me again.\" (Give the child or caregiver your name and phone number). IMPACT OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION After eliciting the abuse narrative, it is critical to understand the methods and processes used by the perpetrator to sexually abuse the child. CSA is a process that consists of a series of actions entailing lure, seduction, manipulation and/or coercion and threat. Different methods and processes of abuse have different psychological impacts on children and adolescents. Not all CSA results in trauma; in fact, where CSA methods use lure, seduction, and manipulation to \"manufacture\" the consent of the child (versus methods of threat, violent coercion, and aggression), there may be the less overt or visible traumatic reaction in the child [Table 3].Table 3: Understanding trauma dynamics: The impact of child sexual abuseAbuse in the context of \"manufactured consent\" When abuse has taken place through grooming processes (i.e., lure, inducement, and manipulation) and violence, threat and coercion methods have played little or no role in the abuse process, children/adolescents are less likely to be aware of and acknowledge the abuse [Box 5].Box 5: When and why children do not acknowledge abuse experiencesImplications for intervention Focus on helping children recognize various types of child (sexual) abuse, including understanding why and how certain actions constitute abuse Reassurances to child on safety and protection (from the perpetrator) Arrangements with parents/caregiver to ensure the child's safety and protection. Abuse of young children In younger children, the methods of abuse entail (i) inducement and lure and/or (ii) coercion and threat. Inducement and lure entail the use of sweets and toys to get children to perform or cooperate in sexual acts for adult stimulation. Perpetrators also use attention and affection in exchange for sexual favors, i.e., provision of attention and affection when the child complies with the adult on sexual acts and withdrawal of attention and affection when the child does not. These methods are followed by the perpetrator creating excitement and secrecy around the sexual act, often presenting it to the child as a \"special new game,\" a \"secret game\" that no one else plays and no one else knows about; and young children, who have no understanding of sexuality are vulnerable to such ruses. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury Teaching children about safety issues related to strangers as well as known persons Enabling children to learn how to protect their bodies, i.e., which body parts should not be touched by anyone except for select family members such as mothers/caregivers during personal hygiene activities Helping children discern between \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" secrets Validation of emotions and provision of reassurance for children who may be traumatized by the CSA. Abuse of adolescents In older children and adolescents, the processes of abuse are similar, but the use of lure and inducement are slightly different and these processes are also known as 'grooming' [Box 6]. Given that adolescents are at a life stage wherein they are interested in issues of love, attraction and sexuality and are also keen to experiment with these experiences, perpetrators tend to use lure and inducements that are more emotional in nature (rather than the more material ones used with younger children). This means that they smooth talk adolescents about their physical appeal and qualities, making promises of long-term emotional, and romantic relationships with them—and adolescents interpret these actions as being loving and romantic.Box 6: The grooming processAgain, given the life stage adolescents are at, often also under peer pressure to experiment with sexuality, offenders have the perfect opportunity to manipulate them into sexual engagement by transmitting all sorts of misconceptions about sexual behaviors and norms. For instance, appealing to adolescents' need to \"fit in\" with their peers, perpetrators tell adolescents that it is necessary to gain sexual experience, that it would be \"uncool\" if they are ignorant about sexual acts. As a result, adolescents, who are still acquiring life skills such as (sexual) decision-making, are negatively influenced, believing in the misconceptions transmitted to them, confused by how they should respond. Following such manipulation and abuse, adolescents experience feelings of tremendous confusion, especially as they have shared \"deep\" sexual and romantic relationships with the offender. They find it exceedingly difficult to discern this as an abused process and defend the offender, often refusing to accept that this is abuse. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury In case of pregnancy, decisions around medical termination of pregnancy, depending on the medical issues as well as the adolescent's desire to have/keep the child, i.e., from a child rights' perspective, facilitating discussions with the adolescent to help her make decisions about her pregnancy Helping adolescents explore notions of love, romance, and relationships Enabling adolescents to understand various forms of coercion, ranging from material lure to persuasion and threat; focussing on an understanding of consent in sexual relationships [Box 7] Personal safety awareness and education focussing on equipping adolescents with sexual decision-making skills (a life skills approach) Validation of emotions and working with notions of self-identity, including feelings of guilt and shame, in children and adolescents who may be traumatized by the CSA. Box 7: The issue of consentINTERVENTIONS As also shown in Figure 2, CSA interventions can be broadly categorized into three types of responses:Figure 2: Child sexual abuse interventions Medical assistance Psychosocial interventions First level responses for children Depth therapeutic interventions for children Interventions for parents and caregivers. Legal assistance. Medical assistance In case a child is referred immediately after abuse, i.e., within a few hours or days), it is necessary to first proceed with a medical evaluation and requisite medical interventions as a priority. Treatment history and response to treatment (in case the child has already undergone or is undergoing treatment) should be recorded. Ideally, it must be ensured that the child is provided with emergency medical services within 24 h of filing the first information report (FIR) in case a police report has been filed or even otherwise. Physical examination Physical examination of the child to be conducted including 2 ID marks The child's family or caregiver should be present in the room during the examination Permission of the child and consent of the parent to be taken before the examination What physical symptoms does the child have at present/(e.g., burning sensation during micturition, White Discharge per Vagina, itching in the perineal area, bleeding, any injury, pain in any area, etc.) Post-exposure prophylaxis If a child is within the 36 h window period (especially in case of penetrative abuse): Has the child received Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) (within 36 h) in case of penetrative abuse? If not, refer to Paediatric ART Centre for PEP Even if the child is not in the window period and the penetrative abuse has occurred within a month, refer to the Paediatric ART Centre so that a decision can be taken regarding initiation of PEP Ensure that the child/adolescent has received oral contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy Ensure that the child has been medically evaluated by a Registered Medical Practitioner, namely a pediatrician or gynecologist from a government hospital, for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), urinary tract infection and/or injuries. The STD investigation must be repeated at the end of 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Forensic examination Check whether an additional specific forensic evaluation has been done (examination requested by police documenting abuse, if swabs have been taken in case of penetrative abuse), and if so, whether the report is available. Obtain the report from the relevant source. Pregnancy tests Ensure that a urine pregnancy test has been done In case the results are a false negative, it would be best to obtain an additional gynecological opinion In case the child/adolescent is under 20 weeks pregnant, discussions about abortion may need to be done with the child/adolescent and her caregivers. It is also advisable to liaise with an obstetrician at this time. Psychosocial and mental health interventions for children and families Following medical assistance, or simultaneously, psychosocial and mental health interventions should be initiated for the child and family, based on the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment completed. Developmental assessments and forensic interviewing may follow subsequently, and be embedded in the counseling and therapy processes. Pharmacotherapy Pharmacotherapy is not specifically indicated for CSA unless it results in severe anxiety and depressive states. Children who have undergone CSA and present with severe PTSD will require medication in addition to other psychosocial interventions: These medications include specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or benzodiazepines, in dosages recommended as per body weight. SSRIs are also indicated in situations where CSA results in severe depression associated with self-harm behaviors, dissociation, and agitation. States of agitation may call for SOS medication with low dosage benzodiazepines There are a group of children with pre-existing vulnerabilities or those in whom the trauma is so destabilizing that it results in mood dysregulation. This group of children may require mood stabilizers. Older children and adolescents, particularly, must not be coerced to take medication in case they are unwilling i.e. they require to be counselled, including on issues of need and adherence [Box 8].Box 8: Preparing the children and adolescents for medical tests and treatmentFirst level psychosocial responses for children Asking questions, and attempting to establish depth interventions when the child is facing a crisis, i.e., in the immediate aftermath of abuse, is not a useful beginning. This is not the time to for detailed enquiry. If there are serious and disruptive manifestations such as self-harm behaviors, incapacitating anxiety, PTSD symptoms with severe panic, appropriate psychiatric referral at this stage is important (as psychiatric medication may be required for anxiety symptoms to reduce before any counseling work is initiated). However, certain initial responses or what are know as first level responses [Box 9] of a supportive nature require to be provided to the child.Box 9: Objectives of first level responses to child sexual abuseEnsuring child's safety Depending on where the abuse occurred and who the perpetrator is, it is essential to immediately take measures to protect the child from further abuse. This is especially applicable when the perpetrator is a family member or a person known to the child, and where the abuse has occurred at home or in places the child frequents on a daily or regular basis (such as school/tutorials, etc).

      "title": "Behavioral Inhibition as a Temperamental Category",
      "abstract": "Abstract Historical changes in the sense meaning of the term temperament have been less dramatic than alterations in other important psychological concepts, such as emotion, memory, symptom, or perception. Most ancient and modern writers agreed that the human temperaments were combinations of psychological profiles (behaviors, thoughts, and emotions) and their presumed biological foundations, which, during this century, were assumed to be genetically mediated. A set of psychological features was not sufficient evidence to posit a temperamental disposition. Chronic shyness with strangers, for example, need not be due to a temperamental bias, because some shy adults could have acquired that trait during adolescence. A combination of a psychological profile and its presumed biological foundation represents the ideal definition of a temperament. Combining behavior with biological measures is common in other domains. An individual born with the genes for compromised pancreatic function who has normal blood sugar levels is not diabetic. An adolescent born to two schizophrenic parents who displays one non debilitating marker of this illness is not regarded as schizophrenic as long as he or she does not display any of the primary symptoms that define the category. However, the lack of insight into the biological contribution to temperament has meant that, at present, the psychological features compose the primary definition of temperament. The definition of temperament offered here suggests the potential error in classifying a trait as temperamental simply because it is stable over long periods of time. Future research on the temperaments will gather biological data and, if possible, begin with observations of young children. As investigators discover sensitive biological markers for each of the temperamental types, they will be able to separate groups of children or adults who display similar behavioral phenotypes into those who probably do and probably do not possess the relevant temperaments. The research of Davidson (1994, 1995) and Fox, Schmidt, Calkins, Rubin, &amp; Coplan (1996) on asymmetry of alpha power in frontal areas illustrates this point. These investigators suggest that greater activation in the right frontal area than in the left (that is, greater desynchronization of alpha frequencies on the right side) is a sensitive sign of a temperamental vulnerability to uncertainty and/or anxiety. As a result, scientists can gather the electroencephalograph (EEG) data on groups of anxious adults and parse these samples into distinct groups based on the presence or absence of right-hemisphere activation. This suggestion is not fanciful. My laboratory has been following a large group of middleclass, Caucasian children who were evaluated initially at 4 months of age (see Kagan, 1994). Twenty percent of the infants, called high reactive, displayed high levels of motor activity and distress to a variety of unfamiliar stimuli; 40% of the sample, classified as low reactive, showed the complementary profile of minimal motor activity and distress. More children from the high-reactive group became shy and fearful in the second year, whereas most low reactives became relatively sociable and fearless.",

      "title": "G114(P) Children with Exceptional Healthcare Needs: \"Personhood\" and Moral Standing in Community",
      "abstract": "For almost 400 years philosophers have debated the attributes necessary for “personhood” or full moral status. While some argue that defining the moral status of children with profound intellectual disability and exceptional healthcare needs is an academic pursuit which fails to ensure that their best interests are met, I believe that the issue warrants careful consideration. Personhood confers moral status and protection by moral norms, if children with exceptional healthcare needs do not have full moral status, it could be argued that they are not holders of human rights. A number of criteria necessary for “Personhood” have been proposed including attributes of the individual, either biological or psychological, or factors regarding an individual’s membership of a species or community and their potential to develop relationships within that group. Although children with profound intellectual disability do not have the necessary cognitive ability to meet the psychological criteria for personhood, I argue that as members of the same species all human have moral status and deserve protection. By considering children and adults with profound intellectual disability as holders of full moral status, an obligation to protect their rights is conferred. Society has an obligation to ensure that their best interests are met. The law has repeatedly stated that competent adults have a right to refuse treatment; the right to die is inherent in law. In this respect if children with exceptional health care needs have full moral status they do not only have the right to medical treatment but also the right to be protected from unnecessary, futile and potentially painful procedures in the absence of any hope of cure. Thus when considering the best interests of children with exceptional healthcare needs, attempts must be made to ensure that their rights as persons are respected.",

Many adolescent girls are insufficiently informed about the mechanisms of reproduction or the techniques of birth control and first come to medical attention or consult a family planning center when already pregnant. However, among those teenagers who do become pregnant or even experience motherhood at an age when society would rather see them on school benches, some are neither ignorant about sexuality nor the victims of an unpredictable failure. For those, contraception and the desire for pregnancy or motherhood are in conflict with one another and is only further aggravated by various sociocultural and psychosocial factors. All too often, such a conflict results in a voluntarily ignored or unconsciously rejected contraception option, with an unplanned pregnancy as the outcome.",

In industrial and postindustrial societies this passage depends less and less on the onset of old age and all that this entails-less physically able, a reduced intellectual capacity, and is increasingly linked to an economic and social value attributed to the individual on the basis of a change in occupational status following retirement. This change is usually classified according to outdated rules, which are no longer acceptable, so that the age at which one ‘s working life ends can often coincide with a stage when the individual concerned is by no means old (Livi Bacci, 1987; Egidi, 1990).",

We will expand: it refers not only to politics but to the way of achieving political goals. The sources of violence are seen in the biosocial human nature. Aggression since the early history of mankind as well as its sociality has been the main means to survive. In the course of evolution it does not fade but gets the nature of violence to satisfy, first of all, biological and social requirements in the status of self-affirmation and prestige. So, terrorism is an intelligent phenomenon. Violence as a way of compulsion is to this or that extent inherent in any society. So the violence of the state over its citizens is approved of. On the other hand, however violence carried out against the state by a single person or a group of terrorists is also the way of compulsion to execute some regulations which are now necessary to terrorists. Senseless violence, violence for the sake of violence is a pathological symptom, the psychiatric diagnosis which can’t be logical. It can’t even go under the logic of terror.",

      "title": "Arguing against inhumane and degrading punishment",
      "abstract": "Increasingly, it seems, there are crimes so appalling that they challenge our resolve not to sink to the level of their perpetrators as we punish them. In cases where several victims have not only been murdered, but also raped, tortured, mutilated, dismembered, or eaten, it is understandable why some members of the public are prepared to have the state inflict a little of the same treatment on the perpetrators. This is especially true when the victims are children. Like most others who ponder the limits to legal punishment, I think that we should resist the impulse to inflict inhumane or degrading punishments on the worst offenders. Unlike many of them, however, I am not always persuaded by claims to the effect that the inherent dignity of offenders is the ground of an absolute moral prohibition on such forms of treatment.(1) At times I am attracted to such a firm prohibition. But at other times I understand the impulse to question it, to ask whether some crimes are so despicable that their perpetrators forfeit or otherwise lose any claim they have to minimally decent treatment by their fellow human beings. Alternatively, and I suspect more interestingly, I wonder whether the claim to be treated in minimally decent fashion, though very stringent, can be outweighed by more stringent moral claims. If we could gain something very important by brutal treatment of the worst criminal offenders, should we not at least consider seriously the arguments for doing so? We should see what follows if we are prepared to relax the rigid prohibition on inhumane or degrading punishments just a bit. If, as I shall attempt to show, doing so would gain us very little of moral significance, then it would be useful to be able to explain to ourselves and others how and why this is so. The suggestion that we should weigh a prohibition on inhumane and degrading punishment against the attainment of other moral goods or the avoidance of other moral evils will immediately raise the hackles of some moral theorists. Such theorists believe that any defensible theory of punishment must include certain inflexible moral constraints. If we are willing to weigh such constraints--in this case, one that strictly limits the kinds of legal sanctions we impose on offenders--against the achievement of other aims, then perhaps the best we will be able to do is make a contingent case for them. For many theorists this will be an unsatisfactory outcome, especially when it comes to prohibitions on punishment of the innocent or on disproportional punishment.(2) Lurking in the background, here, is a formidable and long-standing dispute in moral theory, one that I do not pretend to address adequately in the discussion that follows. Brief consideration is given to the question of whether the approach I develop can account for the prohibition on punishment of the innocent. Also, the question is raised whether the proportionality requirement, by itself, rules out inhumane and degrading punishments. I suggest that it does not and, thus, that other arguments must be employed against the use of inhumane and degrading punishments. Though these arguments have a contingent character, they are contingent in an unusual way. They treat some interests that individuals have as morally more important than others of their interests. Specifically, the interests individuals have in being treated neither inhumanely nor degradingly are taken to be crucial ones that cannot be outweighed by considerations of mere utility. Some of the arguments discussed will be familiar because, in slightly different forms, they are central to scholarly debate over the death penalty. But the moral prohibition on inhumane and degrading punishments is more general. Short of killing offenders, there is a range of deprivations or kinds of suffering that we might, and sometimes do, impose on those found guilty of serious crimes. These include denials of decent food and medical care, adequate space, sufficient heat, fresh air, exercise, religious or political expression, conjugal or parental visitations, and access to entertainment or culture. …",

      "abstract": "The expression \"wasting time\" is a colloquial label for periods of time spent waiting to receive services in various social situations in which people find themselves in state or private institutions, such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs or health institutions, banks and technical inspections of vehicles, etc. In this way, the superiority of social or cultural time over individual time is manifested. Cultural use of time represents the tendency to manage linear time by repeating events anchored in certain time segments, such as rituals, music festivals, sports events, or national holidays. Individuals perceive time based on cultural learning, understanding sociocultural time as a framework for organizing their personal time. This means that when they are not engaged in activities arising from collective time, individuals tend to organize their time according to their personal needs and intentions - as much as possible.Wasting time is therefore perceived as time not spent on activities related to work or free time that are the consequence of personal choice or existential necessity. The term most often refers to the waiting periods, which are apparently not regarded as integral to completing a task, such as a medical examination or obtaining personal documents. The concept of wasting time emerges as an uncreative, imposed, wasted time spent on completing tasks that could be organized differently. It is an empty time, devoid of important events and which is contrasted with periods of activity. The idea of ​​wasting time corresponds to the personal experience of time. The given expression is a consequence of evaluating whether or not a certain period of time was spent usefully, viewed from a personal perspective. Everyone's experience suggests that time seems to pass more slowly when we can do nothing but wait. The networking of such experiences, arising from a multitude of social situations that impose prolonged waiting as a procedural part to obtain what is considered useful or necessary for individuals, can be characterised as a cultural practice. The contributors to this practice include all social institutions that provide services to users through direct contact and hold a societal monopoly of performing their activities.",

      "abstract": "A verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's written on.* Whether one is a movie mogul or a practicing lawyer, the problem with oral contracts has long been recognized. Such problems have been prevalent in the estate and estate planning area. The best laid estate plans may come to naught when a despised relative shows up after death claiming to have had a contract with the deceased to receive all of the deceased's estate.' I. INTRODUCTION If a man can't forge his own will, whose will can heforge?** Contracts to make a will occur in a variety of factual situations. Very often they involve the elderly. As people grow older, their reliance on others normally increases because of their inability to care for themselves. This is especially true of those who have lost spouses and who, as a result, come to rely on relatives for normal needs such as housing and food. The furnishing of these services by a friend or relative may be motivated by a variety of reasons, including friendship, good samaritanism or, unfortunately, greed. In many instances, no mention is ever made of compensation to the providers. In such a situation, after the death of the one receiving the services, the providers may claim there was an oral contract to make a will, under the terms of which they were to be left certain property in exchange for their providing care for the deceased. 2",

      "abstract": "I conclude that Mary and Abe's decision to conceive a child to save a child does not impose harm on persons or on relationships in the family. Nor does it evince a lack of respect for the child they have conceived. The ethical guidelines that support this conclusion can now be summarized. First, actions should not depersonalize or otherwise endanger personal relationships. Second, although ideally personal relationships are initiated and continued for their own sake, after a personal relationship has been established and sustained the motives for establishing it recede in importance. Third, the requirement of honesty looms especially large in the context of personal relationships. Fourth, privacy protects personal relationships in the family from intrusion by the state. Fifth, even if those with whom we stand in personal relationships are not fully rational or self-conscious, we should treat them with respect. Finally, persons often are called upon to make greater sacrifices in personal relationships. These principles represent only the barest beginnings of an ethics for filial relationships. Nonetheless, they mark progress in the direction of developing a more complete account. We should not suppose that ethics in the family always will be spontaneous or \"natural\". Over a century ago, Mill warned that nature and natural are \"one of the most copious sources of false taste, false philosophy, false morality, and even bad law\". Especially in the wake of medical advances, such as recombinant DNA and new reproductive technologies, the complexity of filial ethics will only increase. The demographics of an aging society will add further complexity to filial contexts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Sexual orientation is a complex area. It is unclear to date how people precisely establish their preferred sexual objects. This paper presents two cases, whose heterosexual preference were changed in late adolescent age after a severe psychological event, to draw attention to the study of the possible underlying mechanism. Case 1, one identical male twin, was seriously punished at age 12 years, as he loved a girl in his classroom. Afterwards, he feared to contact with girls, and became attracted to young men at age 17 years, and kept same-sex sexual behaviors since then. However, his twin brother is always heterosexual. Case 2, a girl at age 16 years, was unexpectedly betrayed by her boyfriend, she bore great pain and distress in the beginning. Since then, she had a definite opinion that men were unbelievable, and gradually turned her heterosexual preference and had same-sex sexual behaviors with a girl classmate more than 3 years. Our case presentation indicates that severe frustration of primary heterosexual desires or behaviors and the successive cognitive regulation might lead susceptible adolescents into reorienting their sexual preference. The role of prefrontal cortex and related neuromodulatory pathways were discussed.",

Self-evident stands out in the obstacles and difficulties related to filing a complaint or news and obtaining evidence due to the specificity of this type of crime, as well as legal barriers related to testimony, as one of the spouses is not a witness to the other, and the origin is not a witness to his branch or the branch is a witness to his origin, Unless he was accused of a crime against them, and thus the subjectivity becomes clear in proving this type of crime.",

      "title": "Work disability and musculoskeletal disease",
      "abstract": "The value of good work for individuals and the community is clear. Work provides financial security for individuals and their families and gives people a sense of purpose and meaning. It is also clearly associated with significant health benefits. Productive work is also one of the pillars upon which the wealth of the community is built. Loss of work is a common consequence of ill health. Chronic illness has particularly significant effects on long-term work participation. Individuals with chronic health problems often require long-term social security support, particularly as the burden of disease accumulates with age. Among the most significant diseases contributing to this burden are the musculoskeletal diseases. The true burden of work impairment from musculoskeletal disease is uncertain and difficult to study. Despite a large amount of work that has gone into the area, the nature and causes of work disability remain complex and befuddled by definitional and methodological problems. Work instability, work impairment, absenteeism, presenteeism, and under- or unemployment are all terms frequently used as outcome measures in studies relating to arthritis and work. Each of these outcome measures are different and may have different explanations. For example, Tillet et al examined the factors that influenced work disability in psoriatic arthritis and found that reduced effectiveness at work was associated with measures of disease activity, whereas unemployment was associated with employer factors, age and disease duration.1 Studies tend to focus heavily on causality or associations (many of these studies are cross-sectional with all their inherent limitations) and relatively few look at prevention or management. So what do we know about work disability and arthritis? First, we know that work disability from arthritis is best understood as a biopsychosocial construct. Multiple elements contribute to this construct. From a biological point of view work disability is dependent on the nature of the disease studied, the severity of that disease in individuals, the duration of the disease and the subsequent accumulated burden of the disease. Personal factors such as the age of the individual, the presence or absence of comorbidities (especially their psychological health), educational status, a second income in the home and the presence of dependents all impact on the likelihood or otherwise of work disability. Social factors contributing to work disability include the nature of and ability to access social security, and the economic climate of the day. Additionally, the nature of the work involved, the presence of meaningful support in the workplace and workplace flexibility and work modification may all impact on an individual's ability to stay at work. How many of these elements contribute to any one individuals' work status will vary across the life of the individual as well as where (and when) they live. The study by Abu Baker et al2 contributes to our knowledge in this area by examining the experience of a cohort of Malaysian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. This is quite a specific population to study, and yet given the variables involved in determining work disability, it is important for Malaysia to understand what is happening in their own population and socio-political environment. This study found high rates of work disability in this cohort, mainly in patients with higher disease activity and the presence of renal involvement and organ damage. However, despite all the methodological challenges, we do know the burden of work disability in patients with arthritis is very significant. We know for example, that in one study 37% of Dutch patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reported being work-disabled compared to 9% of the general Dutch population3 and in Britain RA patients are 32 times more likely to stop working compared with controls.4 We also know that despite work disability being very important to our patients,5 it is frequently ignored or not given sufficient importance by clinicians.6 What about the effects of treatment? There is some evidence that early treatment might reduce the impact of inflammatory disease on work disability.7 A number of studies have looked at the role of biologics specifically and their impact on work disability. These studies have been the subject of at least one systematic review suggesting that their introduction may have had a possible benefit on work disability.8 However, many studies on this topic are confounded by disease severity, with sicker patients tending to use biologics more frequently that less severely ill patients. Also, the heterogeneity of the populations, study designs and outcome measures make it difficult to compare or combine these studies. Although the degree of work impairment in inflammatory arthritis might be falling, this improvement may not relate entirely to the increased use of biologic agents. Rather, it might relate to more intensive and earlier disease control9 and other factors such as changes in access to social security10 or changes in a country's economic climate. This is where studies such as that by Claudepierre et al11 are valuable. Although the follow up was insufficient to look at the impact of these medications on long-term unemployment rates, the prospective nature and real-life experience of the cohort clearly demonstrates a positive benefit on work productivity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis when using biologic agents. An area of potential for reducing work disability in chronic disease is workplace intervention. We know that workplace support is likely to be beneficial for retaining people in the workplace but the precise nature of this support is difficult to define or study. Does workplace support translate into flexibility of tasks and hours? Does it involve permanently altering workplaces or retraining individuals? Is the mere fact of employers and colleagues expressing their support for their colleagues during the acute phases of their illness enough? Do we need to re-examine our social security systems and orientate them to encourage people to stay at work, rather than simply give them support when they are absent from work? Do we need new services orientated toward better managing people's work disabilities before they become permanent, as suggested for Britain by Dame Carol Black?12 There are important questions here which may best lend themselves to qualitative research approaches and largely remain unanswered. Finally, no discussion on the work impact of arthritis would be complete without reference to the burden of disease from osteoarthritis (OA). Evidence is mounting that the work loss from OA is significant and increasing with our aging demographics. For example a recent study from Canada suggested that OA may also contribute significantly to the burden of work impairment from arthritis and this is likely to worsen over the next 5 years.13 Given its prevalence in the community, even relatively small excesses in work disability are likely to contribute significantly to the overall burden. Combining this with the suggestion from a recent US study that disability from OA may be more recalcitrant to medical intervention compared to inflammatory disease,14 then we have another significant musculoskeletal contributor to the overall burden of work disability.",

      "title": "Untethered lives: Barriers to societal integration as predictors of the sexual orientation disparity in suicidality",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite increasing legal protections and supportive attitudes toward sexual minorities (e.g., those who identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual [LGB]) in recent decades, suicidality remains more common among this population than among heterosexuals. While barriers to societal integration have been widely theorized as determinants of suicidality for the general population, they have not been comprehensively explored to explain the sexual orientation disparity in suicidality and/or compared to more established contributors. Methods Data come from the cross-sectional Swedish National Public Health Survey, which randomly collected data from individuals (16-84 years of age) annually from 2010 to 2015 (1,281 (2.2%) self-identified as LGB). Analyses examined sexual orientation differences in suicidality (i.e., past-12-month ideation and attempts), and explored the role of barriers to societal integration (i.e., not living with a partner or children, unemployment, and lack of societal trust) in explaining this disparity over-and-above more commonly explored psychological (e.g., depression, substance use) and interpersonal (e.g., discrimination, victimization, lack of social support) suicidality risk factors. Results Compared to heterosexuals, suicidal ideation and attempts were more common among both gay men/lesbians (AORideation: 2.51; AORattempts: 4.66), and bisexuals (AORideation: 3.76; AORattempts: 6.06). Barriers to societal integration mediated the association between sexual orientation and suicidality even in models adjusting for established risk factors for suicidality. Conclusions The disproportionate barriers to societal integration that LGB individuals experience seem important contributors to the elevated risk of suicidality among sexual minorities. Preventive interventions should consider innovative ways to foster societal integration within sexual minority populations and to adjust hetero-centric social institutions to better include sexual minorities.",

Instead, I propose that the ethics of justice and care are simply descriptions of the virtues of justice and care, understood richly and broadly. Each prescribes perceptions, values, self–conceptions, etc. as well as actions and passions in every sphere of human life. Like other actual (rather than idealized) virtues, justice and care sometimes conflict with each other. They demand incompatible actions, passions, perceptions, etc. The available options in conflict situations feel both right and wrong because they are admirably immoral acts and/or dirty hands acts.

Older lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons must not only overcome the challenges confronting all other persons, but they must also contend with double discrimination based on the stigma linked to their sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics. Specific human rights challenges for LGBTQ+ persons are not explicitly addressed in existing international human rights treaties, just as human rights challenges to older persons generally are largely ignored in the international human rights framework. As a result, insufficient attention has been given to the intersection of ageism and age discrimination with discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identify and gender expression and older LGBTQ+ persons remain vulnerable to aggravated and/or specific forms of discrimination, violence and stigmatization and have grown distrustful of state institutions as their socio-economic situations have fallen behind those of their older non-LGBTQ+ counterparts. This chapter discusses various adverse human rights challenges for older LGBTQ+ persons relating to abuse and violence, economic insecurity and poverty, housing, social networks and community, health, food insecurity, emergencies, institutional discrimination and lack of research and data.",

      "title": "Toward a Psychosocial and Sociocultural Understanding of Achievement Motivation among Latino Gang Members in U. S. Schools",
      "abstract": "Gang members tend to drop out of school, commit crimes, and engage in other delinquent behaviors at rates far exceeding those of the general population, and the Latino component of the U.S. gang member population constitutes up to 40 percent (and even more in some cases) of the urban Latino population in some areas. Many in mainstream society characterize Latino gang members as psychopathic and sociopathic, yet understand relatively little about them. This paper examines some of the psychosocial and sociocultural developmental theories and research regarding the delinquent achievement orientation of Latino gang members and their involvement in gangs. This examination demonstrates the thesis that the Latino gang member orientation and motivation towards the achievement of delinquent behavior, largely perceived as deviant by mainstream society, is actually an alternative response to repellent conditions. This response, often seen as abnormal by society as a whole, is a perception of achievement from within a diverted context that is misunderstood by many within mainstream society, a perception of abnormal or delinquent achievement behavior, such as dropping out of school or committing crime, as the norm or standard to attain. Ameliorative efforts (including prevention, intervention, and suppression) on the part of society and social institutions (particularly the schools) should be utilized in producing salient salutary changes. Gang members have long been perceived as one of the most intractable banes of society. They tend to drop out of school, commit crimes, and engage in other delinquent behaviors at rates far exceeding those of the general population (Asbury, 1928; Belitz & Valdez, 1994; Jankowski, 1991; New York City Criminal Justice Agency, 1989; Suarez-Orozco, 1989; Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 1995b; Vigil, 1988a). Many in mainstream society characterize gang members as psychopathic and sociopathic, yet understand relatively little about them. Upon being asked, many in society will respond to the question of why gang members behave the way do with a simplistic they just want to cause trouble or they are stuck within a low SES (socioeconomic status). Historically, gangs have existed among various ethnic communities in the United States, including gangs in numerous Latino, African American, Asian, and White (non-Latino, Anglo and non-Anglo) communities (Asbury, 1928; Jankowski, 1991; Moore, 1985; New York City Criminal Justice Agency, 1989; Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 1995b; Thrasher, 1927; Vigil, 1988a). Such historical examples would include ethnic gangs of Mexican, Chinese, Irish, and Polish ancestry. Contemporary examples would include the preceding four groups, as well as such diverse cases as Dominican, Vietnamese, and Russian gangs (Friedman, 2000; Jankowski, 1991; Vigil & Yun, 1990), including scenarios in which potential gang recruits of less commonly gang-affiliated ethnic backgrounds are incorporated into more established ethnic gangs in an alternative form of U.S. equal opportunity (Suarez-Orozco, 1989; Suarez-Orozco, 1999; Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 1995b; Vigil, 1988a). U.S. Latino gangs, however, have existed since the increase in Latin American immigration to the U.S. earlier in the twentieth century and the concomitant society-imposed marginalization that quickly accompanied that increase (Buriel, 1984; Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 1995b; Vigil, 1988a, 1999; for a percipient analysis of pariah group status, see De Vos & Suarez-Orozco, 1990; for an acute examination of similar statuses as relate to children of immigrants, see Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 2001). Presently, the U.S. gang member population's Latino component (much of which contains members that tend to average between 13 and 25 years of age [Vigil, 1988a]) constitutes a substantial portion of the Latino population in the United States, particularly in the inner city (Buriel, 1984; Calabrese & Noboa, 1995; Derbyshire, 1968; Jankowski, 1991; Suarez-Orozco & Suarez-Orozco, 1995b; Vigil, 1988a, 1988b, 1999), as the numbers attest. …",

      "title": "The Size of Inequality and Its Badness Some reflections around Temkin's <i>Inequality</i>",
      "abstract": "Abstract This paper puts forward the following claims: (i) The size of inequality in welfare should be distinguished from its badness. (ii) The size of a pairwise inequality between two individuals can be measured by the absolute or the relative welfare distance between their welfare levels, but it does not depend on the welfare levels of other individuals. (iii) The size of inequality in a social state may be understood either as the degree of pairwise inequality or as its amount. (iv) The badness of a pairwise inequality may differ from its size in several ways; for example, the badness measure might go by the distance between priority‐transformed welfare levels and/or it might assign heavier weight to larger distances. (v) The badness of a pairwise inequality may be either personal or impersonal, with the personal interpretation being internally consistent and, pace Temkin, independently tenable even if we reject the so‐called Slogan (i.e., the Person‐Affecting Claim). (vi) The aggregation procedure by which we arrive from the badness of pairwise inequalities to the badness of the inequality in a social state takes different forms depending on whether the badness of a pairwise inequality is interpreted in a personal or in an impersonal way. (vii) Since Temkin's complaint‐based measures of the badness of inequality follow the format appropriate for the personal interpretation, they seem out of place if one, like him, treats the badness of inequality as an impersonal value.",

      "abstract": "During the third age, rehabilitative intervention has some particular characteristics, connected to, without any doubt, functional and biological characteristics, which are typical of this period of human life, and on the other side, connected to the common way to consider elderly people, by the elderly people themselves, by the caregivers and by the social community.\r\n\r\nToo often pain, functional limitation, reduction of autonomy and of capacity to participate in life are considered normal, almost necessary, and accepted with resignation and without any opposition.\r\n\r\nThis common idea of the elderly person is in contrast with scientific literature data, which show only the request of a longer time in more young people to reach the goals and for their reintegration, without having serious cognitive deficits or important pathologies.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, fighting to change this negative common point of view about elderly age is a challenge belonging to “rehabilitation”. Consequently it’s important to improve the capacity of the elderly person (for example in a global vision like the bio-physical-social one proposed by ICF.\r\n\r\nIn a femur fracture, a hip replacement or a osseous synthesis surgery are less meaningful if they can’t bring the patient to walk, to stand up, to sit down, to climb the stairs and take care of himself, like he did before his trauma. If the interdisciplinary work of the rehabilitation team is well done and appropriate (from the beginning soon after the trauma and the surgery), if it is constant and sufficiently protracted, it must and can warrant this result. Besides it must involve not only the elderly patient who does rehabilitation but also his family and the institutional environment that surrounds him.\r\n\r\n“Rehabilitation” has another challenge: to improve physical and functional conditions of elderly people to limit the use of drugs and surgery interventions. We are talking about interventions on osteoarthritis patients, but especially regarding intervention for the reduction of changeable risk factors of falls, which are the most frequent cause of fracture and its negative complications, including death.\r\n\r\nWe have a double strategy: one is to intervene on the elderly population in general with AFA; the other one is to intervene on high risk elderly people through a specific work.\r\n\r\nThese kinds of interventions are normally collocated in the strict cooperation between hospital or university structures and local health service structures.",

      "abstract": "The dilemma of age estimation of children and juveniles in South AfricaTo the Editor: Requests for medical practitioners to perform age estimations in children and juveniles without formal documentation in South Africa (SA) are usually made by the courts or social workers in line with the provisions of the Child Justice Act. [1]he involved individuals may be undocumented SA childrenpossibly abandoned or in conflict with the law, or, more commonly, unaccompanied or separated foreign minors with no proof of their chronological age.Age defines the relationship between an individual and the state and, in turn, the protection and/or support to which an individual may be entitled. [2]The possible ramifications of age estimations are quite serious and may, and do, often infringe on the involved individual's rights, including the possibility that a child will not receive support from the state if deemed an adult.There may be no protection for a child from detention or their wrongful incarceration with adults.Conversely, an adult, incorrectly assessed to be a child, may expose children to risk when placed in a children's environment. [2]4] In SA, it is stated in section 13 of the Child Justice Act that if, during an assessment of a child, the age of the child is uncertain, the probation officer must make an age estimation.It further states that the probation officer can use certain information such as previous age determinations, statements by the parents or the child, school documents, baptism or other religious certificates, or age estimations by medical practitioners.The probation officer must submit the age estimation on a prescribed form to the inquiry magistrate and the estimation can be changed before the child is sentenced, if more information regarding the child's age arises. [1]No further guidance with regard to the experience or qualifications of the medical practitioner or how and where these assessments should be done is provided.This leaves the procedure open for individual and subjective interpretation and the application thereof.There is no consistency in this practice across SA.In Cape Town, when children and juveniles are referred to medical practitioners for an age estimation, these assessments are usually done by clinical forensic practitioners, and consist of a physical examination and completion of a set form: Form 7 -Medical report and age assessment of child in terms of section 48(2) of the Children's Act, 2005 (Act no.38 of 2005).Requests for age estimations are increasing with regard to the increased number of immigrants.From January to June 2016, 37 children were referred for age estimations to the Clinical Forensic Unit at Victoria Hospital, Cape Town.No published data are available on the estimated number of foreign undocumented children in SA.According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)",

      "abstract": "In the course of human development, children learn to acknowledge certain realities and to distinguish these from fantasy, while at the same time they are permitted to ignore or even deny certain other realities in the interest of maintaining an adequate degree of psychological equilibrium. We know that recognition of the psychological sense of self as distant from the other is achieved in most infants during the second half of the first year of life. The child's dyadic relationship slowly merges into the oedipal triadic relationship with the parents by the end of the fourth year, ushering in a severely conflictual situation for children of both sexes. Curiosity about sexuality gives way, under reasonably adequate psychological conditions, to curiosity about the wider aspects of the world, a sublimation of a portion of sexual as well as aggressive wishes that continues into adult life unless inhibitions arise because of psychological conflicts that were insufficiently resolved during the pre-oedipal and oedipal periods.",

      "abstract": "Blood samples are often used to investigate the possible presence of disease and to make treatment decisions.In the interpretation of the results, comparison either with previous values from the same individual or with a set of appropriate group-based reference intervals are used.Current reference intervals for common laboratory analytes are often based on measurements from apparently healthy persons aged 18-65 years.Age is accompanied by a general decline in organ functions and it is difficult to determine whether a change in levels of laboratory analytes in an elderly individual can be attributed to age alone, independent of environmental or disease processes.Frailty can be seen as a consequence of age-related multifactorial deterioration -physical, cognitive and sensory -resulting in vulnerability and lack of adaptability to internal stressors such as infection or new medication and/or external stressors such as fall at home.Consensus about the definition of \"frail\" and \"frailty\" is missing, both nationally and internationally, the question arises whether different definitions of \"frailty\" affect the interpretation of analytes when comparing different groups of elderly.The overarching aim of the thesis was to interpret and assess circulating levels of some clinical laboratory analytes in relation to conventional reference values in ≥80-year-old, \"apparently healthy\", \"moderately healthy\", and \"frail\" individuals.Data originated from other studies, in which blood samples were collected from individuals ≥80-year-old.Comparisons in Paper I of levels of some laboratory analytes, from 138 nursing home residents (NHRs), was made with blood from reference populations, both blood donor and the NORIP study.The results indicated differences for some immunological (complement factor 3 and 4, immunoglobulin G and M) and chemical analytes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), phosphate, albumin, sodium, creatinine and urea), but no differences in levels occurred for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).It was unclear whether the differences were due to differences in age between the elderly and the reference populations or whether the elderly individuals had chronic diseases and were on medication.In Paper II, 569 individuals elderly individuals ≥80 years old were classified as \"healthy\", \"moderately healthy\", and \"frail\", based on diseases, medications and physical and cognitive abilities.Statistical differences between the groups were found for the investigated analytes; albumin, ALT, AST, creatinine and γ-GT.In Paper IV, individuals from Paper II (n=569) were divided into two groups and thereafter divided into \"apparently healthy\", \"moderately healthy\", and \"frail\".One group was subdivided into \"apparently healthy\", \"moderately healthy\" and \"frail\" based on physical and cognitive abilities and the other group was divided based on the frailty index (FI).There was no statistical difference found between \"apparently healthy\" and \"moderately healthy\" groups, regardless of classification model used.Among \"frail\" individuals, differences in levels occurred for three out of the five investigated analytes: ALT, creatinine and g-GT, with lower levels occurring when the FI classification model was used.No differences in levels occurred for albumin or AST in \"frail\" individuals, regardless of classification model used.The aim of Paper III was to study whether 1-year changes in complete blood count (CBC) (including haemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC), white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count (PLT)), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 are associated with survival in elderly NHRs aged >80 years.Elevated levels of CRP and IL-8 during 1-year follow-up were associated with reduced length of survival in elderly NHRs.Based on the present thesis it is clear that there is need for reference intervals that consider both age and health status in elderly individuals.A reasonable conclusion when interpreting levels of analytes in elderly individuals with disease or frailty is that individual evaluation based on the individual's previous levels, is recommended.

      "abstract": "The need to define dependence arises out of accumulating evidence that it contributes to depression‐proneness. Its accurate definition is therefore a prerequisite for the development of valid methods of measuring it. Because dependence is more a feature of childhood than of adulthood, a dependent person may usefully be viewed as an adult behaving as though he were a child. Dependence is best understood therefore in terms of those developmental deficiencies from which it results. These are failure to separate successfully from the principal parent figure and from the family as a whole, failure to establish a secure personal identity, failure to acquire a general feeling of competence and a realistic assessment of self‐worth and failure to feel deserving of the status of adult and to feel on equal terms with other adults. Consequently, adult dependence is characterized by the need to stay close to others, the inclination to be primarily the recipient in interpersonal transactions and the tendency to relate to others from a position of inferiority and humility. The dependent person receives from others a borrowed identity, guidance and direction, compensation for those areas in which he is incompetent and, most important of all, acceptance, approval and affirmation of worth.",

      "abstract": "My thesis seeks to reduce what may be a natural human antipathy to ageing and/or the elderly by working with one distinctive and consistently approved feature of some older people. This feature is a bold and cheerful struggle within a self‐chosen project. The argument opens by distinguishing short‐term gratification from lasting, fulfilling happiness, and showing the link between gratification and dependence. Three kinds of struggle (non‐voluntary, part‐voluntary and positive) are then outlined and exemplified. Gerontological and anthropological research suggest that attitudes to struggle are fixed early in life, and while in the past they mitigated for or against successful survival, they now influence happiness and coping in later life. I argue that the negative effects of the first two kinds of struggle ‐ which are often misguided, grudging or ‘no‐win’ struggles ‐ are responsible for the rigidity, narcissism and resentment disliked in some older people. Self‐respect, contrasted with self‐righteousness, is shown to accrue only from the positive (voluntary and congenial) struggle that seems at any age to deflect or compensate for depression, disappointment, loneliness and illness.",

      "abstract": "Violence has posed a variety of discussions, as to its nature and its effects upon society. A demarcation lies between a negative assessment and a positive one. In the former point of view one may direct his attention solely to the violence being identified with crimes. One may attempt to list up violence cases and a variety of punishments imposed upon them. The punishments will disclose the specific values underlying the indigenous ways of thinking and behaving as well as certain specific conditions in the society. One may, however, be likely to devote oneself to a mere classification and a description of the crimes and punishments and will not go further to analize their causes. Another may have a slightly flexible point of view and study violence in connection with social maladaptation. Those who deviated from the social norms or failed to be successful or prosperous in their work tend to be frustrated and are inclined to burst into irrational conducts. In this view one interrelates social deviation and mental depression with the causes of violence cases. One may pose a positive assessment of violence. Any sporadic and individual exercise of physical force may be identified with an offence. The organized use of it, however, comes to be a socially recognized act. Few can deny the usefulness of such physical forces as police and army in the maintenance of social conformity and solidarity. Their existence and activities are never de-",

      "abstract": "misconduct could place a strain on family ties, but if so, the effect is not great enough to give clear statistical signs. If differences between future repeaters and confirmed repeaters are an indication of change, however, there is a shift in the way the boy is treated by the schools and the police. His grades apparently drop as he is more visibly delinquent, and he is likely to be shunted into special schools for behavior problem children. As a consequence he tends to be increasingly discontented with school. Also, the police apparently are more inclined to be suspicious of him. Both of these trends are almost inevitable social consequences of frequently getting in trouble. Whether or not they also raise the likelihood of further repeating is a possibility which merits further investigation. Related to the above trends is the shift away from adult-supervised youth groups and toward either gang activity or its opposite extreme, isolation. Here, again, the finding should be no surprise. The leaders of youth groups are understandably impatient with trouble-makers and may encourage them to leave organizations. Meanwhile, as a youngster gets in trouble frequently he may get to know more boys with a similar propensity to mischief. If he goes to a special school and spends time in detention his social contacts may become specialized. In many neighborhoods he may be isolated as less delinquent youngsters steer clear of him and of the trouble associated with him. In summary, then, a comparison between a predictive study of juvenile repeating and a retrospective study of the same phenomenon would indicate that home and neighborhood conditions alter only slightly, but school, police, and peer-group relations become worse. In this way, the repeater is propelled toward more serious delinquency not only by the forces which started him on his way but also by more intensified pressures in other areas of his life.",

Biologically, sex hormones and nucleus accumbent neurotransmitters (mainly testosterone and dopamine) govern human desire. Working, family, mentality, and stress might affect libido. Medical disorders, drugs, lifestyle, relationships, and age might affect libido (e.g., puberty). Hypersexuality is having frequent or suddenly increased sexual impulses; hyposexuality is the opposite. In psychoanalytic thought, libido is a mental drive or energy, connected with sexual instinct but is also present in other innate urges. A man may want sex but not be able to act on it, or may not for medical, moral, or religious reasons. Repressing or sublimating an urge is psychological. One can participate in sexual activity without a sire. Stress, illness, and pregnancy affect sperm drive. Testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, and norepinephrine act as serotonin This book chapter talks about how functional foods such as spinach, dark chocolate, peppers, green tea, oysters, crab, and pumpkin seeds, which contain neurotransmitters, affect libido.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical transitional period in every teenager’s life and is marked by a plethora of physiological, physical and psychological changes, as well as a melange of polar emotions. Adolescents tend to seek autonomy from parental figures and want independence in domains of education and decision making. Furthermore, as explained in Erik Erikson’s psychosocial stages in 1968 of development, adolescents search for their personal identity and seek to achieve their sense of the self. This is marked by a phase of exploration – the experimental stage that is called the ‘moratorium’ – which, if marked by successful identity achievement, may lead to the formation of one’s own set of beliefs on what is right and wrong, their own moral system. This success is marked by a formed sense of the self, which allows adolescents to accept individual differences and keep them from conforming to societal pressures. An alternate outcome of this phase is ‘identity crisis’, which causes an adolescent to have an unclear sense of the self and it leads to a prolonged stage of experimentation, in the journey to find oneself. This may be dangerous if it leads to delinquency, substance abuse, eating disorders, etc. The primary aim of this study is to examine the difference in adjustment and happiness between students of middle school (age 12-14 years) and high school (age 15-18 years). The sample size consists of 30 middle school and 30 high school students. Tests employed were ‘Satisfaction With Life Scale’ based on ‘subjective well-being’ by Ed Diener (1984). Following the collection of data, the raw scores were analyzed using Ed Diener’s standardized analysis for SWLS.",

About 15% of children at the age of 2 years demonstrate a lower level of speech expression than their peers. Speech development disorders may constitute either symptoms of global developmental delay or only isolated difficulties. One of the main challenges for professionals dealing with early development support is recognizing whether a child whose linguistic competence differs significantly from that of their peers suffers from a specific language impairment, or whether they belong to the group of ‘late bloomers’ who at some point, without the intervention of a specialist, will achieve an appropriate level of communication skills. Although a differential diagnosis can be extremely difficult, the analysis of the literature leads to the conclusion that there are some markers that can aid a specialist in establishing an accurate diagnosis.",

The current increasing tendency is also quite noticeable in our country，which have resulted in a strong growth in the elderly population aged 65 and older. ln the third age，sustaining a happy sexual life would be closely related to the establishment of self respect and self-preservation. so， therefore， in the field of the clinical geropsychotogical counseling， the parts of sexual life that are not brought to light should be regarded as a subject of prime importance. Before everything. in clinical geropsychological counseling，whether or not medical illness which could cause sexual problems exist should be ascertained. If they suffer from such medical illness，it should be properly managed before the counseler could take up the main subject, The elderly who lose one's husband or wife should be encouraged to have good chances to contact，meet. and even marry a new partner. In order to provide sound opportunities to the elderly and creat a elderly-friendly social environment it would be necessary for professionals who have adequate experiences in geropsychotogical sexual counseling and professional institutes which deals with the geropsychology sexual conflict to come forth in large numbers. In case of psychosocial problems，the elderly should be consulted with professional doctors immediately. Professional doctors who have the necessary competence of open-heartedness ， catholicity, and expertise would help Ihe elderly envisage Iheir problems squarely. Pro1essional doctors，other professionals who would be engaged in geropsychological sexual counseling ，and even generat geriatric care givers should hold on to the uncritical attutude toward the personal sexual orientation and individual characteristic of sexual behavior of the elderly.",

Individuals who are poor are confronted with an unremitting succession of negative life events in the context of chronically stressful, ongoing life conditions such as inadequate housing and dangerous neighborhoods. Adults who are poor also have more mental health problems than their economically advantaged counterparts. The inverse relation between socioeconomic status and various forms of psychological distress and mental disorder is due in part to the increased exposure of the poor to chronic and acute stressors. Vulnerability to stress following negative life events is reported to be higher among African Americans than whites. African Americans may be more distressed than whites at low levels of income because their caste-like inferiorized status thwarts mobility aspirations and results in greater exposure to chronic, ongoing stressors and higher levels of resource deprivation.",

Sociosexuality occurs in primates (prosimians, monkeys, and apes) in many forms including urinary marking, facial expressions, vocalizations, grooming, playing, mounting, and anogenital sniffing, touching, inspecting, and rubbing. Sociosexual behavior takes place between individuals of various combinations of ages and sexes. In some species such as bonobos, sociosexual activity starts in infancy and can occur as many as 30 times a day, while in other species like chimpanzees, it starts later in life and is less frequent. Sociosexual behavior can take the form of sexual competition—competition between members of the same sex for a mate in the form of fighting or even blocking ovulation in less‐dominant individuals. Sociosexuality is interpreted as strengthening relationships, acts of dominance, reparation after fights, and reducing tension. Most data on nonhuman primate sociosexuality indicate that behaviors occurring outside of reproduction may increase future matings and/or reproductive success.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Can aggression be studied in an ethical manner? Aggression is a behavior found almost universally in the animal kingdom. It is defined as a hostile act that poses a threat to another creature. It is exhibited in many ways, including threatening body movements, vocalization, fighting, wounding and inflicting pain, sexual attack, and killing. Commonly, animals act aggressively to exclude others from their territory, to capture food, or to control populations. Displays of aggression are influenced by age (newborns and infants below a certain age do not show aggression), by the physical environment, by previous social experience, and by the aggression level in a particular community. One manifestation of aggression is infanticide—the killing of infants by adults. It occurs in several species of animal. Human infanticide is practiced in several cultures to control population, to favor the birth of a particular sex (usually male), and in waging war. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, biologists reported anecdotal observations of infanticide in both male and female wild animals.",

However, this sense of for the most part arises out of their general professional orientation rather than clearly spelled out or legally established policy.

Honour killings or crime against humanity has risen to prominence in recent years and is a global phenomenon. The punishments for cases obviously vary from society to society as per the nature and extent of the defiance and dishonour. Honour killing is the result of  socio-psychological milieu of cynical societies where some acts of the behavior of human beings especially of the females are recognized as making dishonour to their families and communities and the lost honour is recovered by killings them. Honour killing is the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members due to the perception of the perpetrators that the victim has brought dishonour upon the family or community. The pseudo dishonour is generally the result of the unaccepted behaviors or the suspicion of such behaviors like desiring to terminate or prevent an arranged marriage or inter-caste marriage, inter-religion marriage, ‘sagotra’ marriage, desiring to marry by own choice or against the wishes of their family especially if to the member of a society deemed inappropriate, engaging in hetero-sexual acts outside marriage, adultery and engaging in homosexual acts etc. It is the menacing phenomena of repressive social practices in the name of honor triggering violent reaction from the influential members of community who are blind to individual autonomy. The ‘honour killings’ or ‘honour crimes’ are not peculiar to our country. It is an evil which haunts many other societies also and a global problem. Honour killings, for whatever reason needs immediate attention. Law needs to be used as a weapon to curb social evil. What is needed is a firm decision by the government for a separate law. There is paucity of research studies in this area. The networking of the police, judiciary, government, NGOs, human rights activists, sociologists, social workers, and psychologists is to be done in order to mitigate this social evil. Honour killing cannot be accepted in the name of culture or tradition. Honour killing is unjust and inhumane action. It is crime against mankind.

Namun masa remaja juga identik dengan dengan kata ‘pemberontakan’, dalam istilah psikologi sering disebut sebagai masa storm and stress karena banyaknya goncangan-goncangan dan perubahan-perubahan yang cukup radikal dari masa sebelumnya. Pencarian jati diri seseorang terjadi pada masa remaja, namun di masa remaja seseorang dapat terjerumus ke dalam kehidupan yang dapat merusak masa depan mereka, mengkonsumsi minuman beralkohol dan terlibat konflik merupakan kenakalan yang sering dilakukan oleh anak remaja. Perilaku mengkonsumsi minuman beralkohol di kalangan remaja, seringkali membahayakan diri sendiri dan juga orang lain. Remaja tersebut juga sering terlibat konflik sebagai akibat dari mengkonsumsi minuman beralkohol. Akibat dari mengkonsumsi minuman beralkohol, seseorang menjadi tidak terkontrol lagi dalam berbicara, bertindak dan mudah tersinggung, hal tersebut tentu saja dapat menimbulkan terjadinya konflik.\r\nTujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui jenis-jenis konflik dalam kaitannya dengan perilaku remaja yang mengkonsumsi minuman beralkohol, untuk mengetahui faktor-faktor penyebab konflik dalam kaitannya dengan perilaku remaja yang mengkonsumsi minuman beralkohol, untuk mengetahui dampak dari konflik dalam kaitannya dengan perilaku remaja yang mengkonsumsi minuman beralkohol serta untuk mengetahui upaya mengatasi konflik dalam kaitannya dengan perilaku remaja yang mengkonsumsi minuman beralkohol.\r\nPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian deskriptif kualitatif.

Loneliness is not linked with social isolation, solitude, or aloneness. When low levels of social contact are desired, they may be experienced as positive. Loneliness is associated with mental illness. Loneliness is an emotionally unpleasant experience. It causes dissatisfaction, unhappiness, and depression. Anxiety, emptiness, boredom, restlessness, and marginality are the offshoot of loneliness. Divorce and the breakup of dating relationships are all associated with loneliness. Physical separation from family and friends drives one at risk for loneliness. Retirement, unemployment, and reduced satisfaction may also precipitate loneliness.",

      "abstract": "The development of theories of and attitudes surrounding adolescent alcohol abuse was explored by asking students from sixth grade to college to react to a hypothetical case of problem drinking. With age, students perceived the problem as less serious; less often attributed it to moral weakness, but displayed little change in their endorsement of causal views emphasizing biological disease, bad environment, or normal motives; more often emphasized the individual's own responsibility for solving the problem and the value of self-initiated and nonpunitive treatment; and expressed more acceptance of the problem drinker. In addition, males were more likely than females to normalize and tolerate problem drinking. Deviance from adult-sanctioned, conventional values, although a contributor to tolerant views ofproblem drinking in its own right, could accountfor only some age and gender differences in perceptions. Implications for substance abuse education are discussed.",

It is not just the number of relationships, but also the quality of these social ties, that influence loneliness. Being close with companions and family members is essential for the elderly. Additional factors, such as being female, having a low socioeconomic status, or being institutionalized can raise loneliness among the elderly. Loneliness can have a noteworthy influence on the well-being of the elderly, leading to depression and even death. There are several existing interventions to tackle loneliness, but their significance is minimal. This article aims to raise awareness of the epidemic called senior isolation.",

However, from a review of the cases of 53 male self-mutilators, it appears that a significant number involve individuals not psychotic at the time of the act but rather having character disorders and rageful feelings toward themselves or women, and transsexual males who premeditate their own gender conversion surgery. The psychiatric consultant's role in the management of such an individual in the general hospital setting includes not only care of a patient with a psychotic or impulse disorder but also involves support of the house staff, who are distressed by the fear, guilt, hopelessness, anger, and revulsion that the patient's act of genital self-mutilation causes.",

There are also incidents that happen in both arenas. The most common determinant of bullying's location seems to be the age of the child involved. Bullying today might start only online, with the target wandering around school wondering which kid (or kids) are the mean ones.

Based on longitudinal data of the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS), it is examined whether the probability of being self-employed as well as the probability of an entrepreneurial exit among individuals aged 51-65 is influenced by the presence of a partner, and the underlying mechanisms of this possible influence. The main findings indeed reveal that the presence of a partner positively influences the probability of being self-employed. The positive presence of a partner through paid-employment or self-employment as opposed to unemployment, and very good health as opposed to poor health, increases the likelihood of being self-employed. It is also found that having a partner who works for pay, having a self-employed partner or having a depressed partner, decreases the probability of an entrepreneurial exit. The self-employed are an important class of workers, and these findings contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of being and remaining self-employed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Threat, a central concept in theories of ethnocentric behavior and intergroup conflict, is probably one of the most important factors underlying intergroup hostility or war. Threat can be most broadly defined as the anticipation of negative consequences or loss, either for oneself or one's group, and can involve challenges to power and status, well‐being and security, beliefs and values, or self‐esteem. Threats can originate from an outgroup or from within an ingroup, as well as from more abstract factors in the environment such as economic insecurity or climate change. Psychological analyses of the role of threat emphasize the subjective nature of threat rather than objective threatening conditions. Thus, it is perceived rather than actual threat that affects how people think, feel, and behave. In the context of intergroup relations, experiences of threat often result in negative perceptions of and attitudes toward outgroups, as well as avoidant or confrontational behavioral tendencies. Social psychological research has demonstrated that both threats directed at an ingroup as a whole as well as threats directed at the individual can be consequential for intergroup relations.",

      "title": "ERECTION DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "The first physiological response to effective sexual stimulation, produced by a source of physical or mental stimulation, is the erection of the penis. Erection usually occurs within 3-8 seconds of the onset of arousal. When sexual tension and erection reach a certain level in the presence of the partner, the need for interference appears. The intensity of the erection may increase or decrease until it disappears, whether the arousal is prolonged or not. The complicated anatomical apparatus is regulated by a nervous mechanism, just as complex, being dependent to a remarkable extent on psychic influences. By the strong interweaving of these two components - psychological and functional - the sexual function is subject to changes. Erectile dysfunction, when it occurs, is obvious because, although there may be libido, the lack of an erection makes it impossible to perform sexual intercourse. Erectile dysfunction should not be confused with isolated or occasional failures to obtain or maintain a penile erection. They do not constitute a condition or disease that justifies medical attention and should be perceived as absolutely normal. The vast majority of men face such an episode at some point in their lives. One can speak of erectile dysfunction in the case of a recurrent or persistent inability to obtain an erection or to maintain it long enough to complete sexual intercourse, which lasts at least three months. It is especially important because in a normal activity, without erection, intercourse, ejaculation and orgasm cannot take place. (Pathologically, premature ejaculation can occur, without an erection, in the form of pollution!)",

If development is viewed as an epigenetic process, what the child achieves during the second year rests upon the growth of the first year and might well be lost without further strengthening in the third year. Disregarding cultural differences for the time being and averaging the differences among children in our own culture, one can identify certain areas of development which are expected during this second year. The areas of most rapid growth are locomotion and the refinement of other motor skills, socialization, speech, the development of initiative and autonomy, and of a sense of self. In addition, there comes the recognition that persons and objects remain constant, that is, they continue to exist when out of sight. Control of bowels and urine is such an important component of the socialization process.",

      "abstract": "The provision of informed consent by a patient should be the end point of a process of engagement in which one or more health practitioners have supported the patient to come to an informed decision to agree to the healthcare offered. Informed consent is a means to comply with the principle of respect for the person in a healthcare context. This act can be alternatively interpreted according to a libertarian perspective or according to a more solidaristic one [1]. According to the former perspective, informed consent is tightly linked to the idea that every person is the proprietor of their own body with which they have the absolute right to decide whatever they want done to it. This view leads to the construction of the patient physician relationship founded on a contractual basis. According to the latter perspective, respect for the person implies a special care and not, indifference, so that consent implies the due engagement of the person in the decision process as the very etymology of the word consent suggests. Respect for a person certainly means respect for his or her autonomy, but the former concept does not correspond necessarily with the latter, especially if autonomy is not interpreted within a framework of solidarity and the patient is not sufficiently mature. Otherwise respect would slide into indifference.\r\n\r\nAs for minors, the Oviedo convention prefers to use the word authorisation instead of the common expression consent on behalf of the child. In fact, authorisation relates to the concept of a third authority, such as parental responsibility, which implies a different framework than that of informed consent. This is the concept of the child's best interests as the fundamental criterion of making decisions regarding children. Since informed consent can be seen as an expression of personal choice, it can only be given by the person who is to be provided with health care. Moreover, the Oviedo convention requires that the opinion of the minor shall be taken into consideration. As a result, the decision-making process involves three categories of subjects: the physician who proposes the therapy, the parents who give authorisation and the minor whose opinion “is an increasingly determining factor in proportion of his or her degree of maturity” [2-5]. Further problems can derive from the fragile condition of modern-day families and the related difficulty in parents agreeing on any given issue.",

      "abstract": "The lack of disease-modifying pharmacological agents for dementia highlights the critical importance of prevention, but known modifiable factors (e.g., education, physical health and health behaviors, depression, and social isolation) do not fully represent potential intervention targets. Positive psychosocial factors predict cognitive aging outcomes above and beyond known risk factors and may also correspond to upstream determinants that open up new avenues for prevention and intervention, as well as for reducing racial/ethnic inequalities in dementia. In this brief report, I summarize contemporary evidence for three positive psychosocial factors that appear to be particularly relevant to cognitive aging: perceived control, religious involvement, and social relations.Targeted review and synthesis of published studies.Each of the multidimensional constructs appears to contain \"active ingredients\" that could help to optimize cognitive aging through disparate mechanisms. Although historically marginalized racial/ethnic groups face disproportionate barriers to accessing certain psychosocial protective factors (e.g., perceived control), these same groups also exhibit naturally occurring sources of psychosocial resilience (e.g., religious involvement) that allow them to achieve better late-life cognitive health than would be otherwise expected. With regard to social relations, converging evidence from disparate studies shows that fostering late-life friendships in particular may have high potential for building cognitive reserve and promoting healthy cognitive aging.Positive psychosocial factors represent culturally relevant resources that, through careful research, could ultimately be harnessed to promote better cognitive aging for a growing and increasingly diverse population of older adults.",

Perceived racial harassment is driven by social classifications that extend beyond racial group membership. While race clearly matters, there is also diversity in the harassment experiences of individuals of the same race with diverging organizational, cultural or social experiences. Social prescriptions constraining inter-racial interactions are associated with higher rates of offensive racial encounters and more careerrelated discrimination, while aspects of an installation's institutional culture also directly affect harassment. Together, these results lend support for a model of racial harassment that encompasses both institutional factors and a multifaceted notion of racial identity.",

      "title": "The psychosexual development of urban lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths",
      "abstract": "An examination of cognitive sexual orientation, sexual partner activity, and sexual identity was conducted among 76 lesbian/bisexual female youths and 80 gay/bisexual male youths (age range of 14–21 years) recruited from community‐based or college organizations for lesbian / gay youths in New York City. Self‐identification as lesbian / gay or bisexual changed over time; more than half the youths who identified as lesbian / gay at the interview had considered themselves bisexual in the past, and vice versa. A modal developmental sequence of cognitions and behaviors was found: Most youths first became aware of a cognitive sexual orientation (e.g., attractions and fantasies) toward the same or other sex, then considered a lesbian / gay or bisexual identity, and finally felt certain of a lesbian / gay or bisexual identity. Age at initiation of sexual activity with females or males was inconsistently related to this pattern. Significant gender differences indicated that females were older than males when they first considered (M years of 13.9 and 12.5, respectively) or were certain of (M years of 15.9 and 14.6 years, respectively) being lesbian/gay. The majority of youths had a history of sexual activity with the same sex (88% of females and 95% of males) and the other sex (80% of females and 56% of males). The youths became sexually active during the early adolescent years, both with the same sex and the other sex. Their sexual practices, with the same and other sex, followed an initiation sequence beginning with manual (i.e., hand‐genital) sex during the early teens and ending with anal practices during the middle and late teens. No significant gender differences were found in lifetime prevalence rates or ages at initiating sexual practices with the same sex. Gender differences were found for other‐sex partners: Females became sexually active at an older age than did males, and more females than males engaged in heterosexual activity. No significant differences in the psychosexual variables were found among Black, Hispanic, White, and youths of other ethnic backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "Violence is an act that causes pain, suffering, societal prejudice, humiliation, ostracism, marginalization or even death.Any action carried out intentionally or unintentionally but which affects an individual negatively in an injurious or destructive manner maybe perceived as violence.Violence may be political, social, emotional or religious depending on the situation surrounding a given society.Any form of violence is an abuse of human rights which restricts or denies an individual access to his or her rights in society.Such universal basic rights are rights to live, freedom of thought, speech or religion, freedom of movement, choice, acceptance and security.Unfortunately the girl-child has suffered most in our society, both within the family and other social institutions that are meant to train, educate and socialize her.The girl-child in many African societies, Nigeria not exempt, has been sexually abused, trafficked, denied education, humiliated, oppressed and suppressed.She has been subjected to various forms of gender-based violence such as domestic violence, cultural violence, rape, forced prostitution and forced early marriage.These impinge on the growth, rights and physical well being of the female gender especially the girl child, with huge and grave consequences.The thrust of this paper is to see the extent the girl-child has been exposed to violence, how far she suffers and is still suffering from one form of violence to another.The paper concludes that despite the violence prohibition Act of 2015 the girl-child is still very much subjected to violence and if definite steps are not put into action the girl-child will continue to be deprived of her rights.",

      "abstract": "Narcotics addiction is both a psychophysiological state and a social category. It is a product of behavior learned within a social context and cannot be adequately understood apart from that context. The prevalence and consequences of drug addiction in any society depend as much upon the social and legal definitions placed upon the nonmedical use of narcotics as upon the nature and effects of narcotics or the nature of persons who become addicted. These definitions generally evolve in harmony with the general orientations of the society toward various types of experience, though in some instances, they may be imposed by groups having special interests in and concerns about the problem of narcotics use and addiction. In contemporary North America, narcotics addiction tends to be regarded with horror. The dope fiend and the drug peddler are subject in the popular mind to the same loathing and abhorrence that attaches to the sex maniac. The addict's apparent lack of will power and rejection of goals other than the support of his drug habit are utterly antithetical to the Protestant ethic, with its injunction to moral responsibility and striving. Intensifying the strong social disapprobation of the addict has been the change in legal definition attaching to drug use and drug possession since passage of the Harrison Act in 1914.1 The maintenance of addiction now requires that one be a criminal, whereas addicted persons could previously obtain their drugs at very low cost through legitimate drug channels. This action was, of course, designed to protect the population against the dangers of addiction through innocent medicinal use or self-experimentation with narcotic drugs. Coupled with the new legal definition of drug use, however, came the designation of the addict as enemy by enforcement personnel and the solidifying of underworld ties and identifications on the part of many addicts. Thus, stereotypes of the addict were reshaped and widely circulated and, to a degree, they were confirmed by the subsequent responses of addicts forced to work out new modes of survival.

      "abstract": "A family is an institution where a person acquires all social roles and behaviour patterns. One of the main factors destroying a family’s harmony is domestic violence. Violence against children is a relevant issue in all countries. The extent of this problem is increased by the established opinion of society that the family’s problems are only its business. They are not made public, and the family itself must solve the problems within its environment. Empirical data were analysed after conducting qualitative research based on a semi-structured interview, which allowed a better understanding of an individual, delving into her problems and clarifying the need for assistance and its importance in her personal life. Content analysis was applied after conducting the research. The research involved 8 women who experienced various punishments as a means of upbringing in childhood. The research revealed that the causes of violence against children in a close environment often do not depend on children’s behaviour or other characteristics related to them. Violent families often live below the poverty line and have alcohol addiction or other social problems. Parents are usually violent because they were abused as children, and they consider it an acceptable way of communication and parenting. The consequences of violence against children are obvious and range from low self-esteem to self-harm and suicide. Children who have experienced violence in their close environment often become abusers themselves. It has been determined that in their childhood, the respondents who participated in the research experienced all four forms of violence distinguished in the scientific literature: physical, psychological, sexual, and neglect. However, it has been revealed that the majority of the respondents did not seek help because, at the time when they were children, there was little talk about children’s rights and methods of raising children. If corporal punishment occurred, it was considered to be one of the generally used and acceptable methods of raising children.",

There are important neurological networks developing at preschool age related to perspective taking about the attribution of belief and to deduction with contrary-to-fact situations. Other deductive abilities may be completed during that period.A group of very prematurely born children (N = 35) aged between 4 and 5 years was compared with a control group of children born at full term (N = 35). They completed different cognitive tasks that required making inferences about possible true facts and false facts, and about others' beliefs.Results showed that preterm children had more difficulties with false beliefs and counterfactual tasks than the controls but they did not differ in equivalent deductive tasks.We discuss the possible difficulties of preterm children when they first reach primary school age, not only with social perspective taking, but also with considering nonsocial contrary-to-fact alternatives. Prematurity is not a syndrome, but could be a risk condition. Therefore, these results are relevant in the field of differential diagnosis-in particular, for children with difficulties in perspective taking, a condition with which children born prematurely could share some characteristics.",

All too frequently persons with more maturity of age than of reason dogmatically state that the cause is A or B, or X or Y, and that its prompt removal will cure all the difficulties in the juvenile approach to life. Some attribute all juvenile misbehavior entirely to mental deficiency, others to disturbances of the thyroid gland, to parental inadequacy, to the diminished authority of religion, or to some other single factor.

      "abstract": "A Consultation on Sexuality was convened by the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Copenhagen in November 1983 to examine the sexual dimensions of health problems. Sexuality influences thoughts feelings actions and interactions and thus physical and mental health. Since health is a fundamental human right so must sexual health also be a basic human right. 3 basic elements of sexual health were identified: 1) a capacity to enjoy and control sexual and reproductive behavior in accordance with social and personal ethics; 2) freedom from fear shame guilt false beliefs and other psychological factors inhibiting sexual response and impairing sexual relationships; and 3) freedom from organic disorders diseases and deficiencies that interfere with sexual and reproductive functions. The purpose of sexual health care should be the enhancement of life and personal relationships not only counseling or care related to procreation and sexually transmitted diseases. Barriers to sexual health include myths and taboos sexual stereotypes and changing social conditions. In addition sexuality is repressed among groups such as the mentally handicapped the physically disabled the elderly and those in institutions whose sexual needs are not acknowledged. Homosexuals are often stigmatized because their sexual expression is at variance with dominant cultural values. Sex education programs and health workers must broaden their traditional approach to sexual health so they can help people to plan and achieve their own goals. Family planning programs must expand from their traditional goal of avoiding unwanted births and help people balance the need for rational planning on the one hand and the satisfaction of irrational sexual desires on the other hand. Promoting sexual health is an integral part of the promotion of health for all.",

An aged, degraded skin is uncomfortable to live in. It is also unattractive and leads to aversive reactions by others. The unhandsome aged have trouble maintaining self-esteem when they recollect the smooth, unmarked, turgid skin that was the clothing of their youth. All this is conducive to a lessening of contact between the aged and potential providers of support, including health care providers.

      "abstract": "When one thrives, they grow, develop and succeed. For people of diverse sexual orientations (DSO) thriving within one's sexuality is often restricted by heteronormativity, minority stress and poor mental health outcomes. Particularly at risk, are DSO \"emerging adults\" aged between 18–29 years who seek stability before transitioning to adulthood. Therefore, this qualitative study interviewed 12 participants between the ages of 18–29 years to investigate perceptions of thriving within one's sexuality and factors that may foster or hinder its occurrence. The results indicated participants perceived thriving as a spectrum of states and processes involving a sense of personal safety with high levels of self-acceptance to believe one could exist freely as a person of DSO. The findings suggested thriving within one's sexuality during emerging adulthood is fostered through the factors of seeking personal growth, social representation/visibility, affirming social support and opportunities to support other DSO people. In contrast, identity denial, unsupportive social environments, erasure/tokenism, and experiences of discrimination eroded one's ability to thrive. Psychological interventions focusing on establishing a strong sense of identity, building a social support network and encouragement to seek thriving opportunities, may foster thriving experiences for Australian DSO emerging adults.",

      "abstract": "Addiction of any kind is indeed detrimental, leading to psychological, financial, and social disorders. However, drug addiction is seen as one of the major concerns worldwide, having the most distressing consequences. This may be attributed to a number of psychosocial factors which put a person at a greater risk to develop such behavior. For some, drugs provide a kind of relief in times of distress, and for others, it increases the confidence level and improves the performance on a given task. Several studies have been carried out so far highlighting various precipitating/perpetuating factors (parental neglect, discord, peer pressure, lack of coping and resilience, and social incompetence) in maintaining such behaviors, as well as the preventive ones (authoritative parenting, extended family system, and enhanced psychological capital) to overcome this menace. What makes it more challenging is holding a fallacious belief of baking (roasting) the weed (Charas) as a skill and smoking as a means of lifting one's morale and a matter of prestige. This may be attributed to the germination of a thought of exhibiting the power of masculinity before the same or the opposite sex and thus eventually sidelines the efforts made by the stakeholders to restrict the ill effects of drug addiction on youth and on society as a whole. There is thus a pressing need to educate young minds and restructure their belief system at a very early stage of development. In that direction, all the institutions (family, school, and place of worship) must go hand in hand to ensure that youth is aware about the ill effects of such illicit behaviors, well in advance.",

The process ending up with suicidal act is shaped by multi-factors, including the socio-cultural ones. Suicide is indeed related to a deep feeling of hopelessness; not to have any control over their lives and circumstances except than deciding to stay alive or dead, and so related to serious psychopathologies, as depressive and substance use disorders. Hence, it is frequently seen as a personal act or as a question of individual decision. But since Durkheim‘s ground breaking work, which still inspires suicide researchers, the cultural factors behind this socially determined phenomenon have been widely discussed. Suicide is totally a personal act and a fully socio-cultural phenomenon. The cultural factors of suicidality are among the social determinants of health/ill health. Epidemiological evidence and cross-cultural comparisons show huge differences in suicide rates across countries and even between regions of same countries, and these are constant differences. Furthermore, even the definition of suicide is effected by the social circumstances. Certain socio-cultural patterns shape how and when people commit suicide; i.e., these patterns have decreasing or increasing effect on suicide rates, which provides basis for suicide prevention. Likewise, social solidarity, high group integration and collective sensitivity may have preventive effects. This brings us to the discussion of the effects of big social turmoil or wars or pandemics on suicidal behavior. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Do supportive personal relationships increase subjective life expectancy? The objective existence of family relationships and the subjective sense of having someone to call on in need may increase the length of life a person expects by creating assurance about the future, by reinforcing healthy habits, and by improving current health. Using the 1995 Aging, Status, and Sense of Control representative sample of 2,037 Americans ages 18-95, we find that having adult children and surviving parents increases the length of life one expects, but young children in the home does not, and marriage only contributes years of life expected for older men. People expect to live longer when they report high levels of emotional support, and the association is mediated entirely by the perception that one has someone to call on when one is sick. People with informal health support expect to live longer than those without it, and this is especially true for persons with physical impairments. Although informal health practices shape subjective life expectancy, they explain little of the effects of supportive relationships. People who smoke, drink heavily, and have poor nutritional habits expect shorter lives, and those who walk and exercise expect longer lives. Better current health is associated with higher subjective life expectancy, but it does not explain the impact of supportive relationships. Most of the impact of supportive relationships appears to be a direct result of projected security about the future. Feeling that you have someone who would care for you if sick appears to increase the sense of security about surviving future health crises, thereby increasing one's perceived inventory of the essential property--life itself.",

      "abstract": "Some important psychosocial factors which lead to unwanted pregnancies -- fear, embarrassment, conflicting priorities, and subconscious motivation -- are reviewed along with the need for nurses to be aware of their own attitudes about contraception and sexuality when counseling clients about contraception. Individuals may hesitate to use effective contraceptive methods because of reported side effects or because they fear the judgmental attitudes of others. Embarrassment about discussing anything related to sexuality or having a medical examination can mean a woman will avoid certain contraceptive methods. Frequently, contraceptive use is subordinated to some other concern, reflecting a lack of maturity, an inability to focus objectively or to plan, to assume responsibility, to accept one's own behavior. Priorities commonly affecting contraceptive use include: the \"nice girls don't\" ideology; \"it won't happen to me;\" \"excitement is taking risks;\" loneliness; and crises and pressures. Although pregnancy may be rejected when it actually happens, it may be desired in part. The desire for pregnancy may be operating at a subconscious level. Additionally, pregnancy may be used to deal with or avoid conflicts in relationships, to ease guilt, or to make up for losses. Nurses counseling clients in family planning clinics can help their clients do a cost/benefit analysis of contraceptive use and pregnancy should it occur. A way to help women explore their available options is group sessions. Nurses should be aware of the goals of family planning work and help each client explore for herself the ramifications of the use of each of the available contraceptive methods.",

For the child, sexuality is a rather general, pleasurable excitation, not a specific genital stimulation. Excessive attention to the perineal area, operation upon or injury to the genital area and injections are vicissitudes which may have an unhealthy influence on later sexual development. Healthy and informed parental attitudes are the key here, just as they are in the normal exhibitionism, curiosity and intense emotional attachments to parents. Parents infect children, healthily or unhealthily, with their attitudes. In healthy growth exhibitionism and peeping become transformed in socially acceptable ways. In unhealthy growth, either perversions or strong reactions like over-modesty or shame result. Masturbation is common and transitory in most children. Parents, and especially pediatricians to whom parents turn, have a golden opportunity to direct healthy growth by being well informed about the infant and child's sexual growth and thus be enabled to advise upon or manage the common developmental phenomena with good commonsense and patience. Infants and children do not enter the world possessing the morals, standards or inhibitions of adults.",

Clinically, practitioners are concerned with whether the difficulty lies in conception or carrying a pregnancy to term; however, in social science research the underlying focus is on the parents' inability to have a child more broadly. Age is a predominant factor in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, such that individuals who are aged 35 years or older are often labeled and treated as infertile within six months, rather than one year, of unprotected intercourse resulting in no pregnancy. Individuals can be characterized as having primary infertility, which is when they have no prior children, or secondary infertility, suggesting they have successfully birthed a child prior to their current attempt to become pregnant. Approximately 15 percent of couples, or 4.3 of the 28 million married couples in the United States, encounter difficulty conceiving at some point in their relational life span.",

Social isolation and loneliness (SI&amp;L), which represent both objective and subjective experiences of social disconnection, have emerged as two key constructs that affect people's health and are particularly relevant to the physical and mental health and longevity of the elderly. The aim of this review is to assess the frequency of SI&amp;L among the elderly, factors related to SI&amp;L, as well as their impact on the quality of life and health of the elderly and the role of nurses/technicians in their healthcare. We performed a search of PubMed database using keywords \"loneliness\", \"social isolation\" and \"elderly\". The prevalence of SI&amp;L among the elderly is from 10% to 28%. Significant factors related to SI&amp;L are female gender, unmarried status, older age, poor income, lower level of education, living alone, low quality of social relationships, poor self-assessment of health and poor functional status. Increased frequencies of dementia, depression, coronary heart disease and stroke have been found among old people with SI&amp;L Health education interventions carried out by nurses/technicians should promote the social inclusion of the elderly.",

Most research has focused on the experience of loneliness in old age, but levels of loneliness are also known to be high among teenagers and young adults. While poor health may be associated with increased feelings of loneliness, there is now considerable evidence on the role of loneliness as a risk factor for poor mental and physical health. Studies show that loneliness is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia and chronic diseases, and also with a higher rate of mortality. Risky health behaviors, a poor cardiovascular profile and compromised immune functioning have all been proposed as potential pathways through which loneliness may affect health.

      "abstract": "The human tendency to impose costs on those who have behaved antisocially towards third parties (third-party punishment) has a formative influence on societies, yet very few studies of the development of this tendency exist. In most studies where young children have punished, participants have imposed costs on puppets, leaving open the question as to whether young children punish in real third-party situations. Here, five-year-olds were given the opportunity to allocate desirable or unpleasant items to antisocial and neutral adults, who were presented as real and shown on video. Neutral individuals were almost always allocated only desirable items. Antisocial individuals were instead usually allocated unpleasant items, as long as participants were told they would give anonymously. Most participants who were instead told they would give in person did not allocate unpleasant items, although a minority did so. This indicates that the children interpreted the situation as real, and that whereas they genuinely desired to punish antisocial adults, they did not usually dare do so in person. Boys punished more frequently than girls. The willingness of preschoolers to spontaneously engage in third-party punishment, occasionally even risking the social costs of antagonizing an anti-social adult, demonstrates a deep-seated early-developing punitive sentiment in humans.",

      "abstract": "Social exclusion and inclusion from groups, as well as the distribution of resources, are fundamental aspects of social life, and serve as sources of conflicts that bear on issues of fairness and equality, beginning in childhood. For the most part, research on social exclusion and allocation of resources has not focused on the issue of group membership. Yet, social exclusion from groups and the denial of resources reflect societal issues pertaining to social inequality and its counterpoint, fair treatment of others. Social inequality occurs when opportunities and resources are distributed unevenly in society, often through group norms about allocation that reflect socially defined categories of persons. This occurs at multiple levels of societal organization, from experiences of exclusion in childhood such as being left out of a play activity, to being denied access to resources as a member of a group. These situations extend to larger level experiences in the adult world concerning social exclusion from voting, for example, or participation in educational institutions. Thus, most decisions regarding social exclusion and the denial of resources involve considerations of group identity and group membership, implicitly or explicitly, which contribute to prejudice and bias, even though this has rarely been investigated in developmental science. Current research illustrating the role of group identity and autonomy regarding decision-making about social exclusion and the denial of resources is reviewed from the Social Reasoning Developmental model, one that integrates social domain theory and developmental social identity theories to investigate how children use moral, conventional, and psychological judgments to evaluate contexts reflecting group identity, group norms, and intergroup dynamics.",

Older adults were biased toward remembering people as being fair, while young adults were biased toward remembering people as being unfair. Holding memory constant, older adults engaged more with people that were familiar (regardless of the nature of the previous interaction), whereas young adults were prone to avoiding others that they remembered as being unfair.

A criminal act can be caused by an unformed drive, frustration, and be learned, including through following others. In the process of determining the motives for criminal behavior, it is not enough to point to direct motives because motivation should be approached as a process, which indicates the possibility of the development of motives over a certain time, and even many years. Thus, it is necessary to take into account socialization, personality traits (the level of aggressiveness, directiveness, and dominance), psychological needs (especially those unmet), and values, which, in a sense of responsibility, often can be considered anti-values.&#x0D; The major crimes against health and life are homicide, fights, and battery. In addition to ordinary murder, the Polish Penal Code lists aggravated murder (e.g., with extraordinary cruelty or as a result of motives deserving special condemnation) and privileged murder (committed under the influence of strong agitation justified by the circumstances), which can also be referred to as murder of passion.

      "abstract": "Paleopathological analyses of skeletal remains have provided significant information about diet and health in prehistoric populations. A number of individuals have been recovered whose remains show evidence of impairments that would have precluded normal functioning, resulting in a disability. The most famous example is Shanidar I; more recent discoveries include the Romito 2 dwarf from Italy and a boy with spina bifida from the Windover site in Florida. These finds have been interpreted by some writers as evidence for compassion and moral decency among the other members of the community, who would have had to support these nonproductive individuals. However, these interpretations are based on a number of implicit assump- tions: about the number of nonproductive members normally present in any population, about the abilities of disabled individuals to contribute to society, about the treatment of disabled individuals by other members of the group, and about the moral rightness of facilitating the survival of a disabled individual under all circumstances. These assumptions are not justified by the evidence from the archeological record or by reference to ethnographic anal- ogy. A tendency to focus on physical traits as the sole measure of productive ability, images of Rousseau's noble savage transported to the past, and unexamined beliefs about the disabled in modern societies have influenced these archeological interpretations. We are not justified in drawing conclu- sions either about the quality of life for disabled individuals in the past or about the motives or attitudes of the rest of the community from skeletal evidence of physical impairment. Archeological reconstructions necessarily involve making assumptions and interpreta- tions of the material data. From the archeo- logical record, which includes artifacts, fea- tures, plant and animal remains, and human skeletaUfossi1 remains, archeologists at- tempt to reconstruct the behavior of the people responsible for the remains. Ethno- graphic analogy plays a major role in this effort by helping the archeologist under- stand the function of particular artifacts and the types of activities that leave particular patterns of remains.

Concomitant with the reintroduction of the ancient European betrothal system, the adolescent age of first coitus has lowered and averages two years earlier than first contraception. The hiatus is attributed to the moral sanctions against open access to contraception in adolescence. The neglect of sexual learning in teenage allows cases of suicidal and homicidal lovesickness to be undetected and likewise the mental template or \"lovemap\" of paraphilic pathology in adolescence lacks both preventive measures and treatment. The newest treatment of the paraphilias is with antiandrogen combined with counseling. Positive or negative preparedness for first orgasm or first coitus correlate with positive or negative outcome in subsequent sexuoerotic health. Knowing the sexology of syndromes, for example genetic and endocrine syndromes of childhood, expedites the delivery of sexological health care service in adolescence.",

Adolescent Cluster A PD was related to the developmental trajectories of residential, career, financial, romantic, and family formation roles during this period, and trajectories were related to a change in symptoms over this period. Symptoms were associated with early parenthood and less advanced education, but for other developmental outcomes tended to differ for men and women.

In addition to its association with depression, suicide is related to panic disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia, more so than other psychological disorders. Therefore, full understanding of the individual, including his or her psychiatric diagnosis, is important in dealing with someone who is suicidal. Suicide is associated with certain traumas. The trauma of physical and sexual abuse as a child increases risk both in childhood and in adulthood. In studying the connection between different types of abuse and suicide, prospective research is needed that uses clear definitions and distinguishes between physical, sexual, and combined abuse. Also, the trauma of contracting AIDS may heighten suicide risk, particularly near the time of HIV testing or if dementia or drug treatment clouds consciousness. At these times clinicians should take special care to assess for suicidality. Suicide is associated with certain groups more than others. Adolescents, the elderly, and certain ethnic groups, such as Caucasians, have higher rates than others. Prevention strategies that acknowledge the uniqueness of the individual and take place at home, in school, and in the community have become extremely important. Suicide may be contagious. Contagion is more likely if the model is a celebrity, if the publicity is extensive, and if people are asked about others rather than themselves. Suicide is so complex that current knowledge, though enabling us to predict which special populations and circumstances increase risk, is not sufficient to predict the specific individuals who will attempt or succeed in killing themselves.",

But societies differ widely in their understandings of childhood as a distinctive stage of the human life cycle. This entry describes anthropological work on childhood as a varying cultural construction, from early comparative studies of childcare and development, through work on the socialization of young children, to more recent 'child-focused' research that takes children's perspectives on their role and position seriously. Anthropological research casts a critical light on institutional attempts to formulate universal understandings of childhood, whether these are found in developmental psychology, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, or the spread of formal schooling as an essential aspect of modern childhoods. Children, through their participation and observation in social worlds, are always understanding more than they are told by adults, often applying cultural concepts or different languages in innovative ways. This frequently leads children to destabilise or reject wider representations of childhood that reflect adult prejudices, or wider fears about the 'disappearance' of childhood or a loss of 'innocence'. Paradoxically, adult attempts to protect children, whether from work or from societal harms, often say more about the politics of representations of childhood, than they do about children's actual experiences.",

      "abstract": "Social support is commonly assumed to protect people from the experience of psychological distress and to enhance well-being. However, past research shows that the effectiveness of social support from family members and friends varies over the life span. Both the stage model of life satisfaction and compensatory processes associated with aging provide accounts for why this may be the case. Accordingly, age was predicted to moderate the association between perceived functional and structural social support and the experience of depressive symptoms and loneliness. Age was also predicted to be associated with lower relationship standards that allow people to remain content regardless of whether available social support decreases. This moderational model was tested in a community-based sample of 325 adults ranging in age from 19 to 85 years. Results indicated that social support from family members and sheer contact with them, as well as social support from a spouse or partner, was most strongly and negatively related to the psychosocial problems in the younger participants. Age also moderated the association between relationship standards and loneliness. Consistent with the assumptions of the stage model of life satisfaction and previous research on compensatory processes associated with aging, older people do not appear to be as dependent as younger people on receiving social support from diverse sources in order to maintain a sense of well-being.",

      "title": "Perceived Parental Acceptance-Rejection, Psychological Adjustment and Self Concepts of Persons with Disabilities",
      "abstract": "Rohner' s Parental Acceptance-Rejection theory (PARTheory) postulates that children all over the world, irrespective of cultural variations, gender, age, and socioeconomic status, need parental love and warmth for healthy social and emotional development. Parental acceptance-rejection is commonly represented along a continuum representing the quality of the affectional bonds between parents and their children and with the physical, verbal, and symbolic behaviors that parents use to express their feeling. One end of this continuum represents warmth dimension whereas the other end is marked by parental rejection exhibited in the form of physically and psychologically hurtful behaviors. Empirical evidence demonstrates that children who do not receive adequate parental love tend to be psychologically maladjusted and exhibit adequate parental love tend to be psychologically maladjusted and exhibit poor self-esteem and self-adequacy and are likely to develop a negative worldview. Rejected children often perceived other individuals as untrustworthy, unfriendly, threatening and even dangerous. All such misconceptions negatively influence their interpersonal relationships and psychological wellbeing. Several researchers have reported that perceived parental love and warmth accounts for about 25% of the variability in psychological adjustment of children (Rohner, Khaleque, & Cournoyer, 2009). Riaz (2010) reported that 20% of the variability in psychological adjustment of children in Pakistan can be accounted for by the extent to which children perceive themselves to be accepted or rejected by their parents. These findings suggest that several other factors (for example, interpersonal, socio cultural, behavioral, genetic) are influencing parent-child relationship and psychological adjustment of children.According to PARTheory the need for positive response or parental acceptance not only persists throughout childhood it exerts a predictable impact on self concept of the individual. The theory predicts the existence of positive correlation between parental acceptance rejection and seven self concepts of children / adults: Hostility/ Aggression, Dependency, Negative Self-Esteem, Negative Self Adequacy, Emotional Unresponsiveness, Emotional Instability and Negative Worldview (Rohner 1986; Rohner, Khaleque, & Cournoyer 2003a). The underlying assumption is that parental behaviors perceived by the child as rejection produce psychological discomfort and development of belief that they are unworthy of parental love. To resolve the dissonance created by children's need to be loved by parents, they adopt negative self concepts.Personality sub theory of PARTheory attempts to predict psychological outcomes of perceived parental warmth and rejection. The mental health of the child is likely to be affected adversely by the severity, frequency and form of his /her experienced rejection. However, some individuals who come from loving families also manifest psychological problems typically displayed by rejected children. All such individuals, according to PARTheory, are categorized as troubled. Nevertheless, a few of them demonstrate emotional stability despite experiencing rejection from parents/caregivers. Social scientists believe that appropriate emotional support and love of parents serves as a key factor in promoting the successful emotional, social and academic development of children. However, in actual practice, the association between perceived acceptance-rejection and psychological consequences is far from perfect. The situation is further complicated for children suffering from certain disabilities.Every child is unique and so is the problem encountered by his/her family. The home environment of children with disabilities and the attitudes of different family members towards disability vary from family to family. It is often a great shock to parents when they come to know that their child is handicapped. While every family struggles to fulfill diverse needs of children, families with disabled children have more challenges. …",

      "title": "Aggression among Chandigarh High School Students: To Know the Prevalence and Level of Aggression in Terms of Gender",
      "abstract": "IntroductionAdolescence is viewed as a period during which biological, cognitive, emotional and social changes and development takes place. Because of reorganization in all of the developmental areas, young children face various behavioral of adjustment problems (1). It is often assumed that this is a difficult period of life, with the adolescents being at risk of high stress, since they have to cope with enormous changes. Some of these changes are in the physical and sexual behavior following puberty, some of the social and financial area, and some relate to decisions about the future .Thus, this period is certainly a period of change in which the adolescents are burdened by various pressures (2).It is very important that adolescents pass through this stage successful otherwise problems may occur that may further lead to the formation of various kinds of deviant behavior like aggression, drug and alcohol use. Erikson (3) further argues that adolescents typically experience diffusion, a strong sense of uncertainty and need to achieve a sense of identity. But at this phase of life they find it hard to do this and are always perturbed about who they are and what their future will be? Such unanswered questions might lead to frustration and aggressive behavior among the adolescents (4,5).Further, biological or hormonal changes in adolescents (increased level of androgen and testosterone) are also associated with behavioral problems like rebelliousness, talking back to adults, and fighting with classmates (6).Thus, emphasizing upon the critical nature of adolescent stage, it is apparent that adolescence and aggression cannot be separated. Many studies tracing the problems of adolescence over several decades have shown an increase in the rate of aggression among the adolescents (7).Aggression is defined as physical or verbal behavior intended to harm. Aggression can either be directed inward by self-mutilation or directed outwardly at another person. Aggressive behavior is often used to claim status, precedents or access to an object or territory (8). According to Eysenck (2), two kinds of aggression are identified namely, person oriented and instrumental aggression. Person oriented aggression is designed to hurt someone else were causing harm in the main goal. In contrast, instrumental aggression has its main goal in obtaining some desired reward with aggression. Another category of aggression is based on the initiator of the aggression.Proactive aggression is aggressive behavior that is initiated by the individual to achieve some desired outcomes whereas reactive aggression in an individual reaction to someone else aggression.These distinctions clearly revealed that aggression is not simple but a complicated aspect .It is not a single idea but it is of various types such as physical or verbal aggression.Physical aggressionAs the word indicates physical aggression is any response that produces or is intended to produce physical injury or physical pain in the victim or damage to an object. It involves the acts of hitting and kicking (9). The large body mass or higher physical development among the early adolescents is also an important predictor of the growing physical aggression among them. This is particularly supported by Trembley (10) who studied the association among the testosterone, physical development, and social behavior during early adolescence. He suggests that adolescents with larger body masses are more likely to be physically aggressive or socially dominant and tend to have higher testosterone levels, when provoked; adolescents tend to show physical aggressive behavior; like they would hit the person who irritates them.Verbal aggressionBurbank (11) reports that children are involved in violence and physical aggression until they have attained the verbal skills but when these are developed, physical aggression is replaced by verbal aggression up to some extent. …",

      "abstract": "Six females and ten males aged eighteen or older had a pediatric histow of reversible growth failure diagnosed as the syndrome of psychosocial or child abuse dwarfism. They were followed in childhood and articipated in a sexological outcome study in young adulthood. Except for one bisexual male, all were rated as elerosexual. In sexuoerotic functioning, the distribution was: 5 normophilic; 5 hypohilic; 1 hyperphilic; 5 paraphilic. Disruption of the parentshild pnirgond in infancy and early childhood by parental deprivation and abuse put the child at risk for long-lasting anomolies of lover-lover pairbonding in adolescence and adulthood. The report is phenomenological and classificatory. It is not etiological, although, insofar as they are developmental, the findings do disclose the possibility of d namic relatedness between events at two or more different phases of the lifespan. On the basis of divergent developmental hrstories some conjectures concerning divergent outcomes are formulated.",

Sexting is commonly understood as the sending and receiving of sexually suggestive or sexually explicit photos, video, or text via cell phone or other technologies. The characteristics that fuel whether one engages in sexting are not well understood. In this study, 459 unmarried, heterosexual undergraduate students (female = 328; male = 131), aged 18 to 25 years, from three universities completed an online questionnaire about their behaviors with technology and romantic relationships. In general, low attachment avoidance and high fear of negative evaluation from the dating partner predicted sending a sexually suggestive photo or video, sending a photo or video in one's underwear or lingerie, and sending a sexually suggestive text. High fear of negative evaluation predicted sending a nude photo or video as well as sending a text message propositioning sex. Low attachment avoidance, greater fear of negative evaluation, and greater social distress when dating were associated with sexting behaviors.",

These emerging adults have personalities marked by high Openness to experience, but lower Agreeableness and social conformity. Nonreligious young adults are typically socially liberal with individualistic, nonauthoritarian values. Their family formation is often delayed, with fewer children and higher rates of singlehood and cohabitation. On one hand, those with low religiousness and infrequent church attendance tend to have more mental health problems and often report familial conflicts if they were raised religiously. However, confidently nonreligious youth in a supportive social context do not substantially differ from religious peers.

Even referring a patient to someone else, when what is in question may be assisted suicide, or euthanasia, seems to involve some complicity. This is a live issue in Canada, but similar dilemmas occur elsewhere. Physicians and others should not be coerced into involvement of any kind in what they regard as wrong. Such coercion goes against the very principles of liberal democracy. Conscience matters. Reasonable accommodation should be given to those whose moral judgment may be at variance with prevailing professional norms. Moral questions should still be given weight within medicine, and disagreements respected.

      "abstract": "Anger and anger rumination are considered to be detrimental to both physical and psychological well being. Furthermore, perfectionism, as a personality construct, seems to be related to various types of maladjustment. Whereas perfectionism has been characterized as being positive when an individual derives pleasure from striving for excellence yet recognizes and accepts individual limitations, it is deemed negative when the individual has unrealistic expectations and is never satisfied with his or her performance. The present study examined whether positive and negative perfectionism was associated with anger and anger rumination. The Farsi version of the Positive and Negative Perfectionism Scale and the Farsi version of the Anger Rumination Scale, as well as Spielberger's State‐Trait Anger Scale were completed by 384 Iranian students. Results showed that anger and anger rumination were, as expected, associated negatively with positive perfectionism and associated positively with negative perfectionism. Positive perfectionism enables individuals to strive for success in a flexible manner and, thus, to experience satisfaction and pleasure rather than dissatisfaction, frustration, and anger. Conversely, negative perfectionism makes individuals vulnerable to emotional distress such as predisposition to experience anger and anger rumination through setting high standards for performance, overgeneralization of perceived failures, negative self‐evaluation, self‐blame, and measuring self‐worth in terms of unachievable goals of accomplishment and productivity. Hence, perfectionism may be regarded as having both adaptive and maladaptive aspects with regard to health.",

      "abstract": "Despite the far reaching role of identity, the Indian Constitution still does not regard the right to identity as a fundamental right or even explicitly guarantee it even though it elaborates on the concept of citizenship. The state does not give the freedom to individuals to choose their identity or the way they would like to be recognized, it’s almost as if the state forces its perceived identity, thereby segregating the society on the basis of religion, sexual preferences, caste, and culture and discriminating against certain sections which it deems unfavorable. \r\nThe debates on identity and human rights have weaved a complicated fabric of entitlements and accountability on the part of citizens and the state. However, this discourse has overlooked a significant aspect of identity in terms of children, who are born out of wed lock, children of single parents, children of sex workers, children born out of rape, orphan, abandoned, destitute children, and children of terrorists and lately children who are born out of commercial surrogacy and in doing so the society upholds the father or the male parent as a superior being relegating or even negating the role of mother in the defining the life and identity of the child. In other words, the state and the society sanction legitimacy only to those children who are born into a typical heterosexual wedlock that is legal under the social, moral and legal norms. Neither the law nor the society accepts that child as a normal human being with his or her own unique identity, for reasons which may be beyond his or her control. \r\nThe reason for denial of the basic human right to identity of such individuals is that the state premised its notion of family as a unit of production on the stereotypes where the male is seen as a provider and a female is seen as a producer, caregiver of the family and one who rears children. It fails to take into account, the shift in the concept of a family with the changing socioeconomic and technological aspects which call for the change in notion of a family as well as examining and redefining the concept of motherhood and fatherhood within these emerging contexts.",

Marriage is a life event where the sacred promises between men and women are delivered. In Indonesia, the condition for a person to get married is if a woman has reached the age of 16 (sixteen) years, while for men 19 (nineteen) years this matter is listed in the law on Marriage. Early marriage is a marriage carried out by a pair of teenagers (men and women) who are still less than 20 years old and are not yet physically, physiologically or psychologically mature. Early marriages that occur are generally carried out by teenage girls. The method used in this research is Qualitative Method of Literature Study. Early marriages that occur in women are caused by several factors, namely cultural factors and customs, parental factors, economic factors, educational factors, and factors from within the individual. Early marriages also have an impact, which is the impact on individuals who do it, the impact on their families and on society or the country",

      "abstract": "It is often claimed that (i) disability is bad for disabled people only when they live in an ableist social environment. However, few believe that (ii) having the physical and mental capacities that typify old age is worse than having the capacities of, say, a typical 30-year-old only because we live in an ageist social environment. This is a problem because it is plausible that (iii) claim (i) is correct if, and only if, claim (ii) is. The three claims form a trilemma. At least one must be rejected, however attractive each may seem. I submit, first, that how we think about disability-related disadvantage constrains the way we should think of old-age-related disadvantages, and vice versa. Second, this constraint forces most of us to revise the way in which we think about either the disadvantages of disability, or old age, or both. Third, ultimately, it is more fruitful to discuss whether the disadvantages specifically connected with disability, or old age, or both, are bad in themselves rather than discussing whether the broad and quite varied set of disadvantages involved in disability and old age, respectively, are bad independently of the nature of the relevant social environment in which they exist.",

      "title": "Child Maltreatment and Eyewitness Memory",
      "abstract": "An important focus in scientific and legal fields is on children's and adults' eyewitness memory and suggestibility about child maltreatment experiences. Eyewitness memory is memory for events (particularly ones of a criminal nature) that people have either experienced as victims or witnessed as bystanders. The term 'child maltreatment' refers to caregivers' mistreatment of children that results in significant harm or potential harm to the children's well-being. Child maltreatment takes the form of acts of commission (e.g. physical abuse, sexual abuse) and/or omission (e.g. neglect). It is legally defined in each country's laws. From a legal perspective, failure to provide accurate eyewitness memory about child maltreatment can have serious consequences, such as wrongful conviction, or acquittal of a guilty perpetrator, both of which can leave child victims unprotected. On average, older children recount maltreatment-related events with greater detail and greater accuracy than younger children. However, various factors (e.g. embarrassment, secrecy) can reverse the age trend. Theories and scientific studies indicate that the relation between child maltreatment and memory depends on the nature of the to-be-remembered event. On the one hand, maltreatment experienced in childhood is associated with particularly accurate memory for stressful, personally relevant information; on the other hand, maltreatment is related to impaired memory for emotionally positive or neutral information. Individual-difference (e.g. trauma symptoms) and contextual (e.g. rapport-building) factors also play important roles. When child maltreatment is investigated by authorities, science-based interview protocols can be used to question children. If child victims are required to testify in criminal court, risk factors for psychological harm include having to testify multiple times and hostile cross examination, but with sufficient emotional support, many children can provide important eyewitness evidence and weather the experience without long-term psychological problems.",

However, alienation is suffered, loneliness is dreaded, ostracism and isolation are borne with resignation or panic, while privacy is sought after. The case for reducing privacy to some other less desired or actually averted condition is apt to be especially compelling in a social order which grounds self-definition in human relationships and interactions. The case for reducing privacy to some other condition has been argued along two lines. First, privacy may be interpreted as a fall from the primal condition of social communion or personal wholeness. Second, privacy may be interpreted as an anonymity which allows a person to escape from his social responsibilities. Again privacy is evil and its pursuit as a good a rationalization. The most striking aspect of the two arguments for depreciating privacy is the fact that they conceal theoretical interpretations of human nature.",

Between the ages of 18 and 24, 179 women had regularly experienced orgasm, but 37 had not. At the age of 25-60, 186 women had experienced orgasm, and 27 had not. We used the method of sampling experiences. The women noted the signs consistent with their usual experiences during “normal” intercourse. It has been established that the appearance of an orgasm before 25 years of age strengthens and reinforces psychological satisfaction, inner comfort, meeting expectations, sexual interest, intensity of reaction and acceptance of what is happening, weakens dysphoria and shame. At the age of over 25 years, appearance of an orgasm maximally stimulates sexual interest, intensity of response, acceptance of what is happening, sharpness of perception, reduces shame and weakens physical discomfort more strongly. The absence of an orgasm before the age of 25 does not have a bright negative effect. After 25 years, this, first of all, leads to a decrease in sexual interest and mood, increased shame, guilt, hopelessness, and disruption of interpersonal interaction.",

      "abstract": "A combination of biological factors such as earlier age at puberty and fecundity, and social factors such as the disappearance of the extended family and of rites of passage and the development of a youth culture have encouraged adolescent sexuality at the same time that length of schooling is increasing and adolescents have not yet become socially autonomous. Adolescents employ contraception relatively infrequently and tend to choose less reliable methods. Reasons for this include ignorance of the biology of reproduction and of contraception methods; the fear of secondary effects, encouraged by the mass media; lack of access to family planning facilities or fear that parents will be informed; and the cost of contraceptives. An adolescent requesting contraception should be treated as a adult, taking into account the degree of maturity; the attitude of the medial practitioner will influence motivation and success in using the method. The medical history will indicate cases in which a hormonal contraceptive is contraindicated. The gynecological examination reveals the gynecological age of the patient, which is more important than chronological age. The frequency of sexual realtions should also be considered in the choice. Because motivation of adolescents is less reliable than that of adults, such methods as rhythm and withdrawal are not appropriate. Condoms or diaphragms are disliked because of the necessity of repeated manipulation before each act of intercourse, but may be acceptable to highly motivated individuals. Condoms are indicated when relations are unexpected and infrequent. IUDs are indicated only when hormonal contraceptives cannot be used and when forgetting of pills is likely to occur. Nevertheless, IUD use in adolescents can entail serious problems of expulsion or of infection that may lead to later infertility. Little is known of the effects of oral contraceptive use on sexual maturation and growth of very young adolescents, but because of the growth inhibiting effects of estrogens, they should not be prescribed earlier than 2 years postmenarche. Low dose pills should be chosen. Sequential pills are preferable for patients with irregular cycles. High doses of steroids administered within 48 hours should be available in cases of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, an IUD may be inserted within 5 days.",

The sad answer is very little, if anything at all. Despite all of this, there is a rapidly growing movement towards so-called divorce which removes the fault or blame con cept from the divorce proceedings and permits a quick and easy dissolution of a marriage, even of many years duration and against the will of one of the parties, on the mere allegation that the mar riage is irretrievably broken. Those who support this approach claim that it will remove the hostility in divorce actions. This view, I submit, is totally unrealis tic. Such hostility is not engendered by the fact that one of the spouses accuses the other of excessive drinking, association with someone of the opposite sex, physical violence or mental crulty. Hostility derives from the fact that one of these conditions does exist in the home; hostility arises because one of the parties does not want a divorce, and yet those who support no-fault divorce propose that the dissolution of marriage be made even easier and quicker or just on demand.",

The Srole anomia scale was used as the dependent variable. Multiple indicators of life chances and social participation were used; health and verbal intelligence were employed as controls. The results showed no relationship between age or other indicators of life chances and anomia, net of education and/or verbal intelligence. Prior studies reporting that age and anomia are causally related probably have done so due to lack of adequate control variables and/or due to cohort effects from the lesser education of the older population in the United States. Compared when employing appropriate controls, aged American males are not more anomic than middle-aged males.",

      "abstract": "Pedophilia is defined as a sexual interest in prepubescent children. It is empirically linked with sexual offending against children: Child pornography offenders and sex offenders with child victims are more likely to be pedophiles based on self-report or objective measures of sexual interests. At the same time, some pedophiles have not had any known sexual contact with children, and perhaps half of sex offenders against children would not meet diagnostic criteria for pedophilia. Pedophilia can be diagnosed using a variety of methods and is an important factor to consider in the assessment of sex offenders because pedophilic offenders are more likely to sexually reoffend and require different interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that pedophilia can be changed. Instead, interventions are designed to increase voluntary control over sexual arousal, reduce sex drive, or teach self-management skills to individuals who are motivated to avoid acting upon their sexual interests.",

      "abstract": "Scientific data do not support a blanket injunction against the use of corporal punishment. The shortand long-term consequences of corporal punishment, or any other disciplinary practice within the normative range, depend for their effects on the cultural and child rearing contexts in which the practice is embedded. Spanking is but one means that can be used by a care giver in a disciplinary encounter, the disciplinary encounter is but one socialization strategy; and socialization is but one dimension of optimal care giving. The disciplinary encounter is intended to control the child's short-term behavior: It should be understood that such encounters do not extinguish children's motivated behavior once and for all, but need to be reinforced periodically. The long-term consequences to the child of nonabusive aversive discipline is mediated by its meaning to the child. The meaning to the child, in turn, depends upon the normative standards of the community and the extent to which the child believes that the parent is generally responsive to his or her desires and needs. A focus on spanking as a major cause of violence is not only scientifically misleading, but also diverts attention from the systemic causes of violence associated with persistent poverty. Spanking, as defined for this conference, is not abusive or violent, although the practice is intentionally aversive. Under most circumstances, spanking a child younger than 18 months or past puberty is counterproductive: the infant lacks sufficient capacity to regulate his/her own behavior or to process the care giver's rationale for spanking, whereas the adolescent (in most cultures, although not all) is likely to reject the care giver's use of physical punishment, which the adolescent views as illegitimate and invasive.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decades, singlehood has become prevalent globally. In India, the same trend has been observed in recent years. Many singles are delaying marriage or choosing never to get married even though marriage is considered important in Indian society. This article explores how singlehood is experienced among Indian singles aged 30 years and older ( N = 153) and their quality of life. Using a mixed-method approach, it was found that a difference exists in the quality of life of the participants based on their gender and living arrangements. Thematic analysis revealed that our participants opt to remain unmarried due to a range of personal and cultural factors. The advantages of staying single include a sense of freedom to explore one’s interests and reduced emotional and financial responsibilities. However, there are notable disadvantages of remaining single for our participants, such as a Lack of intimacy, Apprehension related to health and financial security, Safety issues, and Perceived discrimination in the workplace. We suggest that the findings of this study can be used as a foundation for designing psychological interventions that address the needs of single adults in traditional social contexts.",

As regards terrorists’ psychological characteristics, the available studies (mostly carried out with no sound scientific design) have failed to identify the common or typical pathological personality traits of modern terrorists. The popular opinion that terrorists must be insane or psychopathic is still widespread; however, no evidence exists that terrorist behavior may be caused either by prior or current psychiatric disorders or psychopathy. Not surprisingly, some theories have proposed social factors and non-pathological psychological traits as predisposing elements for terrorist acts, but they generally lack of empirical validation. Moreover, most of these theories do not explain why, even if so many people are exposed to the same social factors or show the same psychological traits, only a tiny minority of them join a terrorist group. Therefore, it is mandatory that systematic and scientific investigations be carried out in order to understand the possible bases for terrorist aggression, including the early detection of possibly associated psychopathology, and to design an appropriate counterterrorism prevention policy.",

The associations of prolonged sedentary behaviour with both physical and mental health are less researched than in adults or children but show a clear pattern of increased mortality, reduced function, frailty, mental health, and longevity. Evidence on interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in older adults is still scarce and studies show only small effect sizes, have short or no follow up beyond the intervention period and are often in combination with efforts to increase physical activity.

They are not. Ethics is concerned with the human person in relation to the good, as a matter of judgement and action (see, for example, Aristotle 2000, esp. Book I). Ethical discourses, as they are repetitively (yet variably) articulated in society, produce the human individual conceptually and socially as a physical and ethical subject. This is done through the construction of stereotypes (which are of course never fully realised by any one individual) and the elision of 'difficult' or 'intermediate' types (through marginalisation, erasure or 'forgetting'). Any ethical subject also has a 'constitutive outside', a set of overt and contrasting categories and stereotypes through which 'others' are understood as different from the ethical subject itself (but without which the ethical subject is not fully intelligible). These may be human others, distinguished by age, sex, race/ethnicity, religion, language, class or any other set of markers, to which an ethical authority or discourse may appeal (see, for example, Aristotle 1996, esp. Books I–III). Or indeed these others may be animals, divinities or spirits (which resemble animals or humans in various ways), or mythological or cult entities of ambiguous status.",

      "abstract": "The strong research interest in the psychology of aging results from the increasing share of the elderly in the social and demographic structure of the modern society.Both loneliness and social isolation are generally seen as problems related to ageing and are considered particularly important determinants of seniors' well-being.Social isolation is an objective indicator of poor social integration.In other words, loneliness may be described as a type of social isolation that is perceived negatively.There is a difference, however, between a state of loneliness (referring to a short-lasting sudden feeling of loneliness) and loneliness as a trait, i. e. a relatively long-lasting experience of loneliness.The level of and the reasons for loneliness, as it is perceived by the elderly and as it drives their behaviour, depend on their age bracket.Loneliness in the old age is associated with reduction in activity connected with inability to work or a lack of mobility, rather than a lack of social contacts.The problem of ageism pertains to a discriminatory attitude towards elderly individuals and their isolation from society.This is an important social and psychological factor that enables the feeling of loneliness.Obviously people in the later periods of ontogenesis have not only to adapt to the new external conditions, but also to react to the changes within themselves.The present paper attempts to define personal subjectness (i.e. agency) as a quality of the senior individual's personality, which includes their ability to adapt not only to constantly changing environment, but also to one's own self.The content of the personal subjectness is also presented through the characteristics of the lowered or increased levels and different types of loneliness.",

A developmental process which leads to suicidal ideation, suicidal communication, self-destructive behaviour, in some cases even to suicide, and its consequences to the survivors is often referred to as a suicidal process. There is no single unanimously accepted definition of suicide, although in most proposed definitions it is considered as a fatal act of self-injury (self-harm) undertaken with more or less conscious self-destructive intent, however vague and ambiguous. Since the deceased cannot testify as to his or her intent, the conclusions about this must be drawn by inference. The evidence required for this inference depends on many factors, for example the mode of death, the use of autopsy, age, gender, social and occupational status, and the social stigma of suicide in the person’s culture. The assessment of suicide intent is always based on a balance of probabilities. This chapter discusses the suicide process and the act of suicide, epidemiology and public health aspects of suicide, basic characteristics of the suicide victim, and finally mental disorders and suicide.",

Using a high-stakes experimental paradigm and an immersive role-playing paradigm, we examined the psychology of experimentally-induced partial innocence on plea decisions. Participants were randomly induced to be either wholly innocent, guilty, or partially innocent of committing an academic transgression and then given the choice to accept or reject a plea deal to avoid disciplinary sanction. Partially innocent participants pled to cheating nearly as often as guilty participants and vastly more often than innocent participants. Partially innocent participants—not unlike guilty participants—experienced greater feelings of guilt than did innocent participants. In turn, these feelings of guilt, but not shame, were associated with taking responsibility for comparable, less severe, and more severe transgressions not committed.",

      "title": "Masturbation—An overview",
      "abstract": "Masturbation is a topic of discussion among all the categories of people since ancient times. Masturbation refers to non-penetrative sexual stimulation of a person’s genitals, often to the point of orgasm. The stimulation can be performed manually, by other types of bodily contact (short of sexual contact), by use of objects or tools, or by some combination of these methods. Masturbatory habits amounting to masturbatory abnormalities are included in the Chapter V (F 65.8) of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems -10 under “Other disorders of sexual preference”. In later 1700, a forged association was made between masturbation and mental illness. Masturbation served for decades as catch all diagnosis for all types of medical complaints of uncertain etiology. During the late 19th century, investigations in psychology and sexology made it clear that masturbation is nearly universal. In Sanskrit, semen is known as ‘DHAT’; and in Susruta Samhita the disorder related to loss of this DHAT has been mentioned as ‘Shukrameha’ and also known as Dhat Syndrome. Kissing, masturbation and intercourse are the frequent sexual activities among adults. Even after a permanent sexual relationship has been established, masturbation remains as a healthy practice during the illness or absence of partner or when intercourse is unsatisfactory. In older age group Involuntary Masturbation may be a manifestation of stroke related Alien Hand Syndrome. Today, masturbatory act is considered as a healthy practice when done in private and an offence if done in the public in most of the countries.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a creature known as homo sosius, humans have an obligation to always live side by side with others. Man will be able to live as well as possible and can mempuyai meaning if he can live together in society. It is inconceivable that humans who live in isolation without intercourse and associate with other human beings. In order to foster a harmony of social relationships or with other humans required a form of self-control in the association of living together called the ethics. Living in the era of globalization while maintaining ethical values is certainly not easy, many challenges and obstacles to be faced. Problems that become challenges and obstacles are increasing violence in society, extinction behavior and attitude in family life and society, decreasing pride of ancestral culture and tradition, increasing of self-destructive behavior such as suicide, alcoholism, drug use, and sex free, decreasing work ethic, low individual responsibility attitude, waning sense of honesty in every human being and many other cases. Seeing the phenomenon that occurs in today's society is more likely to behave with less ethics and morality then study Kakawin Nitisastra is highly recommended, but still many people who do not know the existence Kakawin Nitisastra. Therefore the author examines Kakawin Nitisastra so that later can contribute in the life of society in the era of globalization, in addition to preserving the classic works that many people do not know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problems to be discussed are (1) how is the structure of Kakawin Nitisastra? (2) what are the educational values contained in Kakawin Nitisastra? (3) how is the implementation of educational value in Kakawin Nitisastra in society ?. This study aims to determine (1) the structure in Kakawin Nitisastra (2) the educational values contained in Kakawin Nitisastra (3) the implementation of the educational value contained in Kakawin Nitisastra in the community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theories used to analyze problems are: Structuralism theory from Marsono, Value theory of Tarigan, Behavioral theory of Allport. The subject of this study is the community. Methods of data collection are observation, interview, literature, and documents. The collected data were analyzed by qualitative descriptive analysis method with reduction measures, data presentation, and conclusion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results showed (1) the structure in Kakawin Nitisastra divided into two forms of structure and narrative structure. (2) the educational values contained in Kakawin Nitisastra are the value of religious education, the value of ethical education, and the value of leadership education. (3) the implementation of educational value in Kakawin Nitisastra in society for example to do yadnya, socialize in society well, and become a leader capable of protecting society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

These behaviors are not only maladaptive—they are criminal. But what about other atypical or unusual sexual behaviors that are noncoercive or do not involve children? Certainly, unusual sexual practices find their way into the sex lives of so‐called normal people. For example, normal sexual interactions between consenting adults may include tying one another to the bedpost while making love. Or a man may enjoy sex more when his partner wears lacy panties because he finds it particularly titillating. Are these normal or deviant practices?",

      "abstract": "Feeling lonely motivates people to reconnect with others, but it can also trigger a vicious cycle of cognitions and behaviours that reinforces their loneliness. In this study, we examined the behavioural consequences of loneliness in a virtual social environment. A total of 176 participants navigated a character (protagonist) through a two-dimensional browser game and rated the character's loneliness multiple times during the game. In the first part of the game, another character is introduced as the protagonist's spouse. At one point, the spouse leaves for an undetermined period of time but later returns. Immediately before this separation, higher ascribed loneliness of the protagonist was associated with more frequent interactions with the spouse. After the reunion, however, higher ascribed loneliness was associated with less frequent interactions with the spouse. Ascribed loneliness was not significantly related to the frequency of interactions with others nor to the frequency of solitary activities. These patterns held after controlling for ascribed positive affect. Participants' levels of loneliness were related to the level of ascribed loneliness only when the spouse was present but not when the spouse was absent. In sum, these findings suggest that the conditions that trigger the vicious cycle of loneliness are person- and situation-specific.",

These expectations are dashed however, if their qualifications and work experience, gained in their home countries, are not recognised as legitimate by potential employers and accreditation bodies. This type of social situation is the focus of Relative Deprivation Theory in which relative deprivation is defined as having a perception that an expectation has been dishonoured (the cognitive component) and possessing feelings of injustice, dissatisfaction and discontent at this dishonouring (affective component). Relative Deprivation may take one of two forms. Egoistic Relative Deprivation results when a person feels that he or she has been unjustly deprived relative to other individuals. The result of this is stress and lower life satisfaction. On the other hand, Collective Relative Deprivation, which forms the basis of this article, results when a person feels that his or her group is unjustly deprived relative to other social groups. The result of this is the basis for collective or group actions. Put simply, Relative Deprivation Theory specifies (and empirical evidence has substantiated) that affective relative deprivation is the proximal cause of engagement in protest action, which fully mediates the more distal effects of Cognitive Relative Deprivation.",

We may also adapt our food choices and eating behavior to create a certain impression or to fit in with a particular social group. What we eat depends largely on our desire to conform to social norms and our own or others' stereotypical expectations, which are often an expression of our social identity, that is, the perception of belonging to a group or community. We learn norms and stereotypes by modelling and unconsciously imitating the eating behavior of those around us. Our food choices may also be in line with our personal values, such as health, environmental sustainability, or animal welfare, which are also shaped by our social identity.",

Decisions regarding child custody in divorce cases, child placement in adoption cases, and disposition of cases from juvenile courts have that one semantic connection?best interests of children. All too often, however, these interests are ignored or misconceived, and the noble platitude is reduced to meaningless utterance. Perhaps this happens because of such honored legal maxims as a natural parent has preference over stranger in custody cases. Perhaps it occurs because the individuals most affected by the court decisions, the children, are unrepresented. They seldom have advocates and their fate becomes prize in the struggle between attorneys for opposing spouses or competing would-be guardians. Or perhaps the best interests of children are lost because there is an overemphasis on physical advantages without corresponding concern for the psychological and emotional development of children. A child's tangible require ments?a good school, dwelling, and clothing, are given more weight than psychological needs not easy to define.

      "abstract": "There is widespread recognition that children with specific learning difficulties may experience social and emotional problems because of their learning difficulties, but it is often not realized that impairment of social skills may itself be a form of learning difficulty. This is due to a limitation in the way that the brain is able to understand social conventions. This is called a social cognition (or social learning) deficit. In this chapter, I shall first discuss social cognition deficit, and then discuss a number of behaviour problems that may occur as a result of a specific learning difficulty. Social skills, like any other skills, have to be learned. Yet much of what children learn about socially appropriate behaviour is not actually taught to them; they simply pick it up as they go along. Some children of normal intelligence seem to be less able to learn these things, even when taught. This may be their only area of difficulty, but it is commonly associated with other learning difficulties. These children have been accurately described as being ‘socially tone deaf’. They do not pick up the same cues as other children of the same age. They do not seem to predict the social consequences of their actions. They may be uninhibited, undressing in public without the same embarrassment that their peers would experience. They may be overfriendly to strangers. They may frequently say very tactless things without realizing the effect they are having. They often do not read facial expressions and are oblivious to whether someone is angry or upset with them. They may kiss classmates at an age where this is no longer appropriate. They may make unusual sounds in public. They may be insatiable in their activities, not knowing when to stop in the way another child of their age would. Although such behaviour may be apparent to all who meet the child, the people who are most likely to notice it are the child’s peers. With them, the child often sticks out like a sore thumb. This is something that may not be apparent if the child is only observed in a one-to-one relationship at a clinic.",

For example, in virtually every jurisdiction in the United States, a 14-year-old adolescent cannot legally vote, buy alcohol, or obtain a driver's license. Yet, if that same 14-year-old adolescent were to commit a murder, he or she could, in many states, be tried as an adult—suggesting that the adolescent has the maturity and decision-making capacity consistent with full adult responsibility for criminal behavior. <h3>Adolescent Turmoil</h3> The very notion of an \"adolescent\" as someone different from a child who is, however, not yet an adult in",

For example, it is developmentally normative for adolescents to take greater risks and show greater susceptibility to peer influences than adults.1 These otherwise normal differences can contribute to behaviors that lead to involvement with the juvenile justice system. Beyond developmental influences, additional risk factors associated with youth ending up in the juvenile justice system are cognitive deficits, low school involvement, living in poverty, or being runaway or homeless.2-3",

These observations may be summed up in the general conclusion that the typical delinquent is a socially inadequate as well as irresponsible person.

Risk factors are critical to elder abuse detection, assessment, and prevention. They are most salient in combination and with longer exposure. They also may vary by elder abuse form or setting. Risk factors for which there is substantial supporting research are found in characteristics of the perpetrator (i.e., pathology and dependency), victim (i.e., dementia and problem behaviors), and perpetrator/victim environment (i.e., shared living arrangements, social isolation, or lack of social support). Characteristics of the cultural milieu (e.g., ageism and stereotyping of persons with disabilities) are seen as providing the backdrop for abusive actions.",

But when, and why, is it morally problematic? I argue that in many cases everyday lookism is wrongful because it involves morally objectionable appearance discrimination. I consider various respects in which everyday lookism can be morally objectionable in virtue of the acts of wrongful discrimination it involves. I argue that these acts are wrongful when they are demeaning, or when they have unjust consequences whether singly or cumulatively. There are a number of ways in which they may have unjust consequences. First, the appearance norms in which these acts are rooted may be biased in such a way that the acts contribute to creating an unjust distribution of benefits and burdens. Second, these acts may combine to make everyday lookism oppressive in virtue of impairing the personal autonomy of its victims or contributing to doing so. Third, these acts may be unjustly harmful in terms of their effects.",

      "title": "Loneliness, marriage and cardiovascular health",
      "abstract": "Social relationships, or the lack thereof, constitute a major psychosocial risk factor for health, rivaling the effect of well-established traditional cardiac risk factors. For example, the INTERHEART study, a casecontrol study of patients across 52 countries who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction, reported that adverse psychosocial factors accounted for a population attributable risk of 32.5%, which is similar to the population attributable risk for smoking of 35.7%. Social integration has been defined as the presence of social relationships that provide a sense of belonging, a subjective bond that individuals feel in relation to others and groups of others. A network of positive relationships can provide a tremendous source of support, meaning, and belonging, whereas the absence of relationships or a state of social isolation can have detrimental implications for health trajectories and well-being. Loneliness—the perception that one’s desired social relationships or connectivity are not being fulfilled—has been identified as a significant risk factor for depression and poor health behaviours. Although the prevalence of loneliness can vary with age or life stage, being married or with a partner does not necessarily ensure protection from loneliness. Poor marital quality or dissatisfaction has been associated with higher levels of reported loneliness, new onset depression, and poor long-term survival. The Framingham Offspring Study further documented that repressed marital communication, conflict, and strain were all associated with adverse health outcomes, especially in women. These data strongly suggest that psychosocial factors such as loneliness and marital quality, a component of social integration, exert considerable influence on the biopsychosocial experience of recovery and resulting health outcomes. In this issue of the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, Roijers et al. present the results of a prospective cohort study for patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention who underwent cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for three months and were followed up for 12 months. These Dutch patients were representative of a typical population referred for CR. The population was analyzed for changes in subjective health status as determined by a Dutch normed SF-12. Of the many psychosocial variables that might influence health status, ‘‘loneliness’’ and ‘‘marital health quality’’ were chosen for analysis using standardized measures. They found that the ‘‘optimal married’’ versus ‘‘less optimal married’’ had similar improvements in a relative sense, even though the ‘‘less optimal married’’ started at a lower baseline value. After 12 months, the ‘‘optimal married’’ achieved and even surpassed the Dutch median population norm, whereas the ‘‘less optimal married’’, although showing improvement, did not reach this level. ‘‘Lonely’’ and ‘‘non-lonely’’ patients improved in a similar relative sense, but again the ‘‘lonely’’ patient group started at a lower level and did not reach the mean Dutch values for health perception. So, what are we to make of these intriguing findings? Interestingly, the improvements in the mental and physical perceived health status continued to improve after the end of the CR program until the 12-month followup. Further study could focus on the participants during the 3–12 month timeframe to specifically assess the reasons for this. For the ‘‘marital quality’’ groups, the cardiac event may have been the outside threat that galvanized improvement, or such couples may have received extra psychological counseling during and/or after the CR program. In a similar fashion, the ‘‘lonely’’ and ‘‘non-lonely’’ groups increased both during the CR program and afterwards. Although",

Lack of appropriate chores, decreased opportunities to interact and compete with peers, plus uncertainties to interact and compete with peers, plus uncertainties about bowel and bladder continence appear to be the greatest impediments to emotional growth in this physically handicapped group of teenagers.

It is surprising, therefore, that the seeking of body contact has received so little attention in the psychiatric literature.

Some observations on human infants and adults have been reported but mostly as incidental findings, and they are not derived from systematic studies.

      "abstract": "The family is the priority of any state that is interested in preserving its people, strengthening its international status and all socio-cultural institutions. Family and marriage themes within the framework of the humanities are explained not only by the expansion of the problems and objects of these sciences, but also by the need to strengthen the family as the foundation of society. Without the support of the family, many social problems cannot be resolved: the upbringing of the future generation, the transmission of life values, the fight against crime, despotism, mental illness. Domestic violence is a serious social problem that poses a direct threat to life for every person and society [7]. Violence in general, and family violence in particular, is not only an attempt on life and health, but also a violation of the constitutional right of a person to protect his dignity. This problem is the object of scientific research in sociology, psychology, jurisprudence and other disciplines. Observations have shown a decline in the prestige of family values, an increase in the number of divorces, a decrease in the birth rate, an increase in the number of dysfunctional and so-called problem families, etc. The article provides a psychological classification of families that differ in their characteristics and family relationships. The results of a survey conducted among specialists working with families are analyzed, with the help of which the consequences of negative attitudes, domestic violence are revealed and indicators of various types of violence are compiled. This article reveals not only the types of violence, but also the factors affecting family relationships. The results of the study carried out among members of young families and the psychological analysis of the results obtained are presented. The necessary recommendations for the prevention of domestic violence and measures to strengthen the family were given.",

      "abstract": "Discussions of sexual misconduct often focus primarily or exclusively on the parties directly involved in sexual behavior. As a result, the discussion generally centers on consent. While consent is critically important, this Article instead focuses on harms to third parties resulting from sexual behavior—regardless of whether that behavior is consensual. Doing so reveals a dynamic that the conversation about sexual misconduct has not yet fully acknowledged: the presence or absence of consent between participants does not determine whether third parties suffer harm. Sexual behavior does not occur in a vacuum. Rather, it occurs in a particular context and often has significant consequences for other individuals beyond the participants in the behavior.Sexual behavior is problematic when it involves what this Article will refer to as an institutional power disparity: that is, one participant has power over the other as a result of their institutional roles. Institutional power disparities are inherent, for example, in sexual behavior involving a supervisor and their subordinate or a professor and their student.Such behavior risks significant harm to third parties within the institution. Third parties may be injured as a result of sexual favoritism. For example, a worker may be passed over for a promotion in favor of a less qualified worker who is having sex with the boss. Or third parties may suffer harm from a sexualized institutional environment. For example, students may avoid professors who are known for pursuing sexual relationships with students or may find it alienating to be viewed as a professor’s prospective sexual partner. And the institution itself may suffer harm when sexual behavior involving an institutional power disparity interferes with worker productivity and morale, or with student learning and intellectual growth.Harm to third parties justifies regulation of sexual relationships in the context of an institutional power disparity. In some circumstances, such relationships should be prohibited so long as the institutional power disparity remains. In other circumstances, careful regulation can mitigate potential harms to third parties and to the institution itself.",

These stressors may be caused by two sources of threat, firstly, the loss of bonding with the caregiver and later with a partner and/or group which relates to the SEPARATION (PANIC/GRIEF) system, secondly, social defeat as an expression of the social competition and social dominance. The sexual maturity drives the individual to social competition and social dominance, even if the latter often occurs before sexual maturity, e.g., chickens, dogs, non-human primates, and humans. Depression is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in mammals to terminate both separation anxiety, so as to protect the vulnerable social brain from the consequences of prolonged separation anxiety, and the stress of social competition when social defeat is predictable. Adolescence and Young adulthood are particularly susceptible to these two types of threat because of human developmental characteristics that are summarized by the term neoteny. This refers to the slowing down of growth and development, resulting in both a prolonged period of dependence on a caring/protective adult and the persistence of juvenile characteristics throughout life. Therefore, neoteny makes the transition from childhood to sexual maturity more dramatic, making the integration of the SEPARATION (PANIC/GRIEF) system with the dynamics of social competition and dominance more stressful and a source of depression. Stress is an expression of the HPA-Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis that articulates with other systems, mainly the autonomic nervous system and the immune-inflammatory system. The latter is believed to be one of the most significant components in the dynamics of depressive processes, connected to the prodromes of its activation in childhood, under the pressure of environmental and relational stressors which can lead to learned helplessness. The recurrence of stressors makes it easier for the immune-inflammatory system to be activated in later life, which could make a significant contribution to the establishment of a depressive disease. The possible contribution of children's identification processes with their parents' depressive personalities through observational learning is considered.",

According to the theory of life-course-persistent antisocial behavior, children's neuropsychological problems interact cumulatively with their criminogenic environments across development, culminating m a pathological personality. According to the theory of adolescence-limited antisocial behavior, a contemporary maturity gap encourages teens to mimic antisocial behavior in ways that are normative and adjustive. There are marked individual differences in the stability of antisocial behavior. The chapter reviews the mysterious relationship between age and antisocial behavior. Some youths who refrain from antisocial behavior may, for some reason, not sense the maturity gap and therefore lack the hypothesized motivation for experimenting with crime.",

The common denominators underlying these various systems consist of unrealistic beliefs that set off and maintain unrealistic fears that heterosexual functioning and graficiation will be hurtful to self. Distortions of beliefs and convictions about sexuality are established in childhood as a consequence of adverse influences on sexual development. Destructive attitudes are usually exerted by parents but also by other power figures in and outside the family. The most common sexual disorders seen in the general population are dysfunctions such as impotence, premature ejaculation, frigidity, and other operational problems; however, psychological difficulties linked to sexual behavior, though not usually recognized as sexual, are far more common— falling in love, maintaining long-term love relationships, resistance to marriage, and postpartum reactions.",

There is a strong desire for presenting a desirable image of themselves to other people, accompanied by considerable uncertainty that it can be done. Harmonious and deep relationships with family members, friends and romantic partners are very important for every person, but for socially anxious people they are a source of stress. A number of studies have shown that social anxiety disrupts interpersonal relationships. On the one hand, socially anxious, like most people, want social acceptance and intimacy and they have a desire to achieve satisfying relationships with other people. But, on the other hand, their beliefs and strategies prevent them from participating in social encounters and the disaffiliation makes them lonely and depressed. Their inhibitory and avoiding behaviors have negative consequences for developing and maintaining close relationships. Socially anxious people have strong conflict between need for affiliation and need for avoidance other people. Studies have also shown that although socially anxious people are characterized by an avoidant style of interaction there is evidence that they also develop a dependent interpersonal style.",

The impact of parental loss during childhood is life-long. Its myriad manifestations can be broadly grouped under the following categories: continued intrapsychic relationship with the dead parent, mental pain and defenses against it, narcissistic imbalance, disturbances in the development of aggressive drive, problems in the realm of love and sexuality, disturbances in the subjective experience of time, and attitudes towards one's own mortality. To be sure, a provision is important in the treatment of all patients but it acquires greater valence in those with a background of childhood parental loss. While they might not have consciously experienced or registered it as such during childhood, adults orphaned as children remain forever vulnerable to separation anxiety, or to use Fred Pine's more evocative term, 'separateness anxiety'; this involves discomfort and disorientation over the sense of separateness from others.",

      "title": "Dealing with mature employees",
      "abstract": "During the 20th Century much of the research and writing about the design of organizations and the behavior of individuals at work was based on some implicit, but commonly shared assumptions about the demographic characteristics of the work force. For example, until the late 20th Century it was common, and not incorrect, to assume that there were more men than women employees in some occupations, e.g. lawyers, doctors or constructions workers and the other way around in other occupations such as teaching or nursing. By the same token it was safe to assume that there were fewer older employees than younger ones, i.e., that the workforce in most organizations could be depicted by an age pyramid with few older employees at the top and many younger ones towards the bottom. The age of the oldest employees in most organizations could be predicted to be between sixty and sixty-five with few exceptions. By the same token it was safe to entertain some implicit assumptions about the way work was carried out. For example, for most of the 20th Century it was safe to assume that the older employees had more seniority and could be allowed more independence and less human supervision carrying out routine assignments. It was also common to assume that most workers left home for the work place in order to carry out their duties or that they knew most of their co-workers. Toward the end of the 20th Century many of the implicit assumptions about the workforce and work, such as those listed above, were not true any more. In America, for example, new legislation and court challenges of employment prac-",

      "abstract": "Amidst well-trumpeted calls for a ‘step change’ in the quality and range of UK social work andsocial care research to improve the evidence base for policy and practice, have come contrastingclaims for interdisciplinarity on the one hand and disciplinarity on the other. For some,disciplinarity has little purchase: academically we live in a ‘post disciplinary era’, andprofessionally the boundaries between social work, social care and related human services areincreasingly diffuse. According to this argument, ‘transgression’ - in the literal sense of ‘movingacross or beyond’ disciplinary boundaries - is the prerequisite for high quality, high impactresearch in the field. For others, disciplinary (along with professional) identities and integrity areheld more dear. Discarding or diluting them amounts to ‘transgression’ in the idiomatic sense -an ‘act of wrongdoing or sin’. Few who hold to this view doubt that the intellectual and researchcontributions of many disciplines can and should combine to grow the best possible evidencebase for social work and social care. But distinct disciplines bring with them their own historiesand culture, their own distinctive priorities and approaches to understanding the worlds theyinform. Without strong disciplines, the argument goes, and in particular without a strong socialwork discipline, claims for interdisciplinarity amount to rhetoric at best, intellectual colonisationat worst.This discussion draws on the research of the Strategic Adviser to the UK Economic and SocialResearch Council (2008-10), commissioned to develop recommendations for building academicresearch capacity in social work and social care. The paper examines how the challenges ofresearch capacity development throw into sharp relief political, intellectual and professionaltensions around disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, calling into question both the vices and thevirtues of ‘transgression’. It explores how these tensions are embedded in the distinctionbetween social work and social care research. The former is a recognised but emergentdiscipline, with distinctive focus on practice and ‘pockets of research excellence’, but in need ofimprovement in its social science research base, engagement with context, investment andcritical mass. Social care is not a recognised discipline, but a research field (broadly equivalent tohuman services research elsewhere) to which a wide range of well established cognatedisciplines might contribute their insights and rigour, with the potential to complement but alsoto occlude the focus on practice. Unpacking some of the distinct and different models ofinterdisciplinarity that might be brought to bear, this paper looks critically at the opportunitiesand threats that they present. In doing so, it suggests how research capacity development insocial work and social care might best build on the virtues, not the vices, of transgression.",

      "abstract": "In ancient Greece and in the countries of the East paedophile activities were, generally, not prosecuted; they were considered to be normal sexual practices. The Church saw this issue differently and, from the very beginning, condemned paedophilia. The earliest Church documents bear witness to that: Didache (ca 100), St. Justin condemns it in his Apologia (ca 153), Synod of Elwira (305-306), Apostolic Constitutions (ca 380), Gratian’s Decretum (ca 1140), the third Lateran Council (1179), the fourth Lateran Council (1215), the Code of Canon Law of 1917, and the Code of Canon Law of 1983. Paedophilia is a sexual deviation when an adult experiences sexual gratification only in relations with children that have not yet developed secondary and tertiary sexual features. According to the International Classifications of Diseases ICD-10, and according to the classification of the American Psychological Association DSM-IV, paedophilia belongs to the disturbances of sexual preferences. Paedophilia may take various forms: with or without the physical contact, with or without the use of force, it can also take the form of child’s pornography. According to can. 1395,2 of the Code of Canon Law the following are the distinctive elements that make up the crime of paedophilia: a) the age of the victim (below the age of eighteen) b) t he sexual nature of the offense against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue; c) the perpetrator must be a cleric. The Church’s Modus Procedendi stipulates that in cases of the molesting of minors, in the light of the Code of Canon Law of 1983 and of the EPISTULA a Congregatione pro Doctrina Fidei missa ad totius Catholicae Ecclesiae Episcopos aliosque Ordinarios et Hierarchas interesse habentes: DE DELICTIS GRAVIORIBUS eidem Congregationi pro Doctrina Fidei reservatis of 18th May 2001, the ecclesiastic superior must be notified of the likelihood of an offense having been committed. He conducts the preliminary investigation of which he, then, notifies the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, having studied the findings of the preliminary investigation conducted by the ecclesiastic superior, issues him with an instruction as to the further proceedings. In the Church, the prosecution in cases of the molesting of minors terminates when ten years have lapsed since the victim came of age.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Relatively subtle forms of exploitation of human subjects may arise from the inefficiency or incompetence of a researcher, from the existence of a power imbalance between principal and subject, or from the uneven distribution of research risks among various segments of the population. A powerful and knowledgeable person (or institution) may perpetrate the exploitation of an unempowered and ignorant individual even without intending to. There is an ethical burden on the former to protect the interests of the vulnerable. Excessive or insufficient compensation may be exploitative. However, genuine economic imperatives motivating needy volunteers have to be considered. These forms of exploitation should be appreciated in the context of social and cultural factors suggesting that the relationship between researcher and subject cannot properly be appraised as a contractual undertaking. While compliance with pertinent codes and regulations minimises the exploitative potential, they cannot be enforced in a way that does not recognise a society's peculiar characteristics. The experience with some Filipino cultural traits illustrates this point.",

Questions may be clarified, distinctions drawn, arguments examined, and solutions found without appealing to theoretical considerations about the nature and justification of basic moral principles. Thus, the fact that two people have different foundations for their ethical views is sometimes irrelevant to the resolution of a particular problem. Suppose, for example, a question arises over whether everything possible should be done to prolong the life of an elderly man in a nursing home. Suppose, too, that he has no known family and that the decision must be made by the staff. One person, A, might argue that the man should be treated because not to do so would be to violate the duty to preserve and prolong life. Another person, B, might also argue that the man should be treated, but for different reasons.",

Studies suggest that a good number of gifted students begin to struggle with these conflicts during early adolescence and that these conflicts are a contributing factor to academic underachievement, risk avoidance, and a long‐term reduction in aspirations and overall achievement. The essence of keeping motivation and achievement high among gifted young adults is not so much avoiding these conflicts, but developing the attitudes and skills needed to manage them as they arise. Interventions and supports should be aimed at anticipating and normalizing such conflicts as well as at direct instruction of specific coping strategies.",

La prima e più importante è indubbiamente etica. L'orientamento sessuale, l'identità di genere e le caratteristiche sessuali sono parte integrante della nostra identità. Garantire che le persone LGBTI non siano condannate a nascondersi o a subire offese quando la loro identità viene rivelata, è fondamentale per consentir loro di vivere in armonia con la propria identità, senza fingere. La seconda ragione è economica. La discriminazione nei confronti delle persone LGBTI ostacola lo sviluppo economico attraverso un'ampia serie di canali. Ad esempio, determina un minore investimento nel capitale umano a causa del fenomeno del bullismo a danno delle persone LGBTI a scuola, nonché una minore redditività degli investimenti nel settore dell'istruzione sul mercato del lavoro. La discriminazione nei confronti delle persone LGBTI contribuisce anche a ridurre il livello di performance economica, escludendo i talenti delle persone LGBTI dal mercato del lavoro, danneggiando la loro salute mentale e fisica e quindi compromettendone la produttività. La terza ragione per la quale l'inclusione delle persone LGBTI dovrebbe costituire una priorità essenziale delle politiche pubbliche è di carattere sociale. L'inclusione delle persone LGBTI favorisce la creazione di norme di genere meno restrittive che contribuiscono al progresso della parità di genere in senso lato.",

There is a lack of clarity surrounding frailty as it lacks a universal common definition, multiple factors are attributed to frailty and no definitive assessment tool is available.

This review discusses the important role that social and environmental factors play in predicting the risk of frailty in older adults, as well as discussing the various signs of frailty.

The care and education of minors was ordinarily entrusted to parents, but death, incapacity, licentious conduct, poverty or abandonment often resulted in the minor being removed from parents and taken by others into custody of guardians or institutions of public welfare. The majority of the analyzed lawsuits resulted from an attempt by parents to recover their authority over their children. The lawsuits indicate that the racial, gender, social, and generational “disadvantages” of plaintiffs did not a priori determine the judgement, but rather that arguments for family stability frequently were decisive when heard by sympathetic judges. Disadvantages persons thus frequently argued sucessfully about the meaning of the family, as protagonists in the legal system that otherwise often marginalized them.",

The contexts in which the medical and lifestyle factors associated with involuntary childlessness occur, and overcoming these barriers, are explored from within the wider sociocultural, family, and work environments. The evidence presented shows that, with increasing use of technology and innovation to assist individuals to achieve the goal of parenthood, accurate record keeping, monitoring, and human rights need to be at the forefront of these interventions, and allow the resultant children their basic human right to accurate birth and genetic information. The experience of involuntary childlessness and treatment success and/or failures therefore straddle psychological, behavioral, sociocultural, physical, and medical domains, which should be weighted proportionally in research, policy, and practice.",

Available research literature on the responses of married persons to divorce is reexamined in terms of an alternative query: under what conditions is divorce, a potentially traumatic experience, actually experienced as a stren, a personality enhancing or growth experience? Seventeen factors contributing to this outcome are discussed: the definition of divorce as a normal event; the personalities of the participants, including the ability to define experiences as strens; age and sex; marital life style; the quality and length of marriage; the length of termination of the marriage; the status of 100initiator or noninitiator; attachment and the ex-mate; income and education options; traditional or nontraditional gender roles; supportive networks; geographical mobility; the presence of peer support groups; and the role of a significant other.

      "title": "‘Am I sexually abused?’ Consent in a coach-athlete lesbian relationship",
      "abstract": "Elite-athlete Karin was 17 years old when the considerably older team coach Selma became her girlfriend. Responding to calls to prevent harm and sexual abuse in sport, this study represents Karin's story, investigates how she makes sense of her coach–athlete sexual relationship, and analyses what can be learnt about consent. Although sexual consent is often the defining criterion of sexual abuse, consent is rarely explicitly defined or its social implications examined. Moreover, there are no studies on coach–athlete lesbian or gay relationships despite sexual minority vulnerability. The interview with Karin was analysed using narrative case study methods; represented as a short story and discussed in reference to sexual consent theory. The analysis outlines contextual factors conditioning the negotiation of consent and problematises heteronormative, gendered perpetrator and victim stereotypes. Secrecy, alienation and isolation is recognised, extending into additional vulnerability inflicted on socially problematic and atypical coach–athlete relationships. In conclusion, social implications of consent are more complex than yes/no to sex or inherent incapability to consent. Consent is multi-layered, alternately absent and present; an ongoing process that includes compromises, contradictions and (re)negotiations influenced by structure and agency. Further research examining a diversity of sexual experiences among majorities and minorities is proposed.",

Si bien el abuso sexual es una cuestion de salud fisica y mental para un individuo con muchas y variadas consecuencias, tambien se enfrenta a los aspectos de los primeros vinculos, los vinculos de apego, ya que suele tener lugar dentro del circulo familiar. A la luz de tres vinetas clinicas, el articulo discute el concepto de destructividad, tanto de forma general como especifica, en situaciones de abuso sexual, para proponer, finalmente, algunos puntos de atencion en torno al habla del nino durante el cuidado. Cabe senalar que el nino, independientemente de que hable o no, a menudo sigue estando psicotraumatizado. La destructividad se refiere a la naturaleza destructiva de un elemento vivo o no vivo y, mas generalmente, a la capacidad de destruir. En relacion con este concepto, podemos observar, en general, los llamados factores de gravedad y otros llamados factores de proteccion que pueden coexistir. Si los primeros son mas graves, hay una alta probabilidad de que los sintomas sean incapacitantes y duraderos, observando que pueden empeorar con el tiempo o aparecer de forma retardada. Si los factores de proteccion son significativos, entonces es mas probable que el nino experimente un trauma leve y una curacion mas o menos rapida.",

      "title": "The tightrope of desire: A qualitative study of sexual conflict in single heterosexual Orthodox Jewish men.",
      "abstract": "How do adults experience and manage their sexual desires, when these desires are laden with shame, guilt or religious transgression? This study looked at a group of 15 heterosexual, single adult men in the Orthodox Jewish community whose religious laws explicitly prohibit them from both masturbating and from expressing all forms of premarital physical intimacy. When these religious laws are internalized, the person can encounter a unique set of conflicts that can significantly impact his relationships, religiosity, and emotional well-being. Interviews focused on the different ways that men navigated these conflicts over the course of development. Findings point to 3 distinct conflict/defense positions that represent advancing developmental stages on the road to “sexual ownership”: (1) sexual disembodiment, during which the person’s desires are felt as irrational and senseless outside forces, split off from their otherwise purpose-driven self; (2) sexual internalization, where desire is felt as an anxiety-laden but tolerable part of the self, and the person manages his intrapsychic conflicts using a variety of mature defense; and (3) sexual integration, where the person accepts their sexual desire as an important part of the self that can be linked to other motives, needs, and conflicts. The factors that facilitate and obstruct the sexual ownership process are discussed. The generalizability of this process to other populations is considered, and clinical recommendations are provided for therapists who encounter sexual ownership problems in their patients.

      "title": "Disappointment : When Things Turn Out Wrong or Worse Than Wanted",
      "abstract": "This chapter explores the relatively neglected emotion of disappointment. Despite the fact that feelings of disappointment are undoubtedly widespread, the interest in the study of disappointment so far – at least within sociology and related disciplines – has been rather disappointing. Disappointment, as this chapter shows, is an important emotion in human and social life, not least because it is so recognizable to most of us due to our own experiences with it. Disappointment is closely connected to past experiences and our expectations for the future, and it arises when reality somehow turns wrong or worse than what we wanted or expected. The experience of disappointment can be related to a variety of different areas of life such as education, career, love life, one’s relations to self, to others or to life in general. Disappointments can be minor or major, but they need to be managed and processed in order for us to learn from them or leave them behind. Disappointment is not only an individual experience but also a cultural and collective thing that may characterize the feelings of groups or entire populations. In this way, collective experiences of disappointment may serve as an important trigger for calls for social change or event revolt. This chapter provides an overview – however far from exhaustive – of how we may initially understand disappointment from a primarily sociological and subsidiarily from related perspective as a platform for further investigation.",

However some people get trapped in unique ways of relating to others that end up in conflict and suffering. You may have heard the word codependent if you know someone who has had a drug or alcohol problem. People who are codependent become absorbed in the problems of the person with an addiction and ignore a lot of their own needs, living instead mainly in reaction to the behaviours of the other person. However codependency-like behaviour is not restricted to people in relationships with someone with substance dependency. In fact, contrary to what some people say, codependency is not a disease and not a clinical term. Nevertheless it is helpful to think in terms of codependency to help people work through dysfunctional relationships and improve quality of life.",

      "title": "Optimism and Its Associations with Health Behavior and Responses to Health Communication",
      "abstract": "When individuals are asked whether they will someday own their own home, enjoy a productive career, or develop a myriad of diseases, many are optimistic. Generally, they think they will experience more good than bad outcomes in life and they view themselves as more likely than similar others to experience the good things and less likely than others to experience the bad things. In the area of health behavior and communication, there are three primary types of optimism that have been defined and operationalized: (1) Dispositional optimism is the generalized positive expectancy that one will experience good outcomes. (2) Comparative optimism refers to the belief that one is either more likely than others to experience positive events or less likely than others to experience negative events. (3) Unrealistic optimism refers to an underestimation of one’s actual risk of experiencing some negative event. Although the three types of optimism may be correlated, their associations may be modest. Also, unlike dispositional optimism, which is an individual difference, comparative and unrealistic optimism are often risk perceptions about specific events and therefore can be defined as accurate or inaccurate. For this reason, the latter two types of optimism have sometimes been labeled the <italic>optimistic bias</italic>. Research on all three varieties of optimism affords opportunities to understand how optimism influences information processing in a health message or one’s behavioral intentions following the message.",

      "title": "A Review on Paraphilias",
      "abstract": "Sexual deviations are disorders in which the individual has fantasies, sexual desires or behaviors that are repetitive and sexually provocative and often include inhumane issues for at least 6 months. Since these people   usually make various legal problems for both themselves and others, this disorder is of special interest. Different models have discussed on the etiology of sexual deviations among of which the special psychoanalysis of Freud have investigated this disorder more comprehensively. In Freudian’s psychoanalysis, sexual deviation has a neurosis structure and shows that sexual deviated has in fact accepted the deprivation of the mother,  but is still trying to return to the bosom of the mother and the denying father. Also, in self-psychology the sexual deviant who has had wrong repeating scenarios in regards to his/hers relationship with parents or as a sadistic seeks to create a temporary and false glorious sense of confidence, to create  a   grandiose self who is self- sufficient and does not need anyone. In many cases body organ justifications are also considered for sexual deviations. Among the examined patients in psychiatric clinics, 74% had hormone level disorders,  27% had neurologic symptoms, 24%, had chromosomal disorders, 9%  had epilepsy, 4% had abnormal EEG, 4% had major psychiatric disorders  , and 4% had mental retardation .Some sources propose 9 identifications for sexual deviation which include: Fetishism, Pedophilia, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Sexual Masochism, Sexual Sadism, Transvestic fetishism, Frotteurism and Paraphilias. The treatment of sexual deviations has great complexity due to its coincidnce with psychiatric disorders such as personality disorders, as well as other factors such as the patients’ shame and modesty and not stating their problems. The treatment of sexual deviation is considered to have four general purposes including a) reducing sexual desires b) giving insight and understanding to the patient c) controlling external stimuli d) treating concurrent disorders.The treatment of sexual deviation involves extensive ranges of biological therapies to mental therapies.  One of the major approaches to psychotherapy in the treatment of sexual deviations is the insight oriented approach that causes a person to improve his interpersonal skills and to find an acceptable method for sexual gratification. Treatment in groups through specific procedures and guidelines and practices can also help the patients. When a person has other psychiatric disorders, pharmacotherapy can treat concurrent biological problems of the individual as well as reducing sexual and obsessive desires. In rare cases where the problem is very serious or causes legal conflicts, surgical treatment is recommended. Keywords: Review, Paraphilias,  Transvestic, Justice, Frotteurism",

Adequate coexistence of hunger and satiety brings health and wellbeing and inadequacy in food intake can threaten the health and survival. Eating behavior is a complex phenomenon compounded by interplay of central nervous system, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems linked with numerous neural pathways [1]. To put anything in mouth is a discernible human behavior and governed by hunger, hormones, emotions, and desires. Numerous life events may claw the normal eating behavior leading to aberrant eating pattern, if prolonged can result in Eating Disorders (ED). Anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating are common eating disorders which affects millions of people of all ages, men, women particularly teenage girls. Major causes of ED were associated with physical and emotional destructions due to psychological and socio-cultural factors. New researches are indicating its link with genetic and neurochemical pursuits. In most cases of anorexia, the victims have high self-image and want to protect oneself from body shaming. ED victims are often entrapped in fancy images of their bodies in social and media circles and are either unaware or refuse to accept their problem and its adverse consequences. ED is a manifestation of anxiety and trauma of self-image stirring to the extent of hospitalization and fatal stage.",

It could be demanding in either of two ways: by answering too many practical questions, leaving too few to be resolved on non‐moral grounds, or by thwarting too many of our natural, non‐moral desires. The former is irrelevant to making/allowing but the ‘thwarting’ kind of demandingness is not, and attempts by Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick to fend off the threat are failures. The ‘thwarting’ threat might be countered by adopting a morality that requires or permits more attention to one's own interests than to others’, but when that is combined with the moral neutrality of making/allowing, the result is requirement or permission for behaviour that no decent person would agree to.",

At its most basic, it is the view which others have of us – the (good) esteem in which we are held or standing we enjoy in the general community. No two reputations are the same, but they all depend in this way on community judgments. Most often these judgements are moral, but they can also be based on attitudes or criteria which have no obvious, ethical dimension. A corporation‘s reputation is hence commonly shaped by the market‘s economic appraisal of its creditworthiness or performance, and individual reputations can be affected (questionably, one might think) by widely-shared social attitudes towards a person‘s heredity, health, colour, appearance or sexuality – all matters which lie beyond their control. A reputation therefore comprises not just a person‘s moral standing in a community, but 'all aspects' of that person‘s standing – moral, economic and social.",

Some recovered memories, both actual and false, can lead to trauma symptoms. Heated debate over the validity of recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse and satanic ritual abuse led to the so‐called “Memory Wars.” It is well established that one can use hypnosis and other suggestive techniques to lead individuals to develop false memories. Recovered memories can become important to identity. Individuals have reported a wide variety of recovered memories, such as for alien abductions and for past lives.",

Ageism is largely implicit and subconscious, often goes unchallenged and cuts across the life course. As a result, older workers are often devalued by prospective employers as being unproductive, slower and more prone to disease, unfit to learn and a burden to highly technological work environments. Research has consistently found evidence of work-related age discrimination and older persons are continuously faced with age-related stereotyping in the workplace based on unfounded assumptions and beliefs and faulty evidence (e.g., older workers are less motivated and competent at work; older workers are harder to retrain and thus inherently less valuable as employees; and older workers are more expensive to employ).

      "title": "Education, Social Status, and Health",
      "abstract": "Education forms a unique dimension of social status, with qualities that make it especially important to health. It influences health in ways that are varied, present at all stages of adult life, cumulative, self-amplifying, and uniformly positive. Educational attainment marks social status at the beginning of adulthood, functioning as the main bridge between the status of one generation and the next, and also as the main avenue of upward mobility. It precedes the other acquired social statuses and substantially influences them, including occupational status, earnings, and personal and household income and wealth. Education creates desirable outcomes because it trains individuals to acquire, evaluate, and use information. It teaches individuals to tap the power of knowledge. Education develops the learned effectiveness that enables self-direction toward any and all values sought, including health.For decades American health sciences has acted as if social status had little bearing on health. The ascendance of clinical medicine within a culture of individualism probably accounts for that omission. But research on chronic diseases over the last half of the twentieth century forced science to think differently about the causes of disease. Despite the institutional and cultural forces focusing medical research on distinctive proximate causes of specific diseases, researchers were forced to look over their shoulders, back toward more distant causes of many diseases. Some fully turned their orientation toward the social status of health, looking for the origins of that cascade of disease and disability flowing daily through clinics.Why is it that people with higher socioeconomic status have better health than lower status individuals? The authors, who are well recognized for their strength in survey research on a broad national scale, draw on findings and ideas from many sciences, including demography, economics, social psychology, and the health sciences. People who are well educated feel in control of their lives, which encourages and enables a healthy lifestyle. In addition, learned effectiveness, a practical end of that education, enables them to find work that is autonomous and creative, thereby promoting good health.",

These risks remain true regardless if the victim is directly or indirectly targeted (as a witness) during the violent episodes. However, these risks are also modulated and moderated by a series of variables, such as the parental emotional and social support, the family’s structural integrity and cohesion and victim’s age and sex.",

The sexes did not differ on measures of depression, dysfunctional attitudes, perception of important interpersonal relationships, experience or perceived impact of life events. Women scored more highly on measures of neuroticism, were more dependent and were more likely to engage in self‐consoling behaviours and coping styles. Recklessness as a coping style was the only item endorsed more frequently by men, posing the question of whether current measures take into consideration the male experience of depression. The findings suggest that many putative depressiogenic risk factors over‐represented in women do not, by themselves, create depression but require a triggering factor or certain social conditions for their expression.",

      "abstract": "This symposium is concerned with rehabilitation, ergonomics and preventing work disability. Specifically it is concerned with determining the state of the science and identifying research opportunities that could result in major reductions in work disability. Disability has be defined as (Brandt and Pope 1997): Disability is defined as a limitation in performing certain roles and tasks that society expects of an individual It is the expression of the gap between a person's capabilities and the demands of the environment - the interaction of person's limitations with social and physical environmental factors. Available data show that there are many persons in our society who are disabled in that they are unable to achieve expectations established by employers, e.g., production rates, quantities and quality, without endangering themselves or others in the workplace or community. This expectation typically extends to forty hours per week, but could be more or less hours. Limitations in performance may result from conditions of birth, illness or injury. They also may be a primary or secondary effect of work. This is the case with Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders; WMSDs. WMSDs are a leading cause of work disability and compensation in many contemporary work settings. Although this program focuses on prevention of disability due to WMSDs, it is broadly concerned with the prevention of all disability. The models and methods discussed have common elements that are applicable to many if not all persons and situations. For example, the above definition defines disability as a “gap” between job demands and worker capacities. This definition applies to a person with paraplegia as well as a person with carpal tunnel syndrome. In both instances, methods are needed for assessing and comparing worker capacities and job demands. The program includes presentations by leading investigators who will draw on their own work and work of others to describe the state of the art and develop recommendations for future research.",

These associations hold across a variety of demographic backgrounds and rival in size those linked to income and social status. Meanwhile, individuals experiencing dignity threat are much more likely to report a variety of health issues. An instrumental variable analysis provides support for the proposition that dignity leads to better health. Dignity relates to better health net of mastery, life meaning, and mattering to others. In fact, it is most strongly linked to general health when these other resources are lacking, suggesting its unique role in promoting well-being among those who are structurally or extremely disadvantaged.",

      "title": "Voice shame: Self-censorship in vocal performance",
      "abstract": "Voice shame is the uncomfortable feeling of being heard as ridiculous, worthless or ‘not good enough’. Voice shame arises when a subject becomes aware of an observer’s attention and believes the evaluation to be negative. It causes intensive monitoring of one’s vocal expression and of others’ perception of oneself. The effects of voice shame are largely hidden, since performers will tend to gravitate towards self-staging strategies that comply with conventions, in order to avoid shame. Worried attempts to prevent shame through self-monitoring and active control of one’s voice, body, and impact on others may cause serious difficulties with vocal performance. Voice shame can affect professional and non-professional voice users. Shame is a non-cognitive self-rejection. It presupposes internalized ideals and criteria of quality, learned through interaction with external authorities, such as parents, peers, mass media or music teachers. The self that judges and rejects itself is a product of social interaction; it is situated and reflects the demands and constraints posed by both tacit and explicit cultural values and educational traditions, ideals and methods. Triggers of, and thresholds for, shame differ between individuals, within frameworks that are largely common to members of a given subculture. Based on empirical studies of music students and professional pop, jazz and classical singers, we apply French philosopher Michel Foucault’s discourse-theory to the analysis of disciplinary mechanisms among vocal performers. The concept of voice shame is presented as a source of insight into the dynamics of singers’ self-regulation, self-staging and self-censorship, and hence as a useful tool for the voice teacher.",

      "abstract": "▪ Abstract There is little consensus about the meaning of the terms “health disparities,” “health inequalities,” or “health equity.” The definitions can have important practical consequences, determining the measurements that are monitored by governments and international agencies and the activities that will be supported by resources earmarked to address health disparities/inequalities or health equity. This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups—such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination—systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. (“Social advantage” refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given category—e.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic group—and all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such health disparities/inequalities.",

      "title": "The developmental origins of dehumanisation",
      "abstract": "Dehumanisation is a pervasive social phenomenon that has facilitated historical and modern examples of extreme violence, prejudice and discrimination. The perception that a person can be ‘less human’ than another person is typically applied to social outgroup members who are attributed with fewer uniquely human capacities compared to ingroup members. A significant amount of developmental research has examined the origins of intergroup bias among young children, however, investigation into the development of our tendency to dehumanise others has been relatively neglected. This is despite the fact that dehumanisation is closely linked to children’s social cognitive understanding (e.g., mental state inference) and behaviour (e.g., prosociality). The aim of my doctoral studies was to investigate the developmental origins of this phenomenon. The results of the empirical work in Chapters 2 and 3 revealed that 6-year-olds perceive outgroup faces to be physically less human than ingroup faces and that even younger children (5-year-olds) are less likely to reference the mental states of individuals belonging to a different group. The final experimental chapter (Chapter 4) explored the effects of encouraging children to mentalise about the behaviour of a perceived outgroup and showed that this technique is sufficient to increase empathic helping towards an outgroup member in need. The implications of this research for the nature of dehumanisation in development, as well as for children’s understanding of human and non-human agents, are discussed. Ultimately, further inquiry into how dehumanising biases emerge, and are potentially learnt, could contribute to strategies focused on improving intergroup relations.",

In this article I explore the main objections to sustaining life in the form of a dialogue. Each of the following three arguments will be addressed: i) that resources are limited and choices based on outcome should be made between patients and between treatments; ii) that a patient's life may not be worth living if its quality is very bad, and a patient's carer may also be being asked to make too great a sacrifice for the sake of the patient's life; iii) that if a patient is competent and wants to die, then he or she should be allowed to; likewise, in the case of a young child or baby, the wishes of the parents or guardians should be respected. I conclude, however, that these are not sufficient moral justifications for not seeking to sustain life. At the same time I acknowledge that the principle of always seeking to sustain life was not reached by means of rational consideration but was accepted from a standpoint of religious ethics, and I defend that standpoint.",

      "title": "Motivation for social contact across the life span: a theory of socioemotional selectivity.",
      "abstract": "Older people engage in social interaction less frequently than their younger counterparts. As I mentioned at the start, the change has been interpreted in largely negative terms. Yet when asked about their social relationships, older people describe them as satisfying, supportive, and fulfilling. Marriages are less negative and more positive. Close relationships with siblings are renewed, and relationships with children are better than ever before. Even though older people interact with others less frequently than younger people do, old age is not a time of misery, rigidity, or melancholy. Rather than present a paradox, I argue here that decreasing rates of contact reflect a reorganization of the goal hierarchies that underlie motivation for social contact and lead to greater selectivity in social partners. This reorganization does not occur haphazardly. Self-definition, information seeking, and emotion regulation are ranked differently depending not only on past experiences, but on place in the life cycle and concomitant expectations about the future. I contend that the emphasis on emotion in old age results from a recognition of the finality of life. In most people's lives this does not appear suddenly in old age but occurs gradually across adulthood. At times, however, life events conspire to bring about endings more quickly. Whether as benign as a geographical relocation or as sinister as a fatal disease, endings heighten the salience of surrounding emotions. When each interaction with a grandchild or good-bye kiss to a spouse may be the last, a sense of poignancy may permeate even the most casual everyday experiences. When the regulation of emotion assumes greatest priority among social motives, social partners are carefully chosen. The most likely choices will be long-term friends and loved ones, because they are most likely to provide positive emotional experiences and affirm the self. Information seeking will motivate some social behavior, but for reasons discussed previously, this will also require judicious choices of social partners. Narrowing the range of social partners allows people to conserve physical and cognitive resources, freeing time and energy for selected social relationships. As such, SST is highly consistent with the selective optimization with compensation model of successful aging formulated by P. Baltes and M. Baltes (1990) described above. SST is meant to describe and explain the underlying mechanisms for age-related changes in social behavior. It is not intended to be prescriptive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Although social psychologists have long been interested in the topics of prejudice and stigmatization, their orientation has typically been much more toward process than impact. Thus, disabled and/or stigmatized persons have often been the targets of research but seldom the subjects. The current paper summarizes research of the last decade concerning the effects of disabilities and their associated stigmas on the social environment of disabled children and adolescents. In this case, however, the focus is on stigmatization from the perspective of disabled persons themselves: How do they perceive their stigma, and how does it affect their perceptions of and interactions with others who are also disabled? Research has indicated that nondisabled persons' reactions to people with disabilities are characterized by ambivalence. It is suggested here that disabled persons themselves also have negative (as well as positive) attitudes toward their own stigma and others who share it. For some disabled persons, such attitudes appear to interfere w ith the social relationships they have with others who are also disabled.",

These disputes are compounded by controversies regarding the nature of the family (Is it to be regarded primarily as a socio-biological category, a fundamental ontological category of social reality, or a construct resulting from the consent of the participants?), as well as its legal and moral autonomy and authority over its members. As the disputes show, there is no common understanding of respect and human dignity that will easily lead out of these disputes.

      "title": "Examining the relationship between suicidal behavior and psychopathic traits through the lens of the interpersonal–psychological theory of suicide",
      "abstract": "Psychopathy has historically been conceptualized as conferring relative immunity to suicidality due to low anxiety and reduced self-conscious emotions (e.g., shame, guilt). The Interpersonal–Psychological Theory of Suicide is a promising heuristic for clarifying complicated and potentially contradictory findings within the literature. On one hand, the development of active suicidal ideation requires a perception of oneself as a burden on others with no meaningful connections to others. The callousness, unemotional personality, and manipulative interpersonal style inherent in individuals with high core (Factor 1) psychopathic traits may render them less likely to develop suicidal desire due to an indifference to enduring and meaningful relationships and/or inability to perceive problematic interpersonal interactions. In individuals with elevated Factor 2, but normative or low Factor 1, however, the combination of normative affect and interpersonal interactions and exposure could lead to both enhanced suicidal desire and capability. Rather than thwarted belonging or perceived burdensomeness, an individual high in core psychopathic traits may realize that his chances for \"success\" in an endeavor have suddenly been drastically reduced and may seek the feeling of power associated with \"going down in a hail of glory\" or cheating law enforcement out of exacting justice.",

As our laws pertaining to wills have not changed, and as the disease—so-called senile dementia—has not changed, why is that about nine in ten wills made by wealthy persons are subject to litigation, and the wealth earned by the testator, which was as much his own as his watch or his",

      "title": "[Adolescent pregnancy].",
      "abstract": "The number of adolescent pregnancies brought to term in France has continued to decline while the number of abortions remains stable. Adolescent pregnancies cannot be considered \"accidents\" either in their social or psychological aspects. Pregnant adolescents carrying to term tend to be more disadvantaged than those seeking abortions. Early pregnancy may be a response to difficult life conditions. Despite appearing to constitute an infraction of a social code, adolescent pregnancy may in fact represent an attempt at social integration through motherhood. Adolescents failing in school, with poor employment prospects and feeling family pressures may view pregnancy as a means of social recognition. But such factors by themselves do not explain pregnancy; the primordial role of psychological factors must be examined. For some adolescents, pregnancy may represent an attempt to understand their own sexual identity as the transformations of puberty unsettle their previous self-images. Or they may be failing to perceive or actively denying the possibility of pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancies may be the result of transgressions of prohibitions. The traditional prohibition of sexual activity has relaxed to the degree that it is being replaced by a new prohibition on adolescent pregnancy and a prescription to use contraception. But contraception deprives an adolescent in search of sexual identity of proof of fertility as well as of the image of spontaneity and naturalness. Use of contraception is in conflict with the questions, doubts, and anxieties of adolescence. For adolescents in a reactivated oedipal stage, heterosexuality is often at the service of incestuous fantasies involving the mother. Abortion and perhaps pregnancy itself may assume the character of a rite of passage into adulthood for some adolescents. The important thing for many is the ability to become pregnant, to be a mother like their own mother.",

Needs concerning cognitive and communicative development have gained far less attention although they belong to species-specific means of human adaptation, depend on intrinsic motivators, and are very often involved in the symptomatology of disorders in social behavior. Most mechanisms of dialogic interchanges are based on nonconscious processes and escape parents' rational control. They may be disturbed or inhibited due to pathological deviations and/or unfavorable sociocultural circumstances, both on the parental and infant sides. Preverbal communication plays a key role in the environmental support to infant cognition, communication, and social integration. The elucidation of its forms and therapeutic application has proved helpful not only for infants but also for children whose communicative age is lower than their chronological age.",

      "abstract": "The central premise of this paper is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In other words, they are like the more ordinary sexual preferences with which we are familiar. As such, they generate sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals will be strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them will be unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct in not trusting the individuals with such preferences and thus in attempting to monitor or control them. However, most efforts to do so appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

      "abstract": "Are peer experiences in childhood and adolescence linked to difficulties with social interactions and within relationships later in life? This dissertation explored whether and how past peer experiences affect social development. We have done this by not only focusing on social development within the same generation, but also in the next generation.An important finding of this dissertation is that experiences with peers during childhood and adolescence appear to continue into later life. Meta-analytic evidence, for example, indicated that bullies became more popular over time but were also more rejected and less socially preferred. Do past experiences with peers also partly determine how parents raise their children? We found that parents' past victimisation experiences were linked to parenting behaviour and parental self-perceptions, but links were not very strong. More socially competent parents tended to have a better bond with their child about twenty years later, but there is no evidence that parents' peer aggression predicted harsh parenting later on.Are parents' peer experiences from the past associated with those of their children? Parental social competence in early adolescence did not seem to be passed on to their children. Whereas we found that aggressive behaviour towards peers was directly passed on to the next generation – especially when assessed in the same developmental period for both generations.All in all, the findings of this dissertation indicate the relevance of further exploring how traits and experiences in childhood and adolescence affect social development, not only within the same generation but also across generations.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes severe, disorders of maternal affection and behaviour and suggests that there is an early process of mother-to-infant bonding which can go seriously wrong.Forty-four self-selected women who had suffered from at least one episode of postnatal mental illness described an unexpected and often catastrophic failure to love one or more of their babies.These women reported absent affection, sometimes hate, rejection, neglect or impulses to harm, in relation to at least one of their children. These feelings often began immediately or very shortly after the birth, and with one exception, were specific to one child; such characteristics are best encapsulated by the term 'maternal bonding disorder'. Twenty-nine of the women were multiparae; first-borns were not significantly more likely to be the focus for such feelings. There was no direct evidence of predisposing maternal personality traits or previous experiences. Postnatal mental illness and recalled severe pain during labour were significantly associated with such disorders which, in their severe forms, did not occur in the absence of postnatal mental illness.The nature of the link between postnatal mental illness and disorders of maternal bonding remains unclear. Because, in multiparae, the disorder often 'missed' the first child, factors such as maternal personality traits or early childhood experiences cannot be regarded as sufficient causes.",

      "abstract": "The use of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) as a qualifying mental disorder for a sexually violent predator (SVP) or a sexually dangerous person (SDP) commitment continues to arouse controversy. Two common questions arise. Is ASPD considered a qualifying mental disorder in statutory or case law definitions? Can ASPD be the sole qualifying mental disorder? We review case law for guidance as to when ASPD may serve as a sole qualifying diagnosis in SVP/SDP evaluations. Other than the federal government and New York, all other jurisdictions with SVP/SDP commitments permit the use of ASPD as a stand-alone diagnosis when it can be linked to sexually violent behavior. ASPD is a viable qualifying disorder when the pattern of offending is atypical, severe, and can be linked to the risk for further sexual offending. ASPD is less viable as a qualifying diagnosis when it is manifested primarily by criminal behavior, the sex crimes are situational in context (e.g., substance abuse, negative peer affiliation), or the disorder cannot be linked to future sexual offending. Case law can provide guidelines, but the forensic clinician as the diagnostic expert bears the responsibility of providing a cogent and sound rationale as to why ASPD drives the risk for sexual reoffense.",

Erectile and orgastic spectatoring were frequent after stroke and were in the males significantly associated. Retarded ejaculation occurred for no males before but for 15% after the stroke. Marked decreases in different kinds of caressive behaviour were followed by discontentment and up to and about half the subjects felt that sexual partnership responsiveness had deteriorated. After the stroke the commonly occurring reduction in general sexual satisfaction was significantly associated with symptoms of increased sexual dysfunction, disturbed partnership responsiveness and reduced sexual fulfilment. The high prevalence of sexual maladjustment in stroke victims appears mostly to be psychogenic. Important precipitating factors are performance orientation and sexual stigmatism. Moreover, lack of sexual information and counselling may contribute to deterioration of partnership sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Of the most frequent negative traits in children, preadolescents and adolescents, psychological and educational research has mainly studied the lie, whims, stubbornness, negativity, shyness and so forth, highlighting their causes and ways of combating them. Over time, the advances in science and technology have been viewed with skepticism, and the inventors have had to overcome different obstacles to impose their ideas. The discovery of the lie has haunted people since ancient times and motivated them in their research to develop an apparatus to help to discover simulated behavior. Lying is an aspect of communication less investigated, but this phenomenon should not be ignored as long as it exists, and we do not find it only at adults, but also at the children. The negative character traits behind the lie are the effect of wrong education in the family, kindergarten, school, because the lie arises for a variety of reasons, some with conscious intention, others without conscious intention. Lying means, by definition, deceiving, but not all forms of deception mean lies; the language of lies is often complicated and confusing, depending on the nature of the subject itself. From a religious point of view, sincerity or veracity is a virtue, a virtue that consists in acting and speaking according to what we are thinking, avoiding lying and duplicity, because falsifying the truth makes the inter-human interaction in society disruptive as it destroys mutual trust among people and conducts to the removal of others and of God.",

      "title": "Stress and Coping in Sexual and Gender Minority Relationships",
      "abstract": "LGBTQ+ is an inclusive term used to encompass sexual and gender minority individuals in aspects of their diversity related to sexual and gender expression. Specifically, LGBTQ+ refers to individuals who may identify as lesbian (L), gay (G), bisexual (B), transgender (T), queer (Q), or other sexual and/or gender identities (+). Given that many individuals live in heteronormative and cisnormative societies, the LGBTQ+ community experiences unique stressors specific to their traditionally marginalized identity/identities; such experiences are defined as experiences of <italic>minority stress</italic>. Aspects of minority stress, including stigma, prejudice, and discrimination, generate stressful social environments for LGBTQ+ individuals and these experiences are often negatively associated with individual and relationship well-being. For example, if an individual experiences harassment for their sexual and/or gender identity, they may experience feelings of distress and be more reserved with public displays of affection with their partner. As such, one romantic partner’s experience of minority stress can impact both they and their partner’s experiences. Relationship maintenance behaviors, such as communicating and coping with the stress together with one’s partner (dyadic coping), have been identified that may help mitigate minority stress’ deleterious effects. Dyadic coping is a process that conceptualizes how partners cope with stress in the context of their relationship, identifying how partners communicate their stress and the respective coping behaviors. Finally, there has been an insurgence of relationship education programs designed to help LGBTQ+ couples identify and cope with experiences of minority stress. For example, the Couples Coping Enhancement Training–Sexual Minority Stress incorporates the unique experiences of sexual minority couples to help couples improve (minority) stress management; enhance their ability to cope as a couple; sensitize both partners to ideas of mutual fairness, equity, and respect; improve communication; and improve (emotional) problem-solving skills.",

      "abstract": "In a society where boundaries become blurred and where appearance serves as identity passport, most teenagers seek to be distinguished from adults and to share with their peers marks which are understood as codes of integration. They do so through clothes and ornaments, and are tempted to mark the skin itself (piercing and, to a lesser degree, tattooing). But these signs of recognition are not enough, at least in their usual form, for teenagers who suffer from narcissistic and identical disorders. They try to distance themselves in the break by exaggerating this auto-labeling and/or by mistreating their skin. Among teenagers aged around 16 years, between 5% and 10% recognize that they deliberately harm themselves, more often females than males. The boys bruise themselves by banging voluntarily against hard surfaces, whereas the girls cut and, less often, abrade or burn their skin. The author describes these forms of self-inflicted violence and identifies them as typical or atypical, knowing that they have a diagnosis and prognosis as such self-inflicted wounds may express a temporary failure of the Oedipal process or reveal deeper personality and/or mood disorders. The author shows how self-inflicted injury constitutes an inaudible language that at the same time seeks relief and demonstrates an unconscious representation of psychic suffering. In addition, the author questions the functions of expression, inscription, and communication of these act-symptoms.",

Unfortunately, although mobbing increasingly common phenomenon in organizations, there is still no serious scientific and technical considerations and commitment of institutions and individuals in the prevention, prevention and above spreading awareness of the damaging effects of mobbing for society.",

      "abstract": "This study tested predictions about development of gender-related thought and action from social cognitive theory. Children at 4 levels of gender constancy were assessed for their gender knowledge, personal gender standards, and gender-linked behavior under different situational conditions. Irrespective of gender constancy level, all children engaged in more same-sex than cross-sex typed behavior. Younger children reacted in a gender stereotypic manner to peers' gender-linked behavior but did not regulate their own behavior on the basis of personal gender standards. Older children exhibited substantial self-regulatory guidance based on personal standards. They expressed anticipatory self-approval for same-sex typed behavior and self-criticism for cross-sex typed behavior. Their anticipatory self-sanctions, in turn, predicted their actual gender-linked behavior. Neither gender knowledge nor gender constancy predicted gender-linked behavior. These results lend support to social cognitive theory that evaluation and regulation of gender-linked conduct shifts developmentally from anticipatory social sanctions to anticipatory self-sanctions rooted in personal standards.",

There are indications that concepts and concerns related to quality of life in older ages are different from the general population. A narrative review of selected literature. Quality of life is described often with both objective and subjective dimensions. The majority of the elderly people evaluate their quality of life positively on the basis of social contacts, dependency, health, material circumstances and social comparisons. Adaptation and resilience might play a part in maintaining good quality of life. Although there are no cultural differences in the subjective dimension of quality of life, in the objective dimension such differences exist. Two major factors to be considered with regard to quality of life in old age are dementia and depression. With all other influences controlled, ageing does not influence quality of life negatively; rather a long period of good quality of life is possible. Therefore, the maintenance and improvement quality of life should be included among the goals of clinical management.",

      "abstract": "The rate of early marriage from year to year continues to increase due to economic factors, family internal factors, and social factors. Most early marriages are still middle school / high school students who do not have good emotional stability and tend to do everything they want without thinking about the impact that will occur. Many of the early marriages have children, where in educating children they unconsciously apply permissive education patterns. The personal circumstances and attitudes of each child are different, making the task of educating hard to implement, and inﬂuencing the emotional state of parents. The results showed that the emotional stability of early marriages in educating children is not good, this is because early marriages are still easily inﬂuenced by negative emotions that can be seen from the emotional response shown. Excessive emotional response is not in accordance with the notion of emotional stability, namely a permanent emotional state, not easily changed, and the response shown is not excessive. In relieving negative emotions and resolving problems that occur, early marriages more often submit to the situation assuming that emotions will be lost if left unchecked, without any effort to fnd a way out or a method of solving the problem accordingly. Although early marriages do not have good emotional stability, some early marriages have been able to maintain their emotional stability by calming themselves down and solving problems that are sources of emotion.",

It is worth noting that such phases, while they may be appropriate for considering sexual development, are not the best way of looking at ego and superego development, nor at the development of relationships with others—matters dealt with later in the lectures. Any prohibition given to the child during the time of infantile sexuality can remain as an inhibition or develop into an inhibition, and can hold up adult sexuality; this does not mean that freedom given to infantile sexuality guarantees normality in the adult—far from it. There was no way of understanding from the theory of sex life, as it existed then, where all the many abnormalities of sex life come from. Even in those times, children before the age of adolescence or preadolescence were known to show sexual reactions and to have genital interests.",

Stress is not the sole causative factor, but genetic as well as biological changes in the depressed individual play important role in the onset of depression. Other predisposing factors for depression include childhood stress such as ignorance by family, early loss of parents, physical or sexual abuse, no social support, financial loss etc. Stressful life events can lead to depression has been explored by many researchers and concluded that stressful life-events can arouse or trigger depression episodes in susceptible individuals.",

Sexual interest was almost universally acknowledged and was of a markedly pre‐occupying nature in about one‐quarter of the cases. Some level of physical intimacy in heterosexual relationships had been established by 18 teenagers at some time or another, but boys, in particular, were deeply worried about their capacity to establish full sexual relations. A capacity for potency was claimed by about half the boys. Worries and uncertainties were very common amongst the older subjects and there is a strong case for a programme of group and individual counselling lo be established.",

      "title": "Innocent Victims and Vulnerable Offenders: Defending Impaired Adults Who Kill Children",
      "abstract": "There are few societies in which child abuse is not a serious issue, with homicide being the extreme form of such victimisation. Child homicide occurs in a wide array of circumstances but there is enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that many offenders who kill children are suffering from sometimes quite acute mental distress. There may also be other factors impacting on an offender’s ability to think rationally, which may not amount to any recognised disorder. While it is imperative that we prosecute and prevent child homicide, in doing so we must avoid overlooking the realities of other vulnerable people. In rejecting a binary approach to victims and offenders, this article argues that sometimes offenders may also be vulnerable due to an impaired ability to reason or to act in a truly voluntary way. New Zealand has repealed the defence of provocation and, apart from infanticide, offers no mitigation by way of diminished responsibility. Offenders who commit child homicide, but who do not meet the legal definition of insanity, will be liable for murder even though their capacity may have been impaired or overborne by circumstances. While, in this regard, New Zealand law is particularly deficient, there is an argument that other jurisdictions also fail to adequately respond to vulnerable offenders who kill children. This article seeks to outline the failures in existing legal frameworks to assign legal responsibility for these vulnerable offenders in a way that corresponds with their moral culpability. The article will then identify and evaluate proposals for reform. As Ulbrick and others observe, in the context of arguments about defensive homicide and mentally impaired defendants, it is critical that we ‘advocate for a greater range of legal responses to cover the nuance and complexities of lethal violence’ (Madeleine Ulbrick, Asher Flynn and Danielle Tyson ‘The Abolition of Defensive Homicide: A Step Towards Populist Punitivism at the Expense of Mentally Impaired Offenders’ (2016) 40 Melb Univ Law Rev 324, 330).",

Psy- chologically, the spumed mate tends to develop a \"defilement ta- boo\": a toxicity which \"defiles\" proximate things and people is ascribed to the rivalin effect, significant others are enjoined not to defend, contact, or be civil to the rival, while those violating this taboo are regarded as \"defiled\" themselves and subject to ostracism. Sadly, such a mindset can extend even to one's own childrewstated or unstated demands may be made on youngsters to eschew or dis- rupt the new couple in order to protect the jealous parent's feelings. But the new couple will soon counter such demands, setting up loyalty conflicts for children. The moral view of the spumed mate, the ensuing polarization of the reorganizing family, and the predica- ment of children are factors which family therapists, divorce media- tors, and child guidance workers must take into account in dealing with clients in the aftermath of a triangular breakup.",

      "abstract": "Demoralization is a feeling state of dejection, hopelessness, and a sense of personal \"incompetence\" that may be tied to a loss of or threat to one's own goals or values. It has an existential dimension when beliefs and values about oneself are disconfirmed. Numerous sources describe high rates of dissatisfaction and burnout in physicians and other health professionals. This article reviews historical and empirical findings that describe the professional and personal value orientations of physicians and other health professionals. It reviews empirical and theoretical findings to consider the implications of conflict between these values and negatively perceived ethical and values orientations of health care organizations and commercial health care entities. Conflicts between personal and professional values of health professionals and larger health care related organizations and commercial entities with which they are associated may contribute to the development of demoralization and burnout. Physicians and other health professionals frequently experience values related conflicts with larger social, organizational or bureaucratic systems. These conflicts place health professionals at risk for demoralization and burnout. \"Remoralization,\" or renewal of morale, depends on the reestablishment of the potential for fulfillment of one's values in the work environment. This depends on organizational, group, and personal efforts. Continuing education and continuing professional development programs should have a programmatic focus on the importance of a values orientation in health care and support program development aimed at recognizing, addressing, and reducing demoralization and its potential for negative health care consequences for health professionals and patients.",

We explored the meaning, importance, and forms of maintenance of ideas of normality among 32 children and young people with cystic fibrosis. We examine the ways in which normalcy is produced, maintained, and threatened, and discuss the implications for the applicability and relevance of these traditional sociological concepts. Analysis of children’s and young people’s accounts resulted in a conceptualization of four forms of normalcy based on personal and social definitions and audiences. Biographical disruption appeared relevant but in a more nuanced form than its usual conceptualization when applied to adult populations. Maintaining normality within the family resulted in continual biographical revision in anticipation of future illness trajectory and life course.",

One scenario anticipates a Prolongation of Morbidity , where quality of life concerns might permit active euthanasia or suicide as a means of saving money. Those who believe in a Compression of Morbidity opt for health promotion to delay morbidity in favour of productive ageing. Optimists look to a scenario of Lifespan Extension , where scarce health resources are not expended for incremental gains in life expectancy but rather for basic research to postpone or eliminate ageing. Finally, those who emphasize Voluntary Acceptance of Limits identify the meaning of old age with voluntary acceptance of finitude, where claims of future generations might limit longevity for any one generation. Thus, contrasting meanings such as quality of life, productive ageing, indefinite survival and voluntary limits entail very different consequences for the allocation of scarce resources across age-groups and among sub-groups of the elderly population.",

      "abstract": "At the beginning of the twentieth century, the phrase homosexual or lesbian family, if intelligible at all, would have seemed an oxymoron. Two men (or women) who openly broadcast that they were lovers and wanted to marry or adopt a child would have been jailed or hospitalized. By the end of the century, in many places in this country, the situation is quite different. The same couple still could not marry under the law, but they could register their relationship as do mestic partners and adopt a child together. They might celebrate their commitment in a church full of family and friends and their employers might provide them health benefits as a family. At the same time, in other places in this country, the same couples' situation would be little different than it was at the beginning of the century. Their lovemaking would remain illegal, they could secure no legal recognition of their relationship, and they would be ineligible to adopt a child individually or as a couple. If they walked down the street holding hands, they would probably be taunted and might be threatened with physical injury. Issues bearing on the family lives of gay people now regularly arise in nearly all American states, in legislatures and in the courts. It is possible to speak of a corpus of family law applying especially to les bians and gay men, some of it quite favorable to gay people, some of it quite negative.

Suicide is seen as a preventable public health issue, and effective prevention efforts require a knowledge of its underlying causes. Suicide rates vary across geographies, sex, and age category. High income countries prefer to report greater suicide rates compared to poor and lower-income states. Ideation, planning, and attempt are the three stages of suicidality, each of which is more severe than the previous one and is thought to develop causally from it. Hopelessness appears to act as a moderator in the link between suicide thoughts and sleep problems, anxiety, and bad social interactions.

      "abstract": "Working with people who have criminal convictions for endangering others is certainly challenging. The place of psychiatric or psychological intervention is still uncertain but for some people, for example those who have a background of physical or sexual abuse, it seems reasonable to provide them with access to interventions that seem to benefit those who do not have such convictions. The dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) system provides an environment to do this. However, if it is ever to be successful in enabling future safe community placements, it has to address issues of stigmatisation.",

In other words, if somebody would insure themselves against health or life, then they do not try to keep their health or life any more than they do not insure. This might result in financial risk of an insurance company. So moral hazard legitimates the necessity of social insurance instead of private insurance.

For the purpose, For the purpose, articles, data and materials about the moral hazard in health insurance and unemployment insurance were reviewed, analysed and arranged. The results of this study are as follows; First, logically and theoretically, it is possible that the moral hazard in health insurance is occurred. However, the evidences on it are very weak, and some of them were supporting, but others were rejecting the possibility of moral hazard. Second, the moral hazard occurring in unemployment insurance is possible as well as health insurance. However, the fact that the benefits of unemployment insurance would increase unemployment rate is not supported by empirical evidences.",

The findings show many important differences between the oldest-old age group and other, younger-old individuals. Marked variation is demonstrated in the verbal scale of intelligence. More than half of oldest-old individuals did not decline, and some actually increased in verbal IQ. Four personality traits (i.e., agreeableness, satisfaction, intellect, extroversion) are stable. The fifth trait, energetic, may reflect responses to external circumstances, including physical health. As for social relationships, most individuals-including the oldest-old-still retain ties with important family members and friends. Individual differences are great, stressing the danger of accepting stereotypes about old individuals.",

      "abstract": "Humans acquire much of their knowledge from the testimony of other people. An understanding of the way that information can be conveyed via gesture and vocalization is present in infancy. Thus, infants seek information from well-informed interlocutors, supply information to the ignorant, and make sense of communicative acts that they observe from a third-party perspective. This basic understanding is refined in the course of development. As they age, children's reasoning about testimony increasingly reflects an ability not just to detect imperfect or inaccurate claims but also to assess what inferences may or may not be drawn about informants given their particular situation. Children also attend to the broader characteristics of particular informants-their group membership, personality characteristics, and agreement or disagreement with other potential informants. When presented with unexpected or counterintuitive testimony, children are prone to set aside their own prior convictions, but they may sometimes defer to informants for inherently social reasons.",

I chose this staging of preadolescence in relation to self-esteem and the online environment because I consider this period the most susceptible to changes caused by the environment, regardless of what that may be and especially in the virtual environment where today's preadolescents have found either a confidant, an emotional support, a satisfactory of needs or even a refuge. This new environment that in the last 15 years has developed amazingly, and which was meant to make our lives easier and bring us only satisfaction, has also proven to bring dissatisfaction in the most unexpected aspects of developing human life. Another reason why I chose this research topic also comes from personal experience during adolescence, at the beginning of this stage getting acquainted with social media and facing different states or changes of perspective now realizing in adulthood as being at that time flawed for my development, I understood that what was created in my mind and later in my behavior was influenced by the new digital environment to which I had adhered without to think that I will expose myself at the same time to such an influential space.",

This problem has been studied and discussed intensively by many investigators, but the evidence to date is insufficient for the conclusions to be clearcut or definitive. In general it has been our experience that criminal offenses against society are committed by individuals with poorly integrated personalities, emotional instability, conflicts with the environment and frustration; these are also found in many alcoholic addicts whose drinking is symptomatic of their inability to adjust themselves realistically to the environment and its demands on them. One factor is clear, however; alcohol, pharmacologically, acts as a depressant on the nervous system resulting in relaxation (to varying degrees and extents) of judgment and control so that underlying forces—the personality dynamics—find a more direct mode of expression. While such underlying forces may be of a passive, laissez-faire nature as well",

      "abstract": "Primates and dolphins exhibit comparable examples of all categories of non-conceptive sexual behaviors, including sexual interactions involving immature individuals, those involving individuals of the same sex, and copulation during the non-conceptive period. Although mammals of other taxa also perform non-conceptive sexual behaviors, the fact that there are so many reports of non-conceptive sexual interactions among higher primates and dolphins suggest a link between the nonreproductive use of sexual behaviors and high intelligence. This link might be because the greater role of learning in sexual behavior expands the possibility for sex to be incorporated into a variety of non-conceptive functions. Non-conceptive sexual behaviors seem to reflect or be influenced by important social factors, including affiliative relations and alliance between individuals of the same or different sex, high social status of females, within-group or between-group tension resolution, mate selection, and infanticide prevention. Animals may employ non-conceptive sexual behaviors to control various important aspects of their relationships with others which they cannot control with other social behaviors, which suggests that instances of non-conceptive sexual behaviors may serve as keys to understanding important aspects of the social relationships or social structure of the species.",

      "title": "Capitalism and Disability",
      "abstract": "The social model of disability necessitates a rethinking of prevalent definitions. Leaving aside biological or physical-anthropological definitions of disability which make it appear that impaired persons are 'naturally' and, therefore, justifiably, excluded from the 'labour force', even mainstream definitions have serious shortcomings. The World Health Organization, for instance, defines impairment (the condition of being deaf or blind, or having impaired mobility or being otherwise impaired) as the physiological 'problem'; disability as restricted functions or activities resulting from an impairment; and handicap as the 'disadvantage resulting from the impairment or disability, that limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role'. This terminology has been criticized by social model theorists of disability because it relies primarily on medical definitions and uses a bio-physiological definition of normality. Further, 'the environment' within which this 'disadvantage' is located, 'is represented as 'neutral', and any negative consequences of this approach for the person with an impairment are regarded as inevitable or acceptable rather than as disabling barriers'. Reconceptualizing disability as an outcome of the political economy, however, also requires acknowledging the limitations of the 'minority' model of disability, which views it as the product of a disabling social and architectural environment. In this view the fundamental source of the problems encountered by disabled persons is prejudicial or discriminatory attitudes, implying that by erasing mistaken attitudes society will accept 'difference' and equality will flourish. This approach diverts attention from the mode of production and the concrete social relations that produce the disabling barriers, exclusion and inequalities facing disabled persons. In contrast, we take the view that disability is a socially-created category derived from labour relations, a product of the exploitative economic structure of capitalist society: one which creates (and then oppresses) the so-called 'disabled' body as one of the conditions that allow the capitalist class to accumulate wealth. Seen in this light, disability is an aspect of the central contradiction of capitalism, and disability politics that do not accept this are, at best, fundamentally flawed strategies of reform or, worse, forms of bourgeois ideology that prevent this from being seen.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is an event in which an adult is involved and the child is left confused, frightened and ashamed (Kempe, C.H. & Kempe, R., 1984). The child may have been hurt, or be excited, or both. If abuse has occurred over a prolonged period, the child may be flat, withdrawn and apathetic or angry, defiant and difficult. Some children and young people may also express their distress through self harm, or become anorexic, or run away to live on the streets. The emotional impact is what needs to be understood, what has happened in the individual's mind, if we are to intervene most effectively. Sexual abuse is of a different order from other forms of abuse, because of the linking up of sexuality and aggression. Such violence results in a very primitive destruction of the child's mind. Irving Kaufman (1989) used the evocative term 'soul murder' to describe emotional abuse. In sexual abuse, there is nearly always an element of physical abuse, but there is also serious emotional abuse. At one and the same time, the child's mind and body are being 'raped'. The child's body may recover fairly quickly once the abuse has ceased, but the mind is left profoundly traumatized. While we do not yet fully understand all that happens to the developing mind, the more we struggle to do so, the more damaging sexual abuse is revealed to be (Renvoize, J., 1983; Morris, M., 1982; Baker Miller, 1976).",

In everyday practice we can see that the number of people asking for the professional help due to psychic disturbance is getting bigger. It has long been accepted that the health issues are not only problem of an individual but the whole social community. It is necessary to accept the principle that this is not strictly medical category; also it is not strictly related to the degree of development of medical profession. This is also psychological, sociological and philosophical category which for sure reflects the degree of development of human civilization. Different kind of associations and programs are engaged with development of social capacities aimed at providing care for people with mental health issues within community. None of the forms of social life and organization is as important for health and sickness of individual as is life in the family. Therefore it is logical that the family is place and object of psychiatric treatment: within the frame of therapy in homo-family and hetero-family environment and family therapy. Family is a primary social group that in relation to its members, besides the protection has also educational of re-educational function.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background/introduction</h3> While sexual activity, including partner change, is known to continue throughout the life course, there is a paucity of qualitative evidence on how adults over 45 years engage with risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), limiting the scope for effective health promotion among this age group. <h3>Aims/objectives</h3> The research aimed to explore older adults’ sexual risk-taking behaviour within the context of sexuality in later life. <h3>Methods</h3> A qualitative in-depth study involving 31 interviews with middle aged heterosexual men and women aged 45 to 65, recruited from sexual health clinic and community settings. <h3>Results</h3> Vulnerability to STI risk emerged around key life course transitions, including following divorce, separation and bereavement. Some spoke enthusiastically of embracing sexual freedom and pleasure within a perceived changed culture, resulting in frequent partner change; however, many found themselves ‘re-engaging’ with their sexual careers within an unfamiliar gendered landscape. Lacking an (ageing) body confidence led to the prioritisation of intimacy over STI risk; condoms were viewed as being for birth control and therefore mostly unnecessary, or linked with casual sex and lack of trust. STIs were commonly considered to be a young person’s concern. <h3>Discussion/conclusions</h3> Information provision alone will not be enough to counter the complexities of navigating the dramatically different sexual landscape these older adults find themselves within compared to their youth, particularly those who have emerged from long-term relationships. A separately focussed approach to STI prevention taking account of life course experience, ageing and cultural change is advocated.",

Health belief model (HBM) is one of the patterns in determining the relationship between health beliefs and behavior. The behavior of adolescents who have sexual relations is reviewed using the Health Belief Model theory because it can predict and influence the possibility that adolescents can prevent or not believe in the individual's own beliefs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objectives: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To analyze how the relationship between perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and cues to action with adolescent sexual behavior based on the Health Belief Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This study is a non-experimental study using a cross-sectional approach.

Social civility is viewed as consisting of the degree to which people have a sense of duty or obligation to society, the extent of their concern for the welfare of others as well as themselves, and whether they help others through voluntary activities. The purpose of this article is to describe the level and distribution of the components of social civility in the population. Data are from a 1995 random digit–dialing sample of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 74. The findings fail to support the hypothesis of social incivility in the U.S. Adults report high levels of social responsibility and invest a great deal of thought and effort into their life and their contributions to others’ welfare. Social civility is found to be higher among more educated, married, female, and older adults. Regular religious attendance, which predicts greater social civility, mediates the relationship of the key demographic variables with social civility.",

      "abstract": "The adequacy of a sex education program for the mentally handicapped has to be judged on an individual basis because of individual characteristics. Sex education is relatively new as it has been promoted since 1956. A sex education program has been in existence in schools in Sweden France and Germany since the 1950s. Its objectives are to provide instruction and information about sexuality anatomy and physiology related to sexuality and interpersonal relations as well as information about the emotional affective and value-related aspects beyond physiology and the functions of the body. Adolescents need a positive role model they can follow and confront. The orientation/limitation and confrontational aspects of the model are important for personality and human development. The educator is impartial but nobody is entirely neutral. The way of transmitting the information is fundamental in its impact on behavior and attitudes and on solving problems rooted in behavior. Sexuality is intimately associated with sexual identification and the sexual role and ultimately with the public expression of sexual identity. In theory a child can adopt the sexual identify of either sex. A child is imprinted with traits of either sex between the 15th and 18th months of life in terms of feelings and emotions. The educator must be free of conflicts concerning his or her sexuality in order to foster an appropriate sexual attitude. Sex education has the objective of furnishing accurate knowledge to help adolescents develop a positive and responsible attitude in the course of their lives. The rehabilitation of mentally handicapped people includes the establishment of a relationship of empathy and respect; psychotherapy in support of counselling; restructuring on a cognitive level especially when body and self-image injury is present; and desensitization and resensitization to develop attitudes for resolving the problems of life.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Although sexuality is valued throughout the lifespan, older women's sexual expression can be influenced by physical, mental and social factors, including attitudes and stereotypes held by younger generations. By gaining an understanding of what influences negative attitudes toward sexuality and beliefs about sexual consent capacity, the stigma associated with sexuality in late life may be reduced. Method: Using vignette methodology in an online survey, we examined older women's health and young adults' (N = 606; mean age = 18.86, SD = 1.42, range 17–36) general knowledge and attitudes toward aging and sexuality, personal sexual behavior, religious beliefs and perceived closeness with an older adult on attitudes towards sexual behavior and perceptions of consent capacity among older women. Results: The health status of older women proved important in determining young adults' acceptance and perception of sexual consent capacity regarding late-life heterosexual/autoerotic and homosexual behaviors. Specifically, young adults expressed lower acceptance and more doubt regarding capacity to consent to sexual expression when the older woman was described as cognitively impaired. Additionally, young adults' personal attitudes toward late-life sexuality, but not knowledge, predicted acceptance toward sexual expression and belief in sexual consent capacity. Conclusion: Attention toward the influence of older women's cognitive health and young adults' attitudes toward late-life sexuality may prove beneficial in designing interventions to decrease the stigma associated with sexual activity in later life.",

Child marriage refers to the type of forced marriage between a child, under the age of 18, to an adult or a child. It is possible to state the causes of child marriages as gender inequality, family honor, domestic pressure, traditions, misinterpretation of religious information, migration, and economic reasons. Contrary to general belief, child marriages happen in our country and many parts of the world, including developed countries. The probability of being married at an early age, especially for girls living under fragile conditions, is twice as high as the world average. Child marriage has short-term and long-term negative effects on girls who are forced to get married. Child marriage, which exposes children to sexual, physical, and psychological violence, also interrupts the education life of children and increases the risk of early pregnancy. This situation causes complications for child and maternal health and the risk of death. Within the scope of this study, first of all, a conceptual framework was drawn about child marriages. Then, the data in UNICEF’s 2023 child marriage report were discussed, national and international legal regulations were included. Finally, the situation in the world regarding the issue of child marriages was discussed and the study was completed with the conclusion and recommendations.",

      "title": "Professionals’ Understanding of Risk Factors for Substance Misuse by Young People and Approaches to Intervention",
      "abstract": "Issues and trends in relation to substance misuse normally develop in the transitional phase of adolescence, as young people begin looking towards their peers for direction and are less subject to parental authority. Risk factors are predictors of the likelihood that an individual or group will be involved in activity leading to adverse consequences. Research indicates that some young people are beginning to initiate alcohol and drug use earlier than many adults suspect. In relation to substance misuse it is observed that risk and protection factors exist in equal measure within different context including within the individual, family, peer group, school and community settings. The enhancement of decision making by young people could delay or inhibit their engagement in harmful activity including substance misuse. If young people experiences substance use as enjoyable and without any negative consequences then it is likely they will not perceive risks relating to such use. Parental disapproval of substance misuse is a strong predictor of delayed initiation, whereas family instability and parental or sibling substance misuse, are identified as significant risk factors placing young people at greater danger of developing lifetime trajectories involving substance misuse. Assessment is central to the identification of needs and forms the basis for the establishment of integrated care plans framed within the context of multi-disciplinary and inter-agency collaboration. Governments and other organisations are required to play an active role in supporting the well-being of individuals, families and communities. As such, the practice of including children within adult categories when referring to “normal” alcohol consumption levels needs to be re-evaluated. Parents‟ and other adults require information about the risks and harmful effects of early onset substance misuse in order to make informed choices and to be empowered in taking a stance in relation to teenage substance misuse",

Regardless of one's views on luck, as random, personal, or magic, people are considered lucky when escaping risks unharmed, and unlucky when harmed. A risk is usually defined as the probability for an aversive event. In high-risk domains, or high-risk environments, probabilities are high, or the consequences are severe, or both. If luck depends on close and worse counterfactuals, risky or hazardous situations should have the potential of generating luck. Such situations might be considered dangerous. Beliefs in oneself as a lucky or unlucky person can further be based on personal memories of fortunate or unfortunate episodes in one's own life, without assumptions of hidden forces or a continued future luck. A lucky turn of events, a lucky coincidence, a lucky free kick in a football game, could easily, almost by definition have been less lucky.",

      "abstract": "Both peer relations problems and moral disengagement – the set of social-cognitive processes by which the moral content of an antisocial act is altered or removed so that the act may be more easily performed – have been repeatedly demonstrated to have a considerable impact on social development. Despite the fact that each has been found to be a reliable precursor to antisocial outcomes in youth, the relation of these two constructs in the emergence of criminal behavior has not been investigated. In the present study of 392 Italian youths, we investigated whether moral disengagement in late adolescence (16/18 years) mediates the relation between peer rejection in middle adolescence (14 years) and crime in early adulthood (18/20 years), controlling for aggressive conduct problems at age 14. Although peer rejection and aggression at age 14 did not directly affect criminal outcomes at age 18/20, we found that they indirectly impact the emergence of adult crime through moral disengagement in late adolescence (16/18 years). This finding is consistent with the theoretical position that the individual who is peer rejected and socially disfavored may, as a result of viewing the world as unfair and unjust, develop criminogenic judgment, and decision-making strategies (moral disengagement) that facilitate his or her pursuit of antisocial goals. Implications for intervention and rehabilitation, as well as directions for future research, are discussed.",

The sample was divided into an improved and unimproved group compared for difference in terms of a number of biographical and treatment factors. Results failed to support a number of previous findings and common views as to the factors which influence the success of marriage counseling. In addition, the questionnaires were analysed with a view to discovering the relative importance of various potential marital conflict areas. With the possible exception of a new born infant, no human being rates himself an amateur when it comes to considering the whys and wherefores of interpersonal relations. Everybody seems to have opinions, and usually strong ones, about how to get along with others, about how, in short, to handle others. These opinions are based on personal experience rather than on systematic study of the factors related to satisfactory interpersonal relations. In this respect, professionally trained counselors can hardly be distinguished from their amateur counterparts. In no field can this be better illustrated",

      "title": "Your patients' sexual wellness",
      "abstract": "FigureWelcome to The Sex Issue: A Guide to Patient Sexual Health Topics. The World Health Organization defines sexual health as “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality...not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity.” Many factors can influence patients' positive feelings about their sexuality, including age, culture, and relationships. Explore more about cultural impact by reading “The Influence of Mother-Daughter Connectedness on Sexual Activity” (page 36). For many of us, it can be uncomfortable to broach the subject of a patient's sexual history. However, assessing our patients' sexual health is vital to maintaining and optimizing their physiologic and psychosocial health. In “How to Take a Sexual Health History,” we discuss key points you need to know (page 6). Opening the dialogue about a patient's sexual health requires a confidential, respectful, accepting, and positive approach to sexuality and sexual relationships. Sexuality is diverse and unique to each individual patient. It's a way to convey love, affection, and intimacy that can positively impact the patient's physical, emotional, and social well-being. Learn about best practices for our lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients and families in “A Center of Excellence Model for LGBT Patient Care” (page 15). A sexual health history includes the patient's past and current sexual practices, identifying at-risk behaviors, exposure to sexually transmitted infections, and any sexual dysfunction. Get the facts about a common vaginal infection in “Danger! Bacterial Vaginosis During Pregnancy” (page 28) and how hormonal imbalance can be a common cause of sexual dysfunction for men in “Get to Know ‘Low T’” (page 30). When taking a sexual health history, we provide a safe space for patients and their partners to ask questions about their sexual health. Our post-op patients may require sexual activity recommendations at discharge to reduce the risk of complications. We can offer proactive evidence-based practice recommendations to support the patient's sexual health. Read more about this in “Talking with Your Post-op Patients about Sex” (page 12). The sexual health history also allows us to identify patients who may be victims of sexual assault. We must be prepared to meet the physiologic and psychological needs of these patients as discussed in “Understanding Sexual Assault” (page 42). Our patients can experience varying degrees of sexual harassment in their school, work, and home environments. See how to respond in this issue's Ask an Expert: “Sexual Harassment in the Workplace” (page 55). Sexuality can be expressed throughout a patient's lifespan. “Sex and the Older Adult” (page 20) provides tips for helping older patients achieve optimal sexual health and intimacy. As patients age, they may experience dementia, which can cause them to exhibit sexual disinhibition. In “Sexually Inappropriate Behavior in Patients with Dementia” (page 51), you'll find intervention strategies. Providing our patients with an open forum to convey an accurate sexual health history throughout their lifespan helps us encourage physiologic, psychosocial, and sexual wellness. And that's what this special issue is all about!",

      "abstract": "A scientific consensus is emerging that the origins of adult disease are often found among developmental and biological disruptions occurring during the early years of life. These early experiences can affect adult health in 2 ways—either by cumulative damage over time or by the biological embedding of adversities during sensitive developmental periods. In both cases, there can be a lag of many years, even decades, before early adverse experiences are expressed in the form of disease. From both basic research and policy perspectives, confronting the origins of disparities in physical and mental health early in life may produce greater effects than attempting to modify health-related behaviors or improve access to health care in adulthood.",

Pivotal to all of these issues is self esteem which is defined as how one estimates about oneself. Lacuna in good self esteem either male or female, one is easily susceptible to cycle of negative and destructive behaviours and would never achieve good health or sense of well-being. It is well established that women begin to exhibit lower self esteem than men, right from the adolescence. The prime role of women is to provide care for their children and family members. Unfortunately, it is withdrawn when they become elderly and become more dependent, considered to be unimportant and are forced to resort to old age homes. The loss of independence, reversal of roles and the transition in standard of living influence the level of self-esteem to a greater extent.",

Higher levels of family conflict were associated with increases in adolescents' depressed mood, anxiety, and physical symptoms over time.

Also, adolescents living in intact families with high conflict had significantly poorer well-being than those living in families of divorce with low conflict. Finally, the longitudinal effects of divorce and family conflict did not differ by age and sex, but Hispanic adolescents experienced more negative effects of family conflict than non-Hispanic whites, and the well-being of Asian adolescents was influenced more strongly by recent divorce.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the substantial proportion of prisoners globally who have a history of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and dependence. Incarceration usually provides a period of abstinence or reduced substance use, but this reduction is often transientand many ex-prisoners rapidly return to pre-incarceration levels of substance use. Substance use after release from prison is affected by both individual factors, such as substance use history and personal expectations, and interpersonal factors, such as social networks. Released prisoners often return to environments in which drugs are readily available and substance use is accepted or normative. Structural factors, such as poor access to substance use treatment and other health services, unstable housing and limited employment options, can create additional stressors that increase the risk of harmful substance use. Given the paucity of epidemiological evidence, the natural history of substance use after release from prison remains poorly understood. In particular, there is a dearth of evidence relating to resumption of alcohol, tobacco, and non-injecting illicit drug use following release from prison. Furthermore, although substance use in ex-prisoners is affected by structural and interpersonal factors, interventions to address problematic substance use typically focus on the individual. Additional research in this area is urgently needed to inform evidence-based policies and interventions.",

Ademas, los habitos y el estilo de vida son considerados como marcadores pronosticos de un envejecimiento satisfactorio y estan asociados en gran medida con el nivel social y educativo de la persona.\n La reduccion de los niveles de actividad fisica que tiene lugar durante la senectud se ha relacionado con ciertos aspectos de salud como la predisposicion a desarrollar ciertas enfermedades, cambios en la composicion corporal, un deterioro en el mantenimiento de la independencia, una alteracion de la funcion motriz y cognitiva o una perdida de autonomia, entre otros.\n Desde las ultimas decadas se ha observado como la conducta sedentaria esta presente en un porcentaje elevado de la sociedad occidental, siendo catalogada como un factor de riesgo independiente de los niveles actividad fisica y con repercusiones igualmente negativas para la salud y la condicion fisica de las personas. Pese a que las personas mayores son el grupo poblacional que mas tiempo permanece en conducta sedentaria a lo largo del dia, pocos estudios hasta la fecha han determinado la influencia que este hecho puede tener en el deterioro de la condicion fisica funcional, descrita como uno de los mejores predictores de aspectos relacionados con la salud.\n Por lo tanto, el objetivo general de la presente tesis doctoral es el de ampliar el conocimiento cientifico sobre las relaciones que se establecen entre los diferentes estilos de vida, la composicion corporal y los niveles de condicion fisica en una muestra representativa de la poblacion mayor espanola no institucionalizada.\n Un total de 3136 personas mayores de 65 anos procedentes de 6 comunidades autonomas de Espana participaron en el Proyecto Multicentrico EXERNET. Se evaluo la composicion corporal mediante bioimpedancia electrica. Los habitos de actividad fisica, horas de caminar, horas de estar sentado y otros aspectos socio-economicos y de salud se registraron a traves de un cuestionario previamente validado. Para la evaluacion de la condicion fisica se realizaron ocho test pertenecientes al “Senior Fitness Test Battery” y al “Eurofit Testing Battery”.\nEl nivel educativo se observo que estaba inversamente relacionado con el desarrollo de la obesidad (%GC) y de la obesidad central en las personas mayores. Ademas, las prevalencias de obesidad central, cuantificada a traves del perimetro de cintura (PC), son significativamente mas elevadas para los hombres y mujeres con bajo nivel educacional.\n En relacion a la influencia que un estilo de vida sedentario puede tener en la condicion fisica, los resultados muestran que las personas mayores que permanecen sentadas durante mas tiempo a lo largo del dia, poseen peor condicion fisica en las variables de fuerza, equilibrio, agilidad, velocidad de la marcha, capacidad aerobica y flexibilidad.\nComo conclusion, el nivel educativo, asi como el numero de horas de sedestacion, son dos de los factores condicionantes de la composicion corporal y la condicion fisica durante el envejecimiento.",

In spite of this it can be said that the biological bases in men and in women are characterized by lower speed and intensity. The old people's attitude towards sexuality in general and their own sexuality is still less liberal than the attitude of younger persons. The frequency of sexual intercourse decreases, mainly because of lack of partners or because of health problems. There are many other forms of sexual behavior; especially, the importance of tenderness is increasing. A theoretical model of factors influencing the sexuality in old age is presented. Practical considerations concerning the prevention in young and in older people, treatment of older people in the physician's practice and their living in institutions conclude the article.",

That is the and when one is obsessed with it, he soon develops the neurotic constitution--always determined to be the superior male, always tense and overbearing except when he is exhausted, and, of course, always subject to the physical symptoms that such a purgatorial life involves. When suspicion or accusation of inferiority leads to a protest in women, it is by no means always a masculine protest. An uncomfortable sense of inferiority is very common, indeed, with women. Its victims attribute it to a variety of causes. They care about all kinds of social relations; they want to be like other girls they admire; and their self-respect is not so steeped in thoughts of worthy masculinity that it is marked. The dominant thoughts and impulses of youthful human beings are more social than sexual, and their social ambitions are not all couched in terms of brute force.

Dai risultati raccolti emerge che i bambini del primo ciclo hanno paure piu astratte e\r\nirrazionali, legate all’immaginazione, come ad esempio la paura del buio e dei mostri. Mentre i\r\nbambini del secondo ciclo hanno paure piu razionali legate a situazioni concrete, come ad esempio\r\nla paura di essere rapiti o farsi male. Ma cio non puo essere generalizzabile, poiche gia nei bambini\r\ndel primo ciclo, seppur in minoranza, sono presenti paure concrete, come quella dei ladri o di alcuni\r\nanimali. Dai dati raccolti emerge quindi che e vero che ogni fascia d’eta e caratterizzata dalle sue\r\npaure, ma cio non e assoluto poiche ogni bambino si distingue in base alle esperienze, il carattere e\r\nl’ambiente in cui vive. Per quanto riguarda, invece, le strategie adottate dai bambini, emerge,\r\nindipendentemente dall’eta, l’importanza di affidarsi a una figura adulta, in questo caso i genitori.\r\nLa ricerca condotta permette di avvicinarsi all’emozione della paura, spesso considerata in maniera\r\nnegativa, di modo che i docenti siano consapevoli della rilevanza di questa emozione sul vissuto e\r\nsulla salute psico-fisica del bambino. Per questo motivo ritengo che il docente abbia un ruolo\r\nfondamentale nell’accogliere le paure del bambino e aiutare i propri allievi a riconoscerle e saperle\r\ngestire.

The empirically defined developmental stage of each man at age 47 and many other facets of each man's life course were rated by judges blind to other data. The studies identified a well-defined, career consolidation stage that falls between Erikson's stages of intimacy and generativity. The results support three hypotheses. First, the stages of men's life cycle must be passed through sequentially; failure to master one stage usually precludes mastery of subsequent stages. Second, the age at which a given stage is mastered varies enormously. Third, the stage attained by middle life appears quite independent of childhood social class or education, although adult maturation is correlated with whether childhood was conducive to basic trust, autonomy, and initiative.",

There are so many implications in human behavior that individual aspects of it have been developed into separate and distinct sciences, such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc. Moreover, the medical man entering this field is confronted with the necessity of considering facts and points of view which are more or less foreign to medicine. This gives rise to the appearance of disharmony if not of direct opposition among those who work on the problem. Fortunately, there is no real clash between the various departments of science.

      "abstract": "Religion seldom features as a factor in custody and access disputes. When it does, courts are adamant they must be neutral in matters of religion. One religion or denomination is as good as another; likewise a parent having no religion stands on the same footing as a religious one. Cases were surveyed in five Common Law jurisdictions, all of which use the best interests or welfare of the child standard. The law's claim to neutrality in theory leaves something to be desired in practice. Parents belonging to ‘minority’ or ‘unpopular’ religions consistently struggle. In custody disputes, the conventional approach taken by the courts is to confine consideration to the social or temporal effects of the parent's religious beliefs and not to evaluate the beliefs themselves. But this approach can still count against parents where the restricted lifestyle dictated by the parent's faith yields a number of social consequences considered adverse to the welfare of the children. In access disputes, attempts by the non-custodial parent to transmit that parent's faith and include the children in his or her religious activities are prone to be viewed with suspicion and characterized as forms of indoctrination where the parent is an adherent of a minority faith. This article argues that an insistence on clear evidence of harm from the religious practice at issue is the best way to ensure that parents of minority faiths are not unfairly prejudiced by the best interests standard. Focusing on the particulars of the case (rather than an abstract assessment of the religion at issue) and requiring proof of prospective harm seem salutary steps along the road to ensuring the law's neutrality is as vindicated in practice as it is in sentiment.",

In general we do not prevent adults from exercising freely made reproductive choices unless to do so poses serious risks of harm to the children conceived or to others.\n\nConsiderations of reproductive medicine, with exceptions such as the provision of contraceptive advice in adolescents, have not historically formed a significant part of paediatric practice. Children may not possess—and may never develop—some or all of the characteristics that enable them to make autonomous reproductive choices. They may lack sufficient cognitive ability to use information; the presence of a coherent set of values in which such fundamental choices might be framed; and a sense of identity, developed over time, that enables them to formulate and implement life plans. But even if children lack these attributes there is evidence to suggest that parents are interested in fertility preservation on behalf of their children.3 Moreover infertility has adverse psychosocial consequences for the increasing number of adult survivors of childhood cancer.6,–,8\n\nConcerns about fertility preservation are not the sole prerogative of patients with cancer in childhood.9 Others affected include …",

      "title": "Paternal Bereavement in Older Men",
      "abstract": "Styles of coping with the death of an adult child were explored in a study that examined the behavioral and affective aftermath of loss in older men. Twenty-five fathers aged sixty to eighty-eight who had lost an adult child were studied through ethnographic interviews based on life history review. Three general styles of adjustment to loss were identified. Men who described themselves and their careers in superlative terms appeared most likely to adjust well to the loss. These men tended to “conquer” the loss by intellectualizing it, psychologically relegating the loss to the periphery of daily life, or capitalizing on their self-esteem to reestablish control over life. A second group of men used avoidance, denial, or a dependence on others as primary agents of adjustment. While this latter group presented as only slightly less self-complacent than the above, they were less able to diffuse or appease accompanying feelings of helplessness through self-aggrandizement. For them, recovery from the death of a child seemed more tied to external than to self-affirming mechanisms. Immersion in second marriages, bereavement support groups, or religion became outlets for relief and sources of regeneration. Two men who candidly described their lives with regret and disappointment, constituted a third group. Lacking the conviction of self-worth that lead other men in the sample to triumph over the loss, they displayed no determination to rescue themselves or be rescued from grief. For both men, mourning was a continuing process that seemed to relate to the futility of unrealized self-potential as well as the loss of a child. Results suggest that, for men, narcissism may be a potent antidote for loss that can buffer, neutralize, and even erase the pain of losing a child.",

Discussions of relative deprivation often deal at one and the same time with a complex cluster of related concepts. Relative deprivation as a social condition refers exclusively to the fact that one social unit as compared with another has \"more\" of some variable, for example, income, prestige, safety, piety. Reactions of relative deprivation will have greatly different consequences depending on whether deprivation is conceived in fraternalistic or egoistic terms. Efforts to find strong effects from status incongruity as a factor in relative deprivations have been inconclusive. But one important set of processes does seem to involve both incongruity and relative deprivation as effective explanatory conditions.",

A traves de la historia se han conocido una diversidad de AS cada uno caracterizado por un tipo de conducta durante el acto criminal. Los asesinos en serie estan especificamente motivados por una multiplicidad de impulsos psicologicos, sobre todo por ansias de poder y compulsion sexual. Con frecuencia tienen sentimientos de inadaptabilidad e inutilidad, algunas veces debido a humillacion y abusos en la infancia y/o el apremio de la pobreza, tambien bajo estatus socioeconomico en edad adulta. Sus crimenes compensan esto y les otorga una sensacion de potencia y frecuentemente venganza, durante y despues de cometer los delitos. El conocimiento de sus acciones aterroriza a comunidades enteras y con frecuencia confunden a la policia, consecuencias que son incentivo para su sensacion de poder. No se sabe con certeza el numero de AS que hay. En Estados Unidos se cree que el rango va de 150 a 350; siendo de estos un 89% varones , motivados no solo por el hecho de matar sino tambien para cumplir sus fantasias aun despues del homicidio. El 50% tienen motivaciones sexuales, siendo el hombre mas agresivo que las mujeres constituyendo esta agresividad como instrumental. Se considera que cada individuo presenta una susceptibilidad a esta agresividad de acuerdo al tipo de trastorno de personalidad, involucrando areas especificas del cerebro a nivel de la corteza y del sistema limbico asi como neuromoduladores.

      "title": "Dialectical principlism: an approach to finding the most ethical action.",
      "abstract": "Most forensic psychiatrists occasionally face complex situations in forensic work in which ethics dilemmas cause discomfort. They want to determine the most ethical action, but the best choice is unclear. Fostering justice is primary in forensic roles, but secondary duties such as traditional biomedical ethics and personal values like helping society, combating racism, and being sensitive to cultural issues can impinge on or even outweigh the presumptive primary duty in extreme cases. Similarly, in treatment the psychiatrists' primary duty is to patients, but that can be outweighed by secondary duties such as protecting children and the elderly or maintaining security. The implications of one's actions matter. In forensic work, if the psychiatrist determines that he should not assist the party who wants to hire him, despite evidence clearly supporting its side, the only ethical option becomes not to accept the case at all, because the evidence does not support the better side. Sometimes it can be ethical to accept cases only for one side. In ethics-related dilemmas, I call the method of prioritizing and balancing all types of conflicting principles, duties, and personal and societal values in a dialectic to resolve conflicts among them dialectical principlism. This approach is designed to help determine the most ethical action. It is aspirational and is not intended to get the psychiatrist into trouble.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Whilst loneliness and social isolation amongst older care-givers are becoming increasingly recognised, little is known about how these concepts impact on specific sub-groups of care-givers, such as older males. In the current study, we aimed to gain a better understanding of the experiences of loneliness and social isolation amongst older spousal male care-givers. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 24 participants, caring for a spouse/partner with a long-term chronic condition. After thematic analysis of the data, three themes were identified: dwindling social interactions, loneliness in the spousal relationship, and living with loneliness and social isolation. Study findings suggest that opportunities for social interactions gradually ‘dwindled’ due to a reluctance by older male care-givers to leave their spouse/partner at home alone, to accept offers of help or respite, or to attend social events without their spouse/partner. Consequently, social isolation increased. Feelings of physical and emotional loneliness were evident, and the loss of spousal companionship (such as loss of conversation and shared interests) increased loneliness. Individualised coping strategies were adopted including focusing on moments of positivity, talking to others and using prescribed medication. Findings provide insight into the experience of loneliness and social isolation for many older male spousal care-givers. This may facilitate a better understanding of older male care-givers’ support needs in addressing loneliness and social isolation, and should help to inform the development of targeted support services for this population.",

It marks the\r\n transition from the immaturity of childhood to the mature adult age which usually lasts\r\n between the ages of 15 to 20 years old. In that period there is an increase in interest towards\r\n the opposite sex and sexually active adolescents are at risk of a sexually transmitted disease.\r\n Untreated sexually transmitted diseases can result in infertility and some life threatening\r\n complications. Early and frequent sexual activity of adolescents is related to the\r\n characteristics of a person, its family and peers, education and the age of the first sexual\r\n encounter gives us only a limited image of the sexual behavior of adolescents. On one side,\r\n adults emphasize that sexual intercourse out of wedlock is bad while on the other side, social\r\n environment glorifies the excitement and romance of sexual intercourse, facts about sexuality\r\n in the media are not always true and the information they give are not always important. In\r\n this way adolescents are confused, badly informed about the facts related to sexual intercourse\r\n and they get less reasonable advice on how to responsibly lead their sexual life. While making\r\n of the final paper, there was a research conducted on a small group of adolescents of a certain\r\n area. The goal of this research was to investigate differences in attitudes and knowledge about\r\n sexual habits and behavior of students in the high school for forestry technicians and in the\r\n high school for nurses. The research was conducted with a structured questionnaire and there\r\n were a 100 participants, 50% female and 50% male. Listed results point to the fact that girls\r\n are prone to risky behavior to a lesser degree than boys and they have more knowledge of the\r\n matter. Younger participants are prone to risky behavior in a greater extent unlike older\r\n participants and participants of the high school for nurses have more knowledge and are prone\r\n to risky behavior in a lesser extent than the participants of the forestry technicians’ high\r\n school.",

As males age, they become increasingly resistant to romantic partner characteristics.

Females in shorter romantic relationships with partners who are antisocial or exert antisocial influence are at risk of persisting in antisocial behavior.",

      "abstract": "In our daily lives, we often come across ideas and approaches that are intended to support and enhance our well-being, with the aim of achieving positive results, such as resilience and health, if implemented effectively. This trend can be understood as part of the long history of disciplining and normalizing the body in Western societies. Functioning, keeping up, and being resilient in our fast-paced society now appear to be the social norm. This status quo creates a link to physical education (PE) as a body-related school subject, where the focus is on the body and its performance. Several recent studies have explored the experiences of people with visual impairment (VI) in PE. For young people with blindness and visual impairment (BVI), sports and physical activity (PA) are deemed beneficial as they promote physical and mental health while increasing well-being and life satisfaction. These factors-well-being and life satisfaction-are closely intertwined with the concept of resilience. However, resilience cannot be conceived without acknowledging vulnerability, which people embody to different degrees. Vulnerability represents a human condition, as all people are potentially vulnerable. What can this concept mean for adolescents who are assigned to a so-called vulnerable group? This article aims to explore this question from a biography-oriented perspective. By adopting a critical perspective of Ableism within the context of Disability Studies, we reclassified societal attributions of abilities. This article focuses on a semi-narrative guided interview conducted with a 15-year-old teenager with BVI who had recently transitioned from inclusive mainstream schools to a state-approved special school for the visually impaired. Thus, she has had diverse experiences in both segregated and inclusive educational settings. This study highlights the extent to which empowering personal and non-personal factors are perceived as such and examines their interaction with participation in sports contexts. The findings critically reflect on the teachers' role in either enabling or hindering participation in PE, emphasizing the need for inclusion-sensitive approaches in teacher education.",

      "abstract": "Giftedness is an elusive concept both to understand and define. Its very nature makes it difficult to capture its various facets in a prefabricated framework. Giftedness has been conceptualised depending on the needs of the society. The concept of intellectual superiority is inherent in any of the definition of the concept of gifted or creative. Talents are wasted because of the stereotyped and rigid concepts of intelligence and creativity. Not only do the schools and caregivers fail to realise the potential of the children but also kill their budding potential and curiosity. In a classroom there are many high achieving children whose abilities are unrecognised and their need for creative and original work is unmet. The classroom becomes an unchallenging and boring place for such children. This leads to underutilisation of the child's potential, and their achievements do not reflect their high abilities. When a gifted child does not get an opportunity for self-achievement he/she suffers mental agony. A realised individual is satisfied and holds a high self-concept. From the social-emotional wellbeing perspective of the child it becomes crucial that identification and nurturance of the child's potential should be given utmost importance. The present chapter tries to identify the indicators of high potential during early childhood years (6-10 years) and ways to nurture them so that the children can actualise their potential. Certain intervention strategies have been developed which try to motivate children to perform at a higher level as compared to their age. Concept of proximal development as envisaged by Vygotsky has been used in order to identify the children's potential in various areas of development and subsequently focusing on their actualisation.",

      "abstract": "Friendship, a key element of social networks, has been under-studied in the social sciences. Chronic conditions can disrupt many aspects of life including identity, anticipated life trajectories and social relationships. Friendship relationships are important sources of support for chronic condition management. However, for individuals with chronic conditions, developing and maintaining close friendships may be particularly difficult. Despite significant scholarship on chronic health conditions, we know less about the ways in which chronic conditions impact the maintenance of long-standing friendships or the cultivation of new ones. Drawing on sociological theories of friendship and chronic conditions, we aim to advance knowledge of how people who live with chronic conditions navigate friendship. Data were drawn from a qualitative study with 40 people with a chronic condition and who also reported experiences of loneliness. Findings from interviews highlight the significant personal labour and performative identity work required to maintain connectedness within friendships. Normative expectations about able-bodiedness may hinder the continuation of friendships by limiting opportunities for social participation for those living with chronic conditions. Participants discussed both the emotional and physical 'work' necessary to maintain even tenuous social connections, hampering one's ability to cultivate emergent friendships. This work included having to trade authenticity for other desirable social gains, such as a desire for social inclusion. This research offers a nuanced exploration of how friendships are created, nurtured, maintained and dissolved and the role they play in the life trajectories of those living with chronic conditions.",

      "title": "Uncertainty and Public Health Research Ethics",
      "abstract": "Uncertainty is a necessary condition for the sound moral and scientific conduct of research involving human subjects. If the expert scientific communities, medical or otherwise, lacked uncertainty about the interventions under investigation, it would be unethical to knowingly subject individuals to inferior or harmful treatment. Moreover, if the relative merits of the interventions were previously established, as indicated by the lack of uncertainty within the relevant expert community, the results of the trial would be of little, if any, scientific value. Despite the important role that uncertainty plays in the formulation and conduct of research involving human subjects, the concept has received inadequate treatment in the research ethics literature. To the limited extent that uncertainty is addressed, much of the emphasis remains on the ethical, not epistemic, aspects of uncertainty. What is left insufficiently examined is the nature and scope of the uncertainty. Often, uncertainty is glossed as agnosticism, indifference, and conflict. Yet these terms represent distinct types of uncertainty, and the type that obtains impacts the epistemic and ethical justifications for a proposed trial. A failure to recognize and clearly articulate the parameters of uncertainty in particular situations compromises our ability to respond to important moral and scientific concerns in the development and conduct of research. This problem is particularly pronounced in public health research that investigates problems resulting not only from uncertainties in scientific knowledge but from institutional failures, economic and social constraints, and lack of political will. Indeed, the role of research in public health is tied to its capacities to successfully navigate such complex questions. The way in which a study is designed and carried out, as well as ethically and scientifically justified, must reflect a robust and systematic characterization of the uncertainties present. Using an example from a study examining the efficacy of using treated sewage sludgeto remediate lead-contaminated soil, I explore and analyze the aforementioned deficiencies in understanding uncertainty among researchers and ethicists. The case study serves as a vehicle through which to illustrate (1) important considerations in characterizing and addressing uncertainty; (2) the influence of the uncertainty characterization on the formulation of parameters used to evaluate the ethical permissibility of the research; and (3) ways in which these parameters might be operationalized in the context of a particular study.",

      "abstract": "Teenagers tend to be struggling with sleep deprivation and sleep debt built up over time as they shift into adult sleep-still ensconced in a world that is unable to accommodate their shift in sleep habits and needs. Changing sleep in teens results in their not becoming tired until 11 : 00 in the evening despite the fact that they have to get up approximately five to six hours later. Therefore, from a general perspective-by virtue of not being tired due to hard wired developmental changes in their sleep-all teenagers are boxed in by not being tired until later evening hours yet having to get up even earlier than they did in junior high years. Their sleep is limited by a lack of tiredness and society demands of school start times, automatically resulting in unfulfilled sleep needs and building sleep deprivation.",

Intimate relationships are an important and normative part of adolescent development, and are vital for adolescents' well‐being. Stages of sexual development include the start of pubertal development and sexual behaviors such as petting and kissing. For many adolescents, these “light” sexual behaviors transition into sexual intercourse.

      "title": "Ethics Related to Mental Illnesses and Addictions",
      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 OverviewThe general public learns about mental illnesses and addictions primarily from mainstream media, including news reports, television programs, and movies.The stories presented usually centre on sensationalism or danger such as those about young women at lifethreatening stages of anorexia nervosa or people labelled as \"psychopaths.\"Or the stories appeal to our feelings of sympathy or empathy such as those about people with untreated mental illnesses sleeping on subway vents during winter or a person with moderate dementia who finds greater companionship with someone other than their spouse.These reports and programs often oversimplify the ethical nature of these situations by dramatically pitting one value against another: self-determination versus life, public safety versus rehabilitation, quality of life versus non-abandonment, and happiness versus loyalty.Distilling situations down to one or two values can be motivated more by the ongoing competition for the public's attention and/or economics than by the demands of concise reporting.However, mental illnesses and addictions are complex, as those who live with a mental health or addiction problem and their families can attest.The high incidence of mental health and addiction problems and their disruptive and lasting impact on people's lives, families' sustainability, communities' well-being, and employers' productivity are publicly acknowledged more often now.In recent years, more and more governments (civic, provincial/state, national) and employers have become interested in listening to those with first-hand experience of these conditions and to those who have developed holistic, integrative ways to diagnose and offer treatments and supports earlier and longer.Ethical complexity is not limited to crises and strong emotions.It exists in everyday, seemingly routine questions, experiences, and situations.The cases in section 1.2, below, help illustrate the wide diversity of ethically complex, \"real world\" situations that those living with a mental health or addiction problem, their families and friends, professional healthcare workers and their managers commonly face.Accordingly, the selected cases involve a variety of participants, interests, contexts, histories, health problems, options, and values.The healthcare ethics literature---which is quite extensive now---and educational workshops and courses encourage their readers and participants to increase their understanding of a particular situation or question and they offer various theories, concepts, www.intechopen.com",

There is nothing to match the early psychology experiments where subjects were often swayed by the behaviour of others to an extraordinary degree, but there is plenty of evidence of conformism. This seems built-in to our sociality either because we have preferences for conversation or status which are activated by the knowledge of what others do, or because other people face relevantly similar decisions to our own and so that their behaviour signals something useful to us about the uncertain world. These social influences can cause mischief. The more worrying cases, however, are those where individual preferences themselves change through interaction with others: the strongest experimental evidence for this is with respect to individual social preferences.",

Less well-known is that it seems to reflect variations in prevalence (the proportion of persons who are offenders) rather than incidence (the rate of offending by offenders). Age-crime curves for individuals do not resemble the aggregate curve since incidence does not change consistently between the onset and the termination of criminal careers. This has major implications for criminal justice policy since the greatest residual length of criminal careers, and hence the greatest potential incapacitative effect, may be between ages thirty and forty, not at the peak age. Different types of offenses peak at different ages; this probably reflects crime switching rather than the replacement of one group of offenders by another. There is little specialization in offending, but specialization does increase with age. Age effects need to be separated from period and cohort effects. The age-crime curve probably reflects decreasing parental controls, a peaking of peer influence in the teenage years, and then increasing family and community controls with age.",

      "title": "Sexualisierte Gewalt gegen Kinder und Jugendliche – Definitionen",
      "abstract": "Im deutschsprachigen Raum existieren mehrere Begriffe und Definitionen, die versuchen, das Phänomen sexualisierter Gewalt zu beschreiben. Zwei weit verbreitete Definitionen stammen von Bange/ Deegener und Hageman-White und werden in diesem Kapitel vorgestellt. Alle Definitionen verbindet der Machtaspekt, der bei der Verübung sexualisierter Gewalt eine zentrale Rolle spielt. Der Begriff sexualisierte Gewalt betont zum einen den Gewaltaspekt und zum anderen, dass es sich nicht immer und nicht ausschließlich um einen Akt aus sexueller Lust handeln muss sondern, dass die Gewalt mit sexuellen Mitteln ausgeübt wird. Im Gegensatz zum Begriff des sexuellen Missbrauchs lässt er sprachlogisch nicht die Assoziation eines Gebrauchs der Sexualität von Kindern und Jugendlichen zu. Sexuelle Grenzverletzungen können unangemessene Verhaltensweisen oder pädagogisches Fehlverhalten sein, die einmalig oder gelegentlich auftreten. Ob Handlungen sexuell grenzverletzend sind, entscheidet neben objektiven Kriterien, wie professionellen Arbeitsstandards, das subjektive Erleben von einer*m Betroffenen dieser Handlungen. Sexuelle Grenzverletzungen im Rahmen einer Täter*innenstrategie unterscheiden sich damit von unbeabsichtigtem Verhalten durch den Vorsatz, in die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung einer*s Kindes oder Jugendliche*n einzugreifen. Dies stellt ein gravierendes Fehlverhalten dar, das die Schwelle zur Strafbarkeit überschreiten kann. Strafrechtlich relevante Formen sexualisierter Gewalt an Kindern und Jugendlichen werden im 13. Abschnitt des Strafgesetzbuches: \"Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung\" definiert. Für den Kontext sexualisierter Gewalt von Lehrer*innen gegenüber Schüler*innen ist insbesondere §174 \"Sexueller Missbrauch von Schutzbefohlenen\" relevant. Unabhängig davon, ob Gerichte eine sexuelle Handlung für strafrechtlich relevant halten, können Handlungen als grundlegende Differenzierung in zwei Kategorien eingeteilt werden: Handlungen mit direktem Körperkontakt (\"hands-on\") und Handlungen ohne direkten Körperkontakt (\"hands-off\"). Alle genannten Akte werden als sexualisierte Gewalt bezeichnet, wenn der*die Täter*in diese Handlungen ausführt oder er oder sie das Kind oder die*den Jugendliche*n dazu verleitet, entsprechend manipuliert oder zwingt, diese Akte selbst zu vollführen (z. B. orale Befriedigung des Täters bzw. der Täterin).",

Marital infidelity is not a socially acceptable behavior and extramarital sex is considered objectionable on various grounds such as religious, moral and ethical. Adultery invites condemnation and carries an implied judgment that the act is wrong.4 A single act of intercourse is sufficient to constitute adultery. Although the legal definition of adultery differs in nearly every legal system, the common theme is sexual relations outside of marriage, in one form or another.",

      "abstract": "Between 1975-79, adolescents between ages 14-18 in Austrian schools were questioned about their sexual behavior. In contrast to earlier reports, an increased incidence and earlier onset of premarital sexual activity was seen. Of the 2809 individuals questioned, 41% of the females and 36% of the males had already had intercourse. There was a strong age dependence. At age 16, 30% had already engaged in sex; 49% at age 17; 65% at age 18; and 75% at age 19. Prior to age 16, 23% had already had intercourse. Early physical maturation (acceleration) freedom both sexually and morally, and a greater independence from the ethical and moral authority of the church seem to play a major part in this development. Love and fidelity play a major role among young people. The change of partners and promiscuity are not typical behavioral features among young people. The reproductive function of sexual activity is of no concern to young people; this aspect of sexuality must be eliminated through contraception. Contraception is a central topic for young people. 85% of this group do not feel that early onset of intercourse contradicts marriage. 95% of all young people want to marry and have a family at a later date.

No sex differences could be found in regard to role attribution. Sings of sex-specific role perception could not be shown amongst the couples being part of the domestic proceedings. Sex-specific differences in regard to the image as perceived by the other parent do not exist any more.

The former gets off significantly lighter in terms of ideological framing and formal punishment. The latter—and drug users in particular—are typically demonised and heavily punished, whilst the former are regularly lionised, dramatised, celebrated and punished less severely. The preceding disparities cannot be upheld from the standpoint of morality in general or from that of a Broad Internalist sport ethic. Consideration of the consequences, actions, motives and vices involved in the respective categories fails to support them. Nor is support provided by the notion that sports are tests of the physical skills and virtues that the obstacles presented are designed to foster and promote, and behaviour that threatens the opportunity to exercise those excellences or have competitions determined by them should be the subject of critical moral scrutiny. Openly violent on-field transgression does not fare at all well by the yardstick of Broad Internalism. Robust investigation of and ultimate change in the values underpinning the disparities is warranted.",

Evidence from Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and other cohorts is reviewed on the predictors and outcomes of subjective age. An older subjective age is predicted by age discrimination, negative changes in one’s social and family networks, lower well-being and perceived control, poor physical conditions and more chronic health problems. Subjective age is also predictive of a range of crucial outcomes. Indeed, feeling younger is related to better physical and mental health, cognition, more favorable personality changes, lower risk of incident hospitalization, and longevity. These findings suggest that the subjective experience of age is a biopsychosocial marker of aging with promise as a predictor of crucial age-related outcomes, beyond chronological age.",

      "title": "[Psychological aspects of aging--a review].",
      "abstract": "A number of models of aging have identified predictors of longevity, well-being and life quality among the elderly. The predictive patterns are multifactorial, and in all models psychological aspects are important. Most of all it is a matter of personality, intellectual functioning, adaptive capacity and coping, as well as making use of one's life-spain experiences. Personality, by consensus deemed to be essentially stable all through life, exerts a constant influence on the individual for better or for worse, steering the individual toward excessive wear and tear or constructive development and maturity. Some aspects of intellectual functioning are more important than others in this context, e.g. crystallized and fluid intelligence and episodic short term memory. Crystallized intelligence usually remains unchanged throughout life and even improves with age, while fluid intelligence and episodic memory decline. In very old age as for instance in centenarians, fluid intelligence is found to be a very strong predictor of future survival. Among the elderly in general, terminal decline is evident shortly before death. Coping strategies and capacity combined with type of incidents, change or threat are found to be strong predictors of both life satisfaction and survival after 80 years of age. Identifying the importance of coping in old age has brought about a change in perspective in caring for the elderly in which the psychological aspects become more important as a complement to the medical model. Increasingly, autobiographical reflections or life-story telling, also when used in group sessions, is shown to be one way of increasing well-being and life satisfaction among the elderly.",

      "title": "Review of Problems of Adolescent Sexual Behavior and the Role of Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6 in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "Introduction: The problems of adolescents’ sexual behavior are grave and far-reaching. Methods: Review of exiting literature via Google scholar, AJOL, Pubmed, HINARI and other relevant data bases on the common problems of adolescents’ inappropriate sexual behavior. Result: Adolescent sexual behavior could result in adolescent pregnancy which prevalence varies widely throughout Nigeria perhaps due to differences in culture and development. Abortion, the willful termination of pregnancy is another problem which is often undertaken for pregnancies resulting from incest and sexual abuse. Also common is trans-generational sex which occurs when an adolescent has non-marital sex in the last 12 months with a man who is at least 10 years older than her. Also related to this, is transactional sex found in both committed and casual relationships. It is not always done for survival because in some cultures, sex for favor is carried out for reasons other than subsistence. Furthermore, multiple sexual partners are the engagement in sex with more than one partner over a particular time frame. It may be sequential or concurrent. The high prevalence of these problems in Nigeria raises a question of the possibility of achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) 4, 5 and 6 specifically targeted at reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases respectively. Conclusion: Policies and strategies such as family life and HIV/AIDs education (FLHE) curriculum on adolescent reproductive health should be pursued with greater vigor in our secondary schools in addition to establishing HIV counseling centers and vocational training programs for out-of-school adolescents. WHO support and commitment to key action areas for countries and member states will build and strengthen their capacity to improve reproductive and sexual health.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Antisocial behaviors in females may differ from more prototypically “male” patterns of aggression, violence, and criminality that dominate criteria for conduct problems in diagnostic systems. This raises questions of how to define and investigate conduct problems in females as well as how to identify differential childhood antecedents. A developmental psychopathology perspective is advanced as one useful approach to understanding adaptive and maladaptive social patterns in males and females that may lead to different developmental trajectories and influence the forms of psychopathology that develop. The utility of de-emphasizing serious physical aggression as one important criteria for conduct problems is questioned. Recommendations that particular forms of deviance in females be considered as markers of their antisocial patterns (e.g., somatic complaints, friendlessness, underachievement) are also called into question. Rather than adopt sex-specific criteria to assess conduct problems, it is necessary to expand and broaden the diagnostic categories to include serious externalizing problems regardless of whether they occur in males or females.",

Play helps young children clarify and articulate similarities and differences in concepts and categories. Parental expectations from birth onward provide powerful incentives, both as direct reinforcers and models, for sharply divergent gender-role behaviors. The meaning of sex differences in play becomes profound for promoting divergence in developing interpersonal skills in contrast to skillful manipulation of objects in the physical world. Some theorists suggest that cognitive growth during the early years is deeply implicated in the marked separation by sex in play groups. Girls, compared with boys, also engage in different kinds of pretend or sociodramatic role-play. Sexual play that involves dominating or assaulting another child must be firmly forbidden, discussed, and handled by adults who establish clear boundaries and keep children safe from hurt.",

      "title": "Narcissism as a Consideration When Designing Health and Risk Messages",
      "abstract": "Narcissism is a personality trait characterized by perceptions of grandiosity, superiority, and the need for attention and admiration. There has been an increase in focus on examining the development of narcissism and how the trait influences a range of social and health behaviors. A key feature of narcissism is that it is characterized by high self-esteem with a simultaneously fragile ego that requires continual monitoring and manipulation. Therefore, much of the behaviors narcissists engage in are linked to the drive to maintain perceptions of superiority and grandiosity. In the area of health and well-being, narcissism has been positively correlated with psychological health, a relationship that may be accounted for by self-esteem. However, there has been less research on the relationship between narcissism and physical health and well-being. There is some evidence that narcissism is linked to a variety of physical appearance-oriented health behaviors (i.e., behaviors that could affect body weight or other aspects of physical appearance, including eating and exercise). Narcissism has also been positively linked to risk-taking behaviors, including use of substances, as well as risks that could significantly impact others, including sexual behaviors and risky driving. The relationship between narcissism and health is therefore complex, with some positive correlates (e.g., physical activity), but also various health risk behaviors. In considering how narcissism might interact with health messages, communicators have to keep in mind that narcissists seem to have some deficits in judgment and decision-making, such as overconfidence and a narrow focus on rewards associated with behaviors. Their behaviors tend to be driven by managing their own ego and by drawing attention and admiration from others to maintain perceptions of superiority and grandiosity. In turn, health communicators may need to rely on creative strategies that tap into these domains of narcissism in order to effectively modify health behaviors among narcissistic individuals. Further research on the influence of narcissism in healthcare seeking and related preventive behaviors would also help to provide a more detailed understanding for how the trait influences health decisions, information that would be useful for both health researchers and practitioners.",

      "abstract": "El abuso sexual se refiere a cualquier conducta sexual mantenida entre dos personas (al menos, una de ellas, menor), entre las que existe una situacion de desigualdad -ya sea por razones de edad o de podery en la que el menor es utilizado para la estimulacion sexual de la otra persona. Mas que la diferencia de edad -factor, sin duda, fundamental que distorsiona toda posibilidad de relacion libremente consentida-, lo que define el abuso es la asimetria entre los implicados en la relacion y la presencia de coaccion -explicita o implicita(Lopez, 1997; Sosa y Capafons, 1996). No deja por ello de ser significativo que el 20 por ciento del abuso sexual infantil este provocado por otros menores. Las conductas abusivas incluyen un contacto fisico (genital, anal o bucal), o suponen una utilizacion del menor como objeto de estimulacion sexual del agresor (exhibicionismo o voyeurismo), o incluso de terceras personas, como cuando se utiliza a un nino para la produccion de pornografia (Madansky, 1996). . No es facil determinar la incidencia real de este problema en la poblacion porque ocurre habitualmente en un entorno privado -la familiay los menores pueden sentirse impotentes para revelar el abuso (Nogueral, 1997). Segun el informe de Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis y Smith (1990) -primera encuesta nacional de Estados Unidos, llevada a cabo en adultos, sobre la historia de abuso sexual-, un 27 por ciento de las mujeres y un 16 por ciento de los hombres reconocian, retrospectivamente, haber sido victimas de abusos sexuales en la infancia. En Espana, la frecuencia de los abusos, al menos en un sentido muy amplio del termino, puede afectar al 20 por ciento de la poblacion (23 por ciento de chicas y 15 por ciento de chicos). Al margen de esta tasa de prevalencia-ya de por si muy alta-, en el 44 por ciento de los casos el abuso no se ha limitado a un acto aislado (Lopez, 1995, 1997).",

Selective reviews are offered on adult outcomes of severe mental retardation, autism, conduct disorders, mild retardation and adjustment disorders of childhood. In the first category, a highly dependent life path is inevitable. For autism there is a small \"escape rate\". With conduct disorders, around half have a very poor outcome. An important prospective study of mild retardation, supported by other findings, indicated that two-thirds of those who were administratively classified as retarded in childhood, were as young adults, no longer in need of special services. Finally, adjustment disorders of childhood only rarely show continuities into adult life. Each category is heterogeneous in aetiology, and multifactorial influences commonly operate in individual cases. The presence of an organic component appears to narrow the range of reaction between constitution and environment. It seems probable that, with increasingly common social and familial disruptions, conduct disorders, mild retardation and adjustment problems will become increasingly prevalent, whereas biomedical advances are likely to reduce the incidence of severe retardation.",

They may operate at the level of interpersonal interactions, as in the case of communication or 'negotiation' within sexual encounters where the actions or words of one individual have a direct bearing on the actions and words of the other. In behavioural situations where at least two individuals are present, choice of action is often a product of the interaction of individuals rather than something endogenous to individuals themselves. The social constraints on individual actions may also be community-oriented. An example of this is where group or community 'norms' influence what is considered to be appropriate, acceptable or 'normal' behaviour. Individual perceptions of social acceptability and 'normality' have a direct influence on how individuals behave. This is because individual actions which deviate from community norms are generally harder actions to make. Finally, the constraints on individual actions may also be politically oriented. An example of this is where local or state health and legal policies influence the degree to which individuals and communities can minimise their risks of healthrelated harm.",

      "abstract": "Research shows that successful development of sexual identity is essential for healthy and well-adjusted ageing. Gay and bisexual (GB) older people have experienced cumulative events throughout their lives that may have affected the development of their identity. In addition, the few previous studies show an alarming lack of community connectedness among older GB people in Portugal. This study assessed the factors that have contributed to the development of sexual identity in Portuguese GB older adults throughout their lives, using an inductive qualitative cross-sectional approach based on Life Course Theory. Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were carried out with older (60+ years) GB people living in the community and using the lifeline technique. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis with a codebook approach. Results suggest a multifactorial contribution of factors throughout the life cycle that have affected the development of GB older people’s sexual identity. These include historical–cultural factors (e.g., sexual repression and traditionalism of the dictatorship), psychosocial factors (e.g., cumulative sexual stigma), relational factors (e.g., relational clandestinity) and intrapersonal factors (e.g., concealment of sexual orientation). The existence of the Internalized Sexual Minority Disconnectedness phenomenon and its contribution to the formation of the sexual identity of older GB adults were also verified. These results reveal important clues about the development of older GB people in Portugal and the factors that may be affecting the current invisibility of these people in the social and health-related context. Relevant implications for the clinical context are also discussed.",

As women, they have been encouraged to be less assertive and more dependent, and to concentrate their energy and priorities on physical appearance, at times to the detriment of their health and well-being. They have often been devalued, and many have internalised negative images of themselves which have constrained their actions. Many have not received the rehabilitation and training necessary to equip them to enter the labour market on equal terms to others. If in paid employment, they frequently experience discrimination and have fewer opportunities to progress in a chosen career. When not in paid work, they have experienced a history of second-rate treatment as applicants and claimants of social security.

Indian society is currently undergoing tectonic shift in its socioeconomic\r\nfabric. The impact of globalization and liberalization appears to have\r\ninfluenced an attitudinal shift to greater normalization of alcohol use. An alcohol\r\ndependent individual spends more than they earn, take loan to drink, leading to\r\nbankruptcy and destitution. They neglect their family, run away from home,\r\nabuse their spouse finally leading to their ostracization by family\r\nAlcohol dependent individuals lose an average of 10 to 12 years of their potential\r\nlife expectancy. When 46 alcohol dependent individual were followed for a 18\r\nmonth period 5.5% died, Whereas when followed for greater period i.e., 5 years\r\n11.3% died.\r\nAlcohol dependence maybe diagnosed by some bio-chemical methods like\r\nGamma-glutamyl transferase, ALT, AST, LDH enzymes, MCV (mean corpuscular\r\nVolume), breath analyzer and blood level of alcohol.\r\nAt the community level diagnosis can be made by the following screening test\r\nlike CAGE, AUDIT and MASTI.\r\nThe WHO has announced the 2001’s World Health Slogan as `Stop exclusion –\r\nDare to care’. Identification of mental health problems in the community is those\r\nof paramount importance in reducing morbidity and mortality.\r\nWith large number of young population and large number of abstainers and due\r\nTo high intensity mass marketing by liquor barons’ identification of alcohol\r\nDependence, intervention, Health education is of utmost importance to prevent\r\nThis rapidly growing epidemic.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE :\r\n1. To estimate the prevalence of alcohol dependence among 15 to 65 years\r\nMales in urban slum of North Chennai city.\r\n2. To identify the possible risk factors associated with alcohol dependence.\r\nJUSTIFICATION :\r\nAlcohol consumption has been steadily increasing in India and other\r\ndeveloping countries whereas decreasing in developed countries since\r\n1980s.\r\n• Due to India’s large population, large proportion of lifetime abstainers\r\n(89.6%) it has attracted the attention of multinational liquor companies12.\r\n• Profile of clients in addiction treatment centre in 23 states showed that\r\nalcohol was the first or second major substance abuses in all except one\r\nstate.\r\n• Changing social norms, urbanization, increased availability, high intensity\r\nmass marketing and relaxation of overseas trade rules along with poor\r\nlevel of awareness related to alcohol has contributed to increased alcohol\r\nuse.\r\n• Tax generated from alcohol production/sales is the major source of\r\nrevenue in most state. However real cost of alcohol (Health care,\r\nabsenteeism, reduced income level) is higher.\r\n• Males of 15-65 years were chosen because they are the economically\r\nproductive group13. Hence alcohol dependence in this group leads to\r\nenormous socio-economic impact.\r\nSUMMARY :\r\nMental illness are grossly under diagnosed and under reported in primary care\r\nsetting. Alcohol dependence is even more grossly under diagnosed due to\r\npersonal and social stigma associated with it. Many epidemiological studies have\r\nbeen conducted in the past to identify the prevalence of alcohol dependence and\r\nvarious associated factors.",

      "abstract": "Economic analyses of sources of legal compliance mainly address the threat of formal penalties. Formal penalties are state-imposed and involve material or physical deprivations in the form of fines and incarceration. The other disciplines, however, especially psychology and sociology, go beyond the issue of formal penalties by discussing the role of informal ones in refraining individuals from certain socially unwanted acts. We define such informal penalties as either socially imposed (shame) or self-imposed (guilt). Socially imposed penalties include embarrassment or loss of respect that individuals might experience from significant others when they violate social norms. Such penalties also arise if one feels that he/she might be potentially judged by significant others for behavior that is inappropriate or immoral. Self-imposed costs, on the other hand, are feelings of guilt that arise when individuals offend their own conscience by engaging in behavior they consider morally wrong. Examples include feelings of responsibility or remorse for some offense, crime, or wrong-doing or bad consciousness due to the violation of internal codes. As follows from what has been presented, the distinction between formal and informal penalties depends upon the source of punishment. Whereas formal penalties are imposed by the state, informal ones are imposed by significant others or by oneself. Economic decision-making models are applied to analyze the role of formal penalties in preventing tax evasion. Such models predict a higher frequency (and amount) of tax evasion than is actually observed. 1 The high degree of honest tax-reporting being observed is by some believed to follow from the presence of non-pecuniary evasion costs such as guilt, social stigma, and reduction of self image. 2 One study provides evidence on individuals’ intention to violate law based on perceived threats including shame, guilt and legal sanctions,",

      "abstract": "Current law in Zambia criminalises same-sex sexual contact while strong socio-cultural values drive a profoundly negative view of the moral status of gender and sexual minorities. Despite this, Zambia's national HIV programme has recently identified the predominantly young population of men who have sex with men as a priority group for HIV and other sexual health programming. Research in other African settings has shown how the sexual health of these young men is affected by mental health. This mixed-methods study, which drew on the minority stress model as an analytical framework, sought to explore mental health as an initial step towards understanding its influence on other health domains. Findings describe the tension, and its psychological effects, surrounding the trajectory of discovering and affirming same-sex sexuality in an environment replete with social, physical and emotional risks, but one in which young men must nevertheless seek to create and maintain a meaningful, if precarious, social existence. To achieve this, in the absence of supportive mental health services or other programmatic responses, they adopt numerous risk-mitigation or coping strategies to attempt to build resiliency and to preserve their psychological and emotional well-being.",

Some feel that procedures to learn genetic defects could take away something from human welfare. The rights of the unborn change with the times. The law of real property requires that the recipient be viable even if not born. Some states require a child to be born alive for recovery for antenatal injury. In terms of the right to or not to produce, in the state of Tennessee, a married person under 18 or single and 18 or older, may make a written request to a qualified physician for sterilization. This legality removes the liability of the physician if he complies with the laws of the state. In the future, the physicians will be forced to find ways of strengthening patients' ability to adapt to changes in their environments, meet the mental stresses they encounter, and at the same time reproduce.",

      "title": "6.C. Workshop: Monitoring progress towards the SDGs: are we leaving someone behind?",
      "abstract": "Abstract People in vulnerable situations such as people in contact with the justice system and people living in prison (PLP) are characterized by exclusionary processes such as stigma and discrimination; restrictions on basic freedoms or rights (e.g., voting, privacy, and liberty); or barriers to accessing public services (e.g., health care). Exposure to incarceration is associated with higher rates of ill health and premature death compared with unaffected peers, even after accounting for the socioeconomic position. Evidence suggests that experience of detention frequently co-occur with other well-known vulnerabilities, such as social marginalisation and substance use disorders, although the extent of this overlap varies by context. These experiences and their co-occurrence might influence health through multiple and complex pathways. For instance, their harmful effects might combine or even synergise. An accurate understanding of the burden of ill health in people living in prison is essential to inform the development and implementation of services and policies that meet their needs and tackle inequities in health. Unfortunately, the information richness resulting from the data science revolution is not equally distributed within and across human populations. Vulnerable populations, including PLP, remain both under-studied and under-consulted on the use of data derived from their communities. Strategies to improve the use and integration of data designed for the general population may not be accessible to or as effective in disadvantaged groups and may lead to an exacerbation of health inequities. In the analysis of social science and health data, the global consequences of social exclusion are costly, including exacerbating poverty and reducing human capital. It also hampers the design of culturally coherent solutions which could be more easily adopted in specific communities. This is not only relevant at local/national level, but it has implications at regional and global level. Inclusion of health data on PLP into routine public health monitoring processes is scarce due to poor data availability, parallel and often unlinked data collection tools, as well as organizational and political reasons. Efforts have been made in Europe through dedicated monitoring initiatives led by EMCDDA and WHO, however large scope for improvement and scale-up do exist. This workshop aims at exploring the current landscape and deriving implications of prison health monitoring in Europe and beyond. Key messages • Despite efforts, availability of comparable and comprehensive information on prison health in Europe is scarce/suboptimal. • Integration of prison health into current and future developments in public health monitoring is essential to achieve equity in health.",

      "title": "Mechanisms and Processes of Peer Contagion",
      "abstract": "Peer contagion refers to the process of mutual influence that occurs between an individual and a peer. Historically, peer contagion has included influence on behaviors and emotions with potential negative developmental consequences, including aggression, bullying, weapon carrying, disordered eating, drug use, and depression. Increasingly, however, “contagion” of positive behaviors and emotions is being investigated as well. Nevertheless, in general, the study of peer influence and contagion processes has been a relatively recent one, with increased interest since the late 20th century. Mechanisms of peer influence like peer coercion, deviancy training, and even evolutionary and neural explanations for peer effects are all being increasingly studied in natural and laboratory settings. Much of the literature on peer influence focuses on childhood and adolescence, and for good reason. An abundance of evidence suggests that peer influence is strongest and most impactful among youth, though to a lesser degree adults can still be subject to social influence by their peers. Additionally, adolescence in particular seems to be a critical developmental period for social and neural processes critical to engaging with peers. Peer influence need not be intentional; in fact, individuals may engage in relationship behaviors that satisfy immediate needs for an audience or companionship, and inadvertently influence themselves or others. Peer influence processes are ubiquitous, occurring both in natural peer interaction settings and intervention settings that purposely aggregate children and adolescents together. The issue of peer contagion in intervention settings is an important one, with evidence suggesting at least some interventions that aggregate high-risk youth can have unintended, harmful iatrogenic effects.",

      "title": "P11.30 Out later in life: working with older same-sex attracted men",
      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Coming to terms with one’s sexuality can be a lengthy process. Coming out in this context refers to the process of accepting same-sex attraction and informing others of one’s sexual identity. Coming out is different for each individual, with some men come out later in life after years of denying their sexuality. There are issues specific to this population. These include overcoming internalised prejudice resulting from prolonged exposure to homophobia, disclosing same-sex attraction to their opposite-sex partners and children, as well as re-establishing the self as a gay or bisexual man to their social and professional network. To date, there are limited services available for men who come out later in life. As a result, many of these men feel isolated, especially from the mainstream youth-centric gay culture. Internalised prejudice can also prevent them from befriending other gay men, seeking support and education. All of these can have a detrimental effect on their well being. <h3>Methods</h3> Momentum is a peer-based workshop for same-sex attracted men aged 27 years and above. The workshop provides support and education relating to sexuality and sexual health. Feedback from Momentum participants for the period of February 2014 to April 2015 are collected and analysed. <h3>Results</h3> Participants expressed heightened knowledge of their sexuality after attending the workshop. The workshop also provided them with an educational environment relating to sexual health. Additionally, many stated the social benefit of the workshop, as they formed friendships that expand their social support network. Many participants felt supported and connected to the gay community, indicating positive benefits gained from attending the workshop. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The needs of gay men who came out later in life must be recognised to assist them overcoming homophobia, construct a supportive social network, and provide sexual health education relevant to their lived experiences to improve their well being. <h3>Disclosure of interest statement</h3> The Victorian AIDS Council is funded by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services. No pharmaceutical grants were received in the delivery of the program.",

      "abstract": "A surprising number of men report a lack of sexual desire, with conservative estimates ranging between 15 and 25% of adult males. Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one's partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one's sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

Much of the broader association between psychopathy and offending of all types including sexual deviance relates to psychopathy's general Antagonism. Disproportionately attributing sexual offending to psychopathy belies the many pathways into sexual offending, which is itself a very broad criminological classification, ranging from hands-off, remote offenses to hands-on/contact offenses (rape and sexual assault). Moreover, some aspects of psychopathy are more associated with sexual offending than others; the core traits (affective and interpersonal) are less strongly associated than behavioral and criminal lifestyle facets. Also, concurrent sexual deviation is a key risk-increasing factor, as are emotional–neurotic elements emerging from with secondary psychopathy such as obsessionality and compulsivity.",

While the Ie gal definition of abandonment includes the common language use of the word, the legal construction of abandonment extends it to those situations in which parents fail to provide for their child's welfare for reasons that lie outside their willful or conscious control. In many states, legal abandonment occurs when a parent is jailed or is involuntarily committed because of mental illness. In these two situations. the state may assert jurisdiction and assume responsibility for the minor child left unattended by the parent's absence. States differ somewhat in their laws on abandonment.

While the questions tend to be the same, the answers vary widely, as they are fashioned precisely by people's location, way of life, socio-cultural, religious, linguistic, and other differences. More importantly, amidst the rainbows of healing options and solutions, one trend predominates: people do cross cultural boundaries in search of a cure or in their quest for the proverbial fountain of youth. Conceptually, this phenomenon is pragmatic acculturation, that is, the borrowing of ideas, ways of thinking or ways of doing things from a culture that is not your own, for the purpose of solving a particular problem. As the borrower, you choose procedures or remedies you consider helpful in solving your problem without necessarily adopting the conceptual paradigm or cosmology of the healing system from which you are borrowing (Quah 2005).Five interrelated premises are particularly relevant to the sociological analysis of people's pursuit of health across healing systems:* First, pragmatic acculturation as defined above is common, normal behaviour in everyday life, everywhere.* Second, given the commonness of pragmatic acculturation, the most adequate research designs for the study of trends in the use and provision of healing options involve multicultural samples and cross-national comparisons.* Third, countries with homogenous or singlesystem healthcare are becoming the exception rather than the rule. Trade globalisation and large waves of immigration promoting the growth of ethnic diasporas around the world have transformed the market of healing services in most countries: today you find a wide range of options along a continuum of scientific sophistication from biomedicine to quasiscientific or mock 'biomedical' options, to traditional healing practices and remedies from ancient healing systems such Chinese, Indian, and Arabic traditions, to less systematic and multihued folk and tribal beliefs and healing rituals.* Fourth, given this wide and complex array of alternatives, sociological research on healing options and people's choices requires clarity of concepts and analytical tools that can identify trends while reflecting the rich variations in agency and structure.* And fifth, pragmatic acculturation is observed at the macro-level involving healing systems and structures, as well as at the micro-level involving agency among healthcare users and providers.The first three premises or arguments (that crossing cultural borders in search of healing is part of our daily life; that to identify meaningful trends sociologists should address not only local but also international or global trends; and that the practice of pragmatic acculturation is facilitated by the wide variety of healing options available in most societies today) do not require much elaboration as they are amply documented by medical sociology research over the past three decades1 and by findings reported in most of the articles in this issue. But more attention must be given to the fourth and fifth arguments: the need for suitable analytical tools and the importance of identifying differences, similarities and trends at four distinct levels of analysis: at the macro-level, bio-medical and non-biomedical healing systems; and at the micro-level, the users and providers of healing services.The conceptual challengeRegarding the fourth argument on analytical tools to study social phenomena, the first requirement is clarity of concepts. It is unfortunate that the discussion of healing options in the social science literature has incorporated terms from the mass media and introduced new labels without rigorous scrutiny of their meaning and consistency. …",

      "title": "Whose Fear Is It Anyway?: Moral Panics and “Stranger Danger” in Henry Selick’s &lt;i&gt;Coraline&lt;/i&gt;",
      "abstract": "Whose Fear Is It Anyway?: Moral Panics and “Stranger Danger” in Henry Selick’s Coraline Lindsay Myers (bio) Fears about the welfare and safety of children have long dominated adult conceptions of childhood. Binary oppositions between innocence and experience, autonomy and dependency lie at the heart of modern definitions of childhood and adulthood, and attempts to break free from these essentialist dichotomies have always been fraught with difficulty. The last fifty years have witnessed major advances in the recognition of children’s rights throughout the Western world, and it is now widely acknowledged that depriving the young of their civil liberties renders them more susceptible to violence, exploitation, and abuse. Adult fears for child safety and child risk have not, however, dissipated over the course of the last few decades but rather have mutated and developed in accordance with modern advances and scientific progress (Buckingham; Beck; Best; James and Prout; Jenkins; Palmer) and concerns about the perceived menace of pedophilia, child abuse, child pornography, and childhood criminality have led to a veritable escalation in moral panic and anxiety. Progressive policies to empower the young have almost always been accompanied by discourses of protectionism that seek to control and regulate children’s lives in the service of what is perceived to be their “best interests,” and for many the process of managing and limiting child risk has become a valuable commodity (Buckingham). The extent to which these two parallel trends (increased autonomy on the one hand and increased regulation on the other) have impacted upon cultural representations of childhood has yet to be fully explored. Analysis of the modern “family film” can, however, afford particularly revealing insights into this process as it necessarily unites both adult and child audiences, mediating between adult perceptions of childhood and [End Page 245] a child’s understanding of adults. In contrast to children’s literature, which is predominantly author-driven, the family film is entirely market-led, a phenomenon that makes it a far more transparent portrayer of the dominant social and cultural climate than is its literary counterpart. Ever since it first emerged in the mid-1950s, the “family film” has been an extremely popular and lucrative form of entertainment, and there is little doubt but that the genre has steadily evolved over the course of its history in concert with social and cultural changes. Sanitized plots, conventional family relationships and sentimentalized childhoods (elements that once formed the staple of the Disney empire) have now largely receded from dominance with films about real-life traumas, broken homes and troubled child heroes taking the lead. The topics and themes deemed appropriate for young audiences have also widened considerably, and films such as Barry Sonnenfeld’s Addams Family Values (1991) and Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice (1988) and The Nightmare before Christmas (1993) have fuelled an intensifying fascination for the Gothic, the horrific, and the grotesque. The extent to which the modern family film can be said to challenge traditional constructs of childhood and adulthood is, however, far more complex than might initially appear to be the case. Although superficially many modern family films appear to afford an emancipatory vision of childhood, more detailed analysis often exposes an underlying conservatism, a regressive rather than a progressive streak, and a genuine refusal to engage in any meaningful way with the complex realities of modern family life. Henry Selick’s stop-motion film Coraline (2009) can, in many ways, be viewed as the pinnacle of the modern family film for, in addition to having garnered a plethora of prestigious awards,1 it has become the second highest grossing stop-motion film ever. The reasons for the film’s success are easy to explain; in addition to profiting from the emergent thirst for “child Gothic” (Coats), the film exploits new digital techniques to the utmost, creating a stunningly intricate, stop-motion spectacle, and capitalizing on the current vogue for 3D presentation. It also quite obviously draws on the pre-existing success of Neil Gaiman’s eponymous, cross-over novel (2002), and the author himself, has expressed nothing but respect for Selick’s autonomous creation (“Neil Gaiman”). Film critics, journalists, and bloggers have all been extravagant in their praise,2 and...",

First, some findings have indicated that parental alcohol abuse may be associated with the physical or sexual abuse of children. Research findings in this area remain inconsistent, however. Second, the experience of being abused as a child may increase a person's risk for alcohol-related problems as an adult. This relationship has best been demonstrated in women who had been victims of childhood abuse. Several factors most likely contribute to or influence this relationship, including coping skills; antisocial behavior; and psychological problems, such as posttraumatic stress disorder.",

      "abstract": "Regardless of how homelessness and mental illness are defined, people with mental health problems are over represented in the homeless population. In many ways, the causality between the two issues is complex. Studies show that having a mental illness makes it more likely that someone will become homeless (Jablensky) but also that being homeless makes it more likely that one will develop a mental health problem (Chamberlain, Johnson and Theobald). Mental illness is also likely to affect the duration of homelessness. This all makes intuitive sense: having a mental illness means that one is more likely to be unemployed and in poverty, both of which are detrimental to maintaining secure housing. Having a mental illness also means that you are more likely to encounter discrimination from landlords or neighbours. It may mean that your behaviour is less acceptable to others in the community at times or that your skills in organising your finances are inconsistent. Many people with mental illness have experienced family breakdown, a known risk factor for homelessness. Conversely, it is easy to understand that the lack of safe and secure housing can lead to anxiety, abuse and social isolation which can adversely affect mental health.",

Death narratives were almost nonexistent in children under five-and-one-half years of age, but the majority of children who were six or older spontaneously produced narratives about death. Children under nine years of age discuss death as a dramatic event to be told like a television story plot; there is no affective reaction to the deaths of strangers, pets, or relatives. With one exception, only the nine year old children indicated emotional reactions to a death, or their affection for the deceased. This contrast suggests that younger children have difficulty coping with death in emotional terms, and suppress or deny their affective reactions to it. Additionally, three children talked about the death of a parent; none produced narratives with evaluation and affective reactions to these deaths. These children denied the parent's death as well, by talking of the deceased parent as if he or she were still alive in other narratives. The possibility of a “distance phenomenon” in children's ability to cope with death emotionally as the victims become closer to the child is suggested.",

      "title": "Parochialism as a Result of Cognitive Biases",
      "abstract": "I discuss several forms of bias, or fallacious thinking, that lead to parochialism, that is, a willingness to sacrifice self-interest for in-group members while neglecting or underweighing negative effects on outsiders, so that an out-group could lose more than the in-group gains from the sacrifice. In the self-interest illusion, people fallaciously think that their contribution to their group comes back to benefit them and make their sacrifice worthwhile. This illusion is larger when an outgroup is affected, and it is specific to group benefits; it is unrelated to the desire to hurt another group out of sheer competition. A second bias is the tendency to de-personalize the individuals involved and think about the groups. This is reduced when people make analogous decisions about individuals. I suggest that approval voting -- at least when both groups vote -- can lead people to take the out-group into account. Omission bias, the preference for harming others through omissions rather than actions, is greater for out-group members. Parochialism can be moralized: people think of it as absolute and objectively moral, they are willing to impose it moralistically on others, and they consider the support of the in-group to be their duty as citizens. I conclude with suggestions for reducing the harmful effects of parochialism.",

According to the results of the factor analysis, the determining features of the axio-psychological design of the life achievements of the individual in the period of early adulthood of the female gender were determined, represented by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: disposition of self-efficacy, disposition of perfectionism, attribution of responsibility, overcoming obstacles, use of unproductive coping, \"futile efforts\", combination of androgyny with femininity, benevolence, desire for success, lack of adequate mental age assessment. Instead, representatives of the male gender of early adulthood are distinguished by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: traits of the male gender in achieving success, overcoming obstacles, helplessness, lack of externally regulated perfectionism, failure, lack of independence as a lack of result, understanding of the situation, reward for what has been achieved, duality of externally regulated perfectionism , affective-conative complex. Gender-based differences between the factors of axio-psychological projection in early adulthood have been revealed: in women, this process is motivated by the disposition of self-efficacy and perfectionist guidelines, and in men by masculinity traits and the desire to overcome obstacles.",

More precisely, it is the lack of some obstacle or obstacles to the attainment of some goal(s) or benefit(s). Opportunities are equal in some specified or understood sense when persons face roughly the same obstacles or obstacles of roughly the same difficulty of some specified or understood sort. In different contexts we might have different sorts of benefits or obstacles in mind. But in the current social context, and in the context of this discussion, we refer to educational and occupational opportunities, chances to attain the benefits of higher education and of socially and economically desirable positions, benefits assumed to be desired by many or most individuals, other things being equal. And we generally divide obstacles into two broad classes: those imposed by the social system or by other persons in the society, for example, the hardships of life in the lower economic classes or barriers from prejudices based on race, sex, or ethnic background; and those imposed by natural disabilities, for example, low intelligence or lack of talents. The initial question is whether a moral society is obligated to create equality in opportunities in the senses just defined. I shall assume here initially that there is some such obligation on the part of society or the state, although I shall specify its nature and limits more precisely below. With the exception of certain libertarians, almost everyone, liberal and conservative alike, agrees in this assumption.",

In most cultures, the youth, children, and adolescents are important and loved; however, in society and churches, they are on the sideline, until culture determines their real belonging. The theological departure point of inclusivity has just not been taken yet. In this article will be argued that however natural cultural behaviour might be, to ignore or sideline children and adolescents is to deny our Christian identity as the church of God. In God’s mind, children are included even before they are born. They may be man-and-woman-made, but in fact, they are God-made (Psalm 127 verse 3). They may not even have been part of a man-and-woman-made plan. Coming into being, whether planned or unplanned, does not catch God off-guard. Being is a gift of God, not only to a parent or parents but to the faith community. A theological understanding of our identity as the people of God compels us not and never to ignore or sideline the youth at any stage of life.",

Even though it is not a life threatening problem, the disease which is connected with continuous involuntary micturition and irritation distresses the individual. Incontinence disturbance, as it gives the feeling of contamination and inadequacy, on the ground of fear of stigmatized by society, denial of symptoms can be at the forefront. This denial sense of symptoms caused disinclination in the initiation of incontinence therapy and to maintain the therapy, social isolation and sense of shame. The perception of the smell of urine of the person who suffers from incontinence by another person, evokes the social judgement in the way of failure of looking after herself. Perception of stigmatization influences the processes of healing by causing social environment to abstraction and behavioral avoidance, difficulties in making and maintaining friends in social relations, and less social support. To prevent stigmatize, it is necessary to increase social consciousness. As midwives make women feel closer and carry out a duty in all types of healthcare organizations, women can share their problems more with midwives. Firstly, the midwives should be aware of the incontience symptoms, be sensitive to influence on the life quality of disease when they make a diagnosis and they should pay sufficient attention to social and emotional aspects and carry out maintenance to the patience within the holistic care understanding. In this regard, the purpose of this compilation is to attract attention to the negative influence of urinary incontience on woman’s life and especially social stigmatize so that improve the awareness of healthcare professionals specially the midwives regarding stigmatize in incontience.",

      "title": "A Socio-Economic Analysis of Youth Disconnectedness",
      "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the prevalence of \"disconnectedness\" among German youth. Youth disconnectedness can have several dimensions. Unemployment, failure in school, the lack of an intimate relationship and developmental disorders are among the most important ones. Many youths in modern society lack networks to provide emotional support, financial assistance and housing. Two problems for disconnected youths may arise. First, when loans are difficult to obtain due to imperfections in credit markets, insufficient investment in education and human capital can result if family and friends are not available to provide support. Second, integration into society is contingent upon the passage of a number of tests with formal and informal rules. Those who do not pass such tests or who do not adhere to social rules have a higher probability of future failure. This can create a vicious downward spiral. The definition of disconnectedness used in our paper is based on economic and social factors. A disconnected individual is one who is not working, not enrolled in school, and not living together with a partner. While there is often a correlation between disconnectedness and anxiety or mood disorders, an investigation with the psychological dimension of disconnectedness is left for future research. Around 12% of young people between the ages of 17 and 19 are disconnected according to our definition. This figure has been on the rise since 2002. There is evidence that an adverse family environment is the most decisive variable for being disconnected at 17-to-19 years of age. While there is no evidence that an immigrant background per se contributes to disconnectedness, adolescents with an immigrant background are overrepresented among the disconnected. Disconnectedness seems to stem from having parents with a low educational level and/or from growing up in a broken home. Parents in such families have difficulty providing emotional and material support for their offspring in times of developmental change as well as in times of economic hardship. We find evidence that economic downturns contribute to disconnectedness with a delayed effect. Following a recession, the most disadvantaged youths seem to suffer most, presumably because recessions aggravate the wounds left from early life adversity. Our results suggest that the current economic crisis will result in an increase in youth disconnectedness in the coming years. In sum, disconnectedness seems to result from low-quality adult mentoring in developmental periods when mentoring is most needed. Finally, a word as to what the paper does not do may be appropriate here. The paper does not contribute to a better understanding of public programmes for disadvantaged youths, which is a topic left to future research.",

But even altruistic sacrifice depends on two elements that border on the measurable—\"solidarity\" and \"hope.\" If one gives up a good without reward—whether present or future, in this world or any other—one does so because the beneficiary of the sacrifice in some sense remains oneself. Such solidarity with family members, friends, or benefactors seems so common that sociobiologists have sought Darwinian explanation for it. The quality of one's life depends not merely on the quantity of goods and services one uses, but also on what others have and do. Envy is the displeasure that one derives from the prosperity of another; solidarity produces the pleasure that one derives from the prosperity of a person not completely apart from oneself.",

Moreover, there are few circumstances that present psychoanalysts with more intricate, distressing, and potentially problematic clinical dilemmas and challenges than the treatment of incest victims or the handling of situations where incest has been suspected or alleged by one family member, only to be vehemently denied, often accompanied by pain and outrage, by the accused individual and/or other members of the family",

Previous research demonstrates the willingness of individuals to harmothers, but little is understood about how far people are willing to go in being spiteful or theirconsistency in spitefulness across repeated trials. Our experiment is the first to provideindividuals with repeated opportunities to spitefully harm anonymous others when the decisionentails zero cost to the spiter and cannot be observed by the object of spite. This method revealsthat the majority of individuals exhibit consistent (non-)spitefulness over time and that thedistribution of spitefulness is bipolar: when choosing whether to be spiteful, most individualseither avoid spite altogether or impose the maximum possible harm on their unwitting victims.",

      "abstract": "The article examines the relationship between self-assessment of human greed and assessment of the greed of the others. It has been shown that young people's perceptions of greed are ambivalent: greed is described as a defect, something bad that makes a person vulnerable, lowers his/her self-esteem, causes trouble, prevents him/her from living a full life and reduces the ability to acquire what is desired. On the other hand, young people pay attention to the fact that due to their greed they are careful about their own funds, control costs and consolidate resources for large purchases. The greed of others is also ambiguous: it can be an obstacle to satisfying the desires of young people, or it can be one that does not affect their goals achievements. The greed of the others is an obstacle to satisfying the desires of young people, achieving their goals. The assessment of the others' greed varied depending on the degree of these people intimacy. The characteristics of relatives, friends, people who they study or work with, were similar to the data obtained in the self-assessment of greed. However, when assessing the greed of the people who run the city and the country, the subjects attributed to them a higher degree of greed. The positive connection between the assessment of one's own greed and the assessment of the greed of relatives, friends and colleagues is determined. No significant relationship was found between the assessment of one's own greed and the greed of the people who run a city or country.",

An change design is used, testing whether preadult attitudes persist even when individuals are exposed to new social norms in later life. Adult levels of social tolerance are influenced by both preadult and early adult attitudinal environments, supporting the persistence hypothesis, especially in its revisionist version. Microenvironment tolerance norms normally show great continuity across most individuals' life spans, minimizing the clash of adult environments with preadult socialization. In the unusual cases when the two environments do conflict, both significantly influence the individual's ultimate level of social tolerance. Persistence thus may be due both to the lasting power of early experience and to environmental continuity throughout the life span.",

Accordingly, the practices of subordination and marginalization described in hegemonic masculinity theory are not used to regulate masculine behaviors or obtain dominance in this setting. At Standard High, boys ascribing to different masculine archetypes can each maintain high social status. Nonetheless, a social hierarchy still exists. Here, boys are stratified in accordance to a popularity ranking, which is determined by the possession of a matrix of variables: Namely, charisma, authenticity, emotional support, and social fluidity.",

In those structural contexts, however, where these changes in status are prevalent, it is the still married or employed individual who occupies a deviant position in relation to his peers and whose social life therefore tends to become more restricted.",

The studies cited in the article show that people with low self-esteem do not reduce their tension after confessing to failures, because they cannot appreciate the support of a partner, in turn success or positive labels can increase the sense of conditional acceptance.",

Such a posture likely falsifies the clinical perception of the individual referred for \"treatment.\" Assessment and interventions for these youth must be holistic and idiosyncratic, considering numerous multiplex developmental variables (i.e., overall human sexual development, gender identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation, erotic development, intimacy deficits, adverse childhood experiences/trauma), as well as sociological and anthropological fundamentals. The lens for assessing and intervening with youth must also include in its focus the constantly changing Zeitgeist, that is, the spirit or the mood of the times. The proposed lens is applicable to all youth, adjudicated and non-adjudicated. Specific considerations are discussed related to those youth with a history of significant child maltreatment who later engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or sexually abusive behaviors.",

The secret offender's breastplate of righteousness is not limited to right-wing social and political attitudes. His performance of duties as husband, father, neighbor, and friend is likewise bent in a direction that might give credence to his life of respectability. However, for the vast majority, the unseen deviants, the breastplate of righteousness replaces the offensive weapons of all but the most conservative political action. There appear to be two variables that interact with other social characteristics to determine the life style and sociopolitical position of any type of deviant actor. First, the intensity of anticipated sanctions against the particular deviant behavior; second, the degree of autonomy governing the control of information.",

The necessary diagnostic criterion for gender identity disorder of childhood is the presence of a constant desire to belong (or the conviction of belonging) to the opposite sex, coupled with a strong denial of the behavior, characteristics and/or clothing specific to the registered sex. Usually the disorder is manifested in the preschool years, but for diagnosing it is necessary that it manifests before the onset of puberty. Both sexes may have a rejection of anatomical structures inherent in his own sex; however, such unusual display is rare. Patient V. came to the appointment with psychiatrist with parents 3 years ago. During the interview reported that she starts to feel the boy at the age of 9 years. This announcement provoked outrage from parents. With the beginning of the critical days began to position herself in a male person. The patient met all diagnostic criteria for gender identity disorder of childhood. The patient underwent a course of systemic therapy combined with nootropics. Currently, patient name is the name of a female, the patient wears women's clothing, identifies herself as a woman. The patient continues to meet with a psychotherapist, is satisfied with the treatment, thoughts on sex change does not express. Thus, in the case of diagnosis of this disorder can become effective systemic therapy in combination with nootropics.

Results from a Dutch sample involving 131 unpartnered men and women between the ages of 65 and 75 indicate that the absence of friendship support rather than being single is an important determinant of loneliness. In accordance with the theory of mental incongruity, relationship standards and perceived opportunities for improving relationships are also shown to be significantly associated with loneliness. Older men and women without a partner are most vulnerable to loneliness when they have a high partner standard or a low singlehood standard, and see few opportunities to change their situation (for example, as a result of experienced health restrictions). A better understanding of loneliness is obtained if not only the quality of relationships is considered, but also the degree of congruity between relationships and relationship standards, and the favorability of perceived opportunities for bringing about improvements.",

En efecto la libertad sexual y tal como lo indica la doctrina, tiene dos vertientes una positiva y otra negativa, que no han de considerarse opuestas, sino complementarias. La positiva atiende a la libre disposicion de la persona de sus propias potencialidades sexuales, tanto en el comportamiento particular como frente a los demas. En la negativa recae el aspecto defensivo, esto es en el derecho de la persona a no verse involucrada por otra persona sin su consentimiento en un contexto sexual. La contravencion al segundo ambito de la libertad sexual es reprimida en el Codigo Penal a tal punto que las penas a imponerse resultan de las mas elevadas y energicas que contempla nuestro ordenamiento, toda vez que uno de los grupos de delitos mas censurables y graves previsto y que mayor alarma en la poblacion genera son justamente los delitos contra libertad indemnidad sexual.",

      "abstract": "The urgency to global political life that Shirin Rai points to in the lead article of this Forum is one that is, in major part, borne of a global crisis of social reproduction. This crisis is less immediately visible than the rise of terrorism, right-wing nationalism, or military conflict, but no less harmful, violent or deadly in its effects. Where the basic means for reproducing and sustaining labor power are so severely compromised as to undercut human life, or to curtail care for human welfare that would otherwise reproduce people as physical, social, and cultural beings, then this constitutes a political urgency like no other. Rarely does this crisis occupy the minds of legislators and politicians, but the stakes are high. At the extreme, it manifests itself in the truncation of or exclusion from life itself. It is expressed in, for example, the daily tolls of 30,000 children under 5 years old who die from avoidable diseases1 and the 830 women who die of complications related to pregnancy or childbirth.2 Almost all of these deaths are attributable to the absence or inadequacy of the necessary organized social provision, services, and arrangements that underpin the right to means of social participation. Fundamentally responsible for this exclusion is “unavailable, inaccessible, unaffordable, or poor quality care” (WHO 2016). The relationship between low state investment in health care and education and higher maternal and child mortality is clear (Karlsen et al. 2011), as is the fact that most of these deaths occur in low-resource settings in “developing” countries.",

Societal dysfunctions and the modern rat race has led to the breakup of the family unit, bringing along a lack of parenting and value systems. The need to belong, however inadequately, comes across as a sign of changing times and values. Success, failure, low self esteem, low job opportunities, problems of identity etc., are nodes in a viscous cycle of self destruction. Not the least impediment in this cycle is the example set by our peers and role models of over-indulgence in mood altering substances which is justified by them as stress reducing agents. With advancing addictive behaviour, a balanced lifestyle takes a back seat. For, as many that fall victim to substance abuse, many more, through individual example and dysfunctional families, perpetuate addictive behaviours, addictive logic and self destructive coping mechanisms. Obsessive and compulsive addictions include work, sex, food, gambling and many more. As the newer trend of “Polydrug abuse” is experienced and observed across the globe, it becomes essential to focus treatment strategies onto the whole person instead of focusing upon the visible symptoms of addiction. Addiction is all pervasive; it is a disease as listed in the DSM 4 of the American Psychiatric Association. It is a disease of relationships - lack of human ones and a compensatory attachment to other things. It is also a disease of attitudes, reinforcing the fact that being substance free without commensurate change of lifestyle or spiritual awakening invariably tends to result in relapse. Addiction is an abnormal relationship with an object or an event. The individual departs from the normal and socially accepted functions of the object or event and sets up with it a pathological relationship. For the addict - the food, sex act or the drug takes up a new function. Under relatively normal circumstances, human beings get their emotional and intimacy needs met by connecting with other human beings, their own selves, their community and with a spiritual power greater than themselves. It is through a balanced combination of these relationships that people get healthy emotional nurturance. This way of acting intimately involves a pattern of reaching out to life. In addictive patterns of behaviour this reaching out motion is almost totally inward, bordering on the point of withdrawal. As Craig Nakkan (Ref.14) points out; addiction exists within the person and when an individual connects with his addiction he withdraws from external relationships. This is what underlies the social inadequacy aspect of addiction. The longer that an addictive illness progresses, the less a person feels the ability to have meaningful relationships with others. An addictive lifestyle is marked by a progressive loss of control and an emotional evading of the realities of living. Addiction is an emotional illusion - an illusion of meeting emotional needs through addictive behaviours. It is a commitment to a negative and self destructive way of living; basically a faulty mechanism of coping - a repetitive seeking of the illusion of relief through avoidance of reality and its consequences. In dealing with this extremely complex problem of addiction, practical strategies concentrate on demand reduction activities instead of on supply reduction approaches. In polydrug and substitute addictions any numbers of escape routes are available to allow the “unchanged” client to continue his indulgence of self gratification and opt not to be “in recovery”. “Whole Person Recovery” begins with an abstinence from drugs and other chemicals and progresses towards maintaining a drug free life style in terms of actions - working towards the top priority of remaining drug free. Along with this, it is also important to have acceptance and a sense of reverence for higher values and a spiritual way of life. Adapting to work and responsibility by balancing self reliance and interdependence with others and by following a self disciplined routine is vital to the recovery process. If addiction is viewed in terms of social inadequacy “Whole Person Recovery” requires reestablishing comfortable and honest relationships with others.

      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim’s prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim’s sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim’s physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman’s thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. \r\n\r\nThe same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception—women who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic conflict among feelings of entitlement, defectiveness, and deprivation is discussed from the perspective of superego defense against dangerously aggressive (and sexual) wishes. These negative feelings and negative self-images are exploited so as to appease the superego in the face of one's hostile aggression: that one is justified, that there are extenuating circumstances for one's hatred and destructiveness. The \"oral\" clamor of deprivation and entitlement, together with dependency, submissiveness, and defensive uncertainty, serve a screening function for hostile aggressive wishes, from any developmental level. Typically, attitudes of entitlement are contradictory, unclear, and wavering, because of conflict between differing ego ideal images, and conflict between superego, and ego and id, about the sadistic extractiveness in these attitudes. Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past trauma, deprivation, abuse, teasing overstimulation coupled with neglect, or alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--exploitation and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.",

      "title": "Age and Gender Effects in Sensitivity to Social Rewards in Adolescents and Young Adults",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a sensitive period for socio-cultural processing and a vast literature has established that adolescents are exceptionally attuned to the social context. Theoretical accounts posit that the social reward of social interactions plays a large role in adolescent sensitivity to the social context. Yet, to date it is unclear how sensitivity to social reward develops across adolescence and young adulthood and whether there are gender differences. The present cross sectional study (N = 271 participants, age 11-28 years) examined age and gender effects in self-reported sensitivity to different types of social rewards. In order to achieve this aim, the Dutch Social Reward Questionnaire for Adolescents (SRQ-A) was validated. Findings revealed that each type of social reward was characterized by distinct age and gender effects. Feeling rewarded by gaining positive attention from others showed a peak in late adolescence, while enjoying positive reciprocal relationships with others showed a linear increase with age. Enjoying cruel behavior towards others decreased with age for girls, while boys showed no changes with age and reported higher levels across ages. Reward from giving others control showed a mid-adolescent dip, while enjoying group interactions did not show any changes with age. Taken together, the results imply that the social reward of social interactions is a nuanced and complex construct, which encompasses multiple components that show unique effects with age and gender. These findings enable us to gain further traction on the ubiquitous effects of the social context on decision-making in adolescent's lives.",

      "title": "[Resistance to contraception by adolescents].",
      "abstract": "The reasons why adolescents resist the use of contraception are discussed. Some adolescents believe that their love is too ideal to be associated with the practical and mechanical nature of contraceptive use. Psychic stress can cause adolescents to refuse to use oral contraception. Fear of side effects can contribute to this refusal as can a feeling of rebellion against the family or society. Some adolescents feel that the purity of their motives is put in doubt if they take advance contraceptive precautions. Some refuse to use contraceptives to punish themselves for the consequences of their actions a type of masochism. Some adolescents who have not had family lives want to have children which they later abandon. Impulsiveness of fulfillment of sexual needs may prevent adolescents from using oral contraceptives. Adolescents are caught between being sensual and chaste and have difficulty in figuring out the consequences of their acts. Memories of infancy resurge in the minds of adolescents. Adults having experienced adolescence can have an important role to play in shaping the attitude of adolescents regarding contraception. They can perceive if the resistance to contraceptive use is normal or not and can work to give adolescents the means to make responsible decisions for themselves.",

      "abstract": "Engagement in occupation is as an innate behaviour; an integral and defining aspect of human-ness. The notion of humans as occupational beings endowed with capacities which depend on many complex sub-systems, such as the physical, socio-cultural and transcendental, is central to our understanding. The participation in complex, skilled activities within the domains of self-care, leisure and work is seen as health giving and sustaining. Without this engagement, their health and well-being might be negatively affected. Occupational deprivation is a state of long-lasting exclusion from meaningful occupations, due to circumstances beyond the control of the individual.\nIt is proposed here that present research interest into the specific effects of deprivation may yet take too little account of the situation faced by individuals with complex neurological disabilities who are living within very supportive environments, but nevertheless experiencing a form of deprivation. This paper explores some issues from the literature around occupational deprivation linked to intrinsic causes. Realisation of the negative effects of deprivation might lead to more sustained effort in at least, enhancing opportunities for engagement in enjoyable activities.",

Play changes across time(s) as individuals construct or produce and interact within their society, culture. The belief that development is a lifelong process raises a number of conceptual and philosophical issues. The interactive process of growth is a second assumption common to life-span perspectives. Chronological age, or years since birth, represents an individual’s capabilities or level of functioning. The time of measurement is the third type of time to consider from a life-span perspective. Stability and change in motivations for play or leisure across the life span have been the focus of much research. In forms of play across the life span change and continuity are often difficult to identify because the form of activity may remain the same while the type of engagement and satisfactions sought in and motivations for the activity change.",

Women more frequently have problems in experiencing sexual arousal and pleasure, whereas men more often suffer from erectile dysfunction or dysfunctional ejaculation. From an evolutionary point of view, many sexual dysfunctions are caused by conflict relating to intra- and intersexual competition or cultural practices of controlling sexual activity of the opposite sex. Suppression of sexual interest in women may, for example, occur in patrilocal societies, where curbing one’s daughter’s sexual activity before her arranged marriage may eventually increase the parents’ reproductive success. Evolutionary hypotheses of female orgasm suggest that the function of orgasm in women could signal satisfaction and fidelity to their male partners. Premature ejaculation in men may relate to performance anxiety. Finally, hormonal contraceptives impact on the experience of sexual pleasure and mate choice in relevant ways.",

      "title": "When Exoneration Seems Hopeless: The Special Vulnerability of Sexual Abuse Suspects to False Confession",
      "abstract": "This chapter considers sources of vulnerability among innocent sexual abuse suspects to police-induced false confession. We suggest that sexual abuse suspects may be particularly vulnerable to false confession, primarily as a result of their enhanced sense of hopelessness that they might be believed or be able to establish their innocence. Moreover, we suggest this sense of hopelessness derives largely from two factors: first, their perception of the evidentiary situation they face; and, second, stereotypes associating fathers, step-fathers, priests, boy scout leaders, day care personnel and others with sexual abuse. That is, we suggest sexual abuse claims are often characterized by (1) seemingly credible claims of one or more victims, (2) against a suspect whose social category is consistent with stereotypes of sexual abusers, (3) lack of concrete physical evidence that could exonerate the suspect, and (4) testimony of professional and nonprofessional witnesses in seeming support of the occurrence of the abuse and/or the suspect’s guilt that likewise cannot be refuted by concrete evidence. Sexual abuse suspects may therefore be less likely than most other innocent suspects to expect (a) that their claims of innocence will be believed in the absence of concrete proof of innocence, (b) that there will be a way to prove their innocence, or even (c) that there will be a way to effectively cast doubt on the validity of the alleged victim(s)’ claims of guilt or other apparently abuse supportive testimony. A primary goal of interrogation tactics is to instill in suspects such a sense of hopelessness, which then makes it easier for the interrogator to convince the suspect that confession will result in better legal outcomes than denial. For many sexual abuse suspects this goal may have been effectively met before they enter interrogation.",

Although the term \"mental retardation\" was in common use in the US for a half century or more, in the early twenty-first century the AAIDD changed the term to \"intellectual disability\".

The patient’s mode of livelihood, living companions, sexual orientation, lifestyle or socioeconomic group may also be relevant factors in selecting medical care. Subspecialty clinics develop around such differences, such as gynecologic surgery for women or pediatric surgery for children’s special problems and unique reactions. Studies also reveal group differences. For example, middle-aged caucasian men are more likely to have coronary artery disease than premenopausal white women. Age can also be predictive to such a degree that people over eighty or under two years of age might be excluded from consideration for some surgeries because they are unlikely to survive the procedure. Race, age, gender, lifestyle choices, sexual orientation, work habits, socioeconomic background, or social background, then, can be legitimate factors in providing medical care generally, and surgical care in particular. Surgeons use this information to help identify patients’ needs and interests. In contrast, such considerations would generally be regarded as un justified in most social institutions.",

As in the case of many disasters, child abuse occurs unexpectedly despite an obvious build-up, as nobody sees anything happening. The perpetrators trigger a cycle of violence which they soon lose control of because no child can resist them. It seems that violence demands still more violence in what is often an endless cycle. The relationship of adults to their child can be perceived in their own speech. Abuse can begin in different ways. The automatic, loveless removal of a child from one family to another bodes no good for the child when the family is just a patchwork of people, organized for utilitarian reasons rather than by affection and love.",

Men may be regarded as having greater authority than women, and the old as having unfair advantages over the young. Scarcity and inequality are also affective phenomena. A powerful chief may be oppressed by his sexual impotence. A husband will be seen to favor one wife over another. A young man will resent the privileged position of his first-born brother. And though the young are enjoined to respect the old, the old are not always deserving of respect.

      "abstract": "The group character of delinquency has been recognized for more than 60 years, but the nature of delinquent groups remains poorly understood. Data from the National Survey of Youth are used to examine delinquent groups, with special attention to the identity and role of instigators in those groups. Delinquent groups are small and transitory, but offenders commonly belong to multiple groups and thus have a larger network or pool of accomplices. Groups appear to be more specialized than individuals, which suggests that offense specialization is the primary source of group differentiation. Most delinquent groups have an identifiable instigator, a person who tends to be older, more experienced, and emotionally close to other members. Males almost always follow other males, whereas females are much more likely to follow a member of the opposite sex. As a rule, offenders do not consistently assume the role of instigator or joiner over time, but instead switch from one role to the other depending on their relative position in the group in which they are participating at the time. The roles that offenders adopt are thus determined, not by some stable individual trait, but by the situational interaction of group and individual characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Although behavioral problems associated with abuse of alcohol emerge during late adolescence and adulthood, some behavioral characteristics indicative of an increased risk of alcoholism may already be obvious during early childhood. Studies in several countries have demonstrated that children with high levels of novelty-seeking behavior and low levels of harm-avoidance behavior are more likely to develop alcohol-related problems during adolescence. Moreover, as early as age 3, children at high risk of future alcoholism because of a family history are more active, more impatient, and more aggressive than matched controls of low-risk children. Causal influences on the initiation of drinking must be distinguished from those that affect patterns of consumption once drinking is initiated. Studies of adolescent twins have demonstrated that initiation of drinking is primarily influenced by the drinking status of parents, siblings, and friends and by socioregional differences in the environments within which adolescent twins reside. The influence of genetic factors is negligible. Conversely, once initiated, differences in frequency and quantity of drinking are strongly influenced by genetic factors. However, these influences, too, are modulated by sibling and peer effects and by regional environmental variation.",

      "title": "Beyond dichotomies: confronting the complexity of how and why individuals come or do not come to mental health care",
      "abstract": "With up to 50% of individuals in the \"developed\" world and up to 85% in the \"developing\" world assessed to have mental health problems but receiving no treatment 1, inevitable questions arise about the reasons for the gap. There are standard explanations – issues of access, cost and manpower; issues of mental health literacy or lack thereof; and of course, the large set of issues of prejudice and discrimination that we call stigma. But the now extensive list of research correlates that have been documented across hundreds of studies have yet to unravel the subtleties that underlie the dilemma of unmet need. Here, a slightly different approach takes some liberties with classic and cutting-edge findings to set a foundation for a holistic, cross-cultural understanding of how person-related and service-related factors come together to influence how individuals respond to the onset of mental health problems. These general principles are writ large, embracing the notion that people, places and professions matter in all times and in all places, even as they play out differently in different societies. At least since the middle of the last century, utilization theories from diverse disciplines developed, placing primacy on different explanations of entry into treatment. Somewhat crudely put, medicine and psychiatry look to etiologically-based practices and professionals; anthropologists and psychologists look to cultural beliefs and individual motivations respectively; and economists and sociologists look to fiscal availability and organizational arrangements of services, including larger structures of inequality that facilitate or hinder access. Over time, disciplinary perspectives have taken each other into account, resulting in a proliferation of revised models, hybrid models, and a nearly endless stream of diagrams or frames that purport to be new theoretical models. Yet, we still do not have a simple and clear answer about unmet need. Perhaps the dichotomous conceptualizations we tend to use in both research and practice stand in the way: either people see a physician or they don't; either people see a psychiatrist or a general practitioner; either it is their beliefs or their lack of insurance that matters; or either people belong to a majority group and think this way or they are part of an ethnic/racial/geographic minority and they do not. The list of paired comparisons is lengthy. What is clear is that the messy realities of confronting the onset of mental health problems in every society challenge traditional ways of thinking. Perhaps each major approach brings a unique wisdom to the understanding of how individuals get, or fail to get, to services. If we are to understand the factors or forces, from local to global, that affect whether individuals with mental health problems end up receiving care, perhaps only a mosaic of the empirically validated, central points of each perspective can fully represent the complexity of the public response to the onset of mental illness 2. Even individuals who end up in the same mental health treatment center are likely to have traveled very different pathways to get there. There are different, but regular and routine, pathways to care, molded to time and place. In the US, for example, just under half of those who had their first major contact with the public mental health system made any kind of decision to do so. Over a quarter ended up in the mental health system through a coercive pathway, whether brought in by social control authorities (e.g., police, jail/prison system, judicial discretion) or seriously pressured by their families. Even more curiously, over a third of individuals reported they \"muddled through\", traveling a pathway that was neither one they designed or was designed for them against their will 4. All societies hold a reservoir of different kinds of lay and professional \"advisors\" that are likely to have been involved in the pathway to care. These \"gateway providers\" 5 determine crucial trajectories that shape outcomes. While we may be comforted by the finding that those who have the most serious mental health problems almost always get to treatment, this should be offset by the early and recent research which reveals that pathways, even for the most severe cases, tend to be lengthy in terms of time and numerous in terms of options sought 6-8. Thus, the implication of these findings is that not all utilization is \"help-seeking\", at least not necessarily by the individual affected; and, pathways are not efficient, even for the most serious cases. Thinking of service use under typical assumptions only interferes with our ability to understand the realities of responding to onset and the challenges of unmet need. The basic meaning of the response onset for individuals may be best captured by Anderson et al's \"containment\" 9, that is, the interpretation of changes in body and mind reflects social and cultural circumstances and experiences that tend to normalize the situation and respond with minimal changes in routines. This is, of course, in some ways a corollary of the first set of findings. Yet, implicit in many theories of health services use is the image of a decision-maker, a rational individual weighing the costs and benefits of seeking care. Some approaches add in the influence of those around them (e.g., as \"norms\") as one more contingency in the calculus. Yet this view clashes with a now substantial body of research that onset, recognition and response are embedded in social networks. Illness behaviors are not just what individuals \"do\" (visit a clinic, pray, take over-the-counter medications, self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, exercise) but include those \"individual consultations\", sometimes wanted, sometimes forced (e.g., employers, teachers, parents), that are activating forces. Social influence plays a big part of what happens in unmet need, by suggestion or substitution. Throwing out or clinging to the idea of \"agency\", that every instance of illness behavior is planned, thought out, and decided, is naïve. Individuals are neither lone, individualistic actors nor are they puppets of others or of the place and times in which they live. As described above, individuals may be proactive, they may go along, or they may resist. And, they may change their stance along the way. But they are always accompanied by what Antonucci 10 calls their \"social convoy\". Whether their social ties to others are extensive or decimated matters, and whether their networks hold informational and emotional resources or not shape use. Again, these findings link and build on each other. If the structure of social networks matter, their counterpart in molding pathways is culture. Local ideas, beliefs, meanings and attitudes are embedded in and transmitted through the set of human ties in everyday life. As Mojtabai 11 recently demonstrated, even the larger, national context of stigma is associated with whether individuals support treatment use or not. Culture also impacts treatment directly. Provider beliefs about what their patients believe turns out to be a poor substitute for specific knowledge that can be gained in the interaction itself. Individuals do not have to ideologically align themselves with one or another tradition of healing, one or another way of thinking about the etiology of mental illness. While providers may hold an ideological stand inculcated through professional training or apprenticeship, individuals do not. They can simultaneously hold beliefs about genetic causation and about \"god's will\" as part of the underlying etiology. These layers of beliefs allow for a practical and flexible response which translates into pathways to care when problems are not resolved. Culture may determine where that pathway starts, an individual's \"cultural toolbox\" may shape next steps, but whether relief is found will determine the pathway's endpoint. Andersen 12, pioneering the role of access, famously noted that even individuals who hold the right beliefs and have great need can only use services if those can be acted upon because of geographical and financial availability. But again, findings do not line up with simple expectation. Figure 1 shows data from 15 countries in our Stigma in Global Context Study 13, a theoretically and methodologically-synced, nationally representative study of public understanding and response to mental illness. When asked the open-ended question, \"What should [name] do, if anything?\", immediately after being read a case scenario of a person meeting DSM/ICD criteria for schizophrenia, there is little correspondence between availability of psychiatrists and the spontaneous mention of this option. Individuals in some countries with a moderate number of psychiatrists per capita (e.g., Great Britain) do not mention psychiatry, while many who have little hope of ever seeing a psychiatrist (e.g., Bangladesh) do. Of course, these findings are curious and bear more analysis and interpretation than possible here. The point here is, again, to show that what we \"know\" and what \"we think we know\" can be two different things, requiring us to recast our ideas given the wealth of data and a new era of science. Mental illness lies in the area of complex diseases. How the public understands and reacts, and how that is linked to their illness behavior, represents a complex response. In the end, the public only seeks to be better – better than before the severe symptoms of many mental health problems diminished their well-being and, for many, created a critical turning point in their life trajectory. If, like other areas of science, we are poised at a new era of understanding which demands that our research embrace delays, missteps and pathways, our models and findings may provide a more useful foundation for improvements in clinical and community practices. If we assume complexity – that large interacting systems shape what people, including providers, do – we will synthesize rather than separate; ask rather than assume; and conceptualize messy reality rather than strive for false parsimony.",

What is at stake is brought out by considering certain objections to father‐daughter incest and certain features of taboos. The objections that matter do not depend on social ties and distinctions having a biological basis, but there is nonetheless a biological element in incest taboos. To see it, one must look to the nature of the Oedipus complex, and to the conditions for the development of the individual and of society. There may be prohibitions which are necessary (to morality, to society, to humanity) even though they may not be justifiable within a narrower conception (e.g. utilitarian) of morality and justification. And so taboos which are universal (occur, in one form or another, in every society), and absolute (allow no questioning), and impose strict liability (allow no excuse), may not be irrational: they may mark the boundaries that shape a way of life.",

      "title": "Hair pulling (trichotillomania).",
      "abstract": "Based on the findings in this case and common elements reported in other articles on trichotillomania, there seems to be evidence that the \"irresistible urge\" to pull out the hair has its beginnings in the early years of a child's life. The nature of the parent-child relationships appears to be especially important in establishing psychological antecedents for the later development of trichotillomania. Specifically, the trichotillomanic's mother sets the stage for the emergence of this symptom by extending the child's dependence upon her as the primary need-gratifier beyond early childhood into latency, adolescence, and adulthood. As a result the child is not gradually propelled to participate in newer and more complex learning experiences that ultimately lead to a sense of mastery and independent functioning in the environment. Important developmental stimuli are not presented at the appropriate times and the child is not exposed to certain types of interactions at the optimal times so that some very important ego functions do not develop, or develop minimally, or in a distorted manner. Simply, the mother cannot \"let go\" of her child, apparently deriving gratification of her own needs through infantilization of the child; as a result the child develops a limited or illusory sense of self sufficiency. Continuation of such an unhealthy symbiotic relationship, however, is found in many forms of psychopathology and the fact that it also underlies trichotillomania may partially account for hair pulling as a symptom associated with such a wide range of nosological categories. It is the main contention of this study, however, that the quality of the parent-child relationships impairs the ego development and causes failure of the trichotillomanic patient to establish object constancy. Without the establishment of object constancy an individual requires visible evidence that the object/person capable of gratifying basic security needs is present or available. In trichotillomania the hair seems to symbolize the need-gratifying object/person who is lost when the hair is pulled out and, more importantly, regained when it is eaten or restored. It appears to be this latter component of trichotillomania, i.e., reincorporation of the need-gratifying object/person, which reassures the patient that infantile needs can be gratified and security can be reestablished. Unfortunately, the trichotillomanic is driven to repeatedly and compulsively remove hair so that it can be regained temporarily since object constancy is never really established.",

There are some constitutional patterns which particularly lend themselves to the more openly aggressive forms of interactive and impulsive individuals. There are environmental shaping forces which can be major influences such as being reared in a setting where violence between people is commonplace. Group pressures and influences can be later determinants. There are specific developmental stages, particularly between two and four years of age when there is active interest in and experimentation with sadistic and other violent forms of interaction and expression.

This manifestation of antisocial behavior can be attributed to one or more of the following:•The relative anonymity of those who use the net•The lack of regulation in cyberspace•The fact that one can masquerade as another on the Internet•The fact that one can fulfill a fantasy or assume a different persona on the net, thereby eliminating the social obligation to be accountable for one's own actionsWhatever the reason, the Internet, also known as the \"wild west\" or the \"untamed frontier,\" is absent of law and therefore is a natural playground for illicit, illegal, and unethical behavior.",

      "abstract": "After reaching old age, the elderly most often withdraw from social life. This is a serious problem because by isolating themselves from society they become less active. This has an impact on the emergence of many diseases related to both old age and the impact of physical inactivity on the body. The aim of the study was to present the consequences of the aging process in various aspects of the body’s functioning and the role of physical activity in eliminating these consequences. Unfortunately, there are still too few activities focused on physical activity for people over 65. This should change, because physical activity has a very positive effect on the human body and its well-being. Additionally, it can be observed that the earlier physical activity is started, the less changes in the body associated with the progressive aging process will occur. Such a person will be more agile and will not have major problems in dealing with overcoming the difficulties of everyday life.",

School failure does not qualify as a disease, a syndrome, or a unique pathogenetic process. It is rather the product of constitutional predispositions that have interacted with environmental factors and life events in an ongoing process. Intrinsic handicaps may be subtle. Their outward manifestations are likely to vary from child to child and evolve with age, shaped by neurologic maturation, experience, and changing external expectations.Children with school problems form a heterogeneous group with diverse etiologies, symptom complexes, diagnostic findings and service needs. Nine common precursors of school failure are suggested in this review.

      "abstract": "Nearly half of U.S. high school students (9th-12th graders) have had sexual intercourse and over 60 percent report having had sex by the time they graduate. This demonstrates that many adolescents are confronted at some point during their teen years with choices about whether or not to have sex and if they do whether or not to use condoms and/or other contraceptives. Many factors affect those choices. Parents educators and other adults working with youth have learned that they cannot directly control the sexual behavior of teens. While parents might wish to monitor their sons or daughters 24 hours a day to prevent them from having sex or at the very least unprotected sex they cannot do this. Instead parents and others concerned about youth can only try to affect those factors that in turn affect the sexual decision-making of young people. For example they might try to affect factors such as the teens values about sexual behavior their perceptions of family values and peer norms about sex their attitudes about condoms and other forms of contraception their educational and career plans or their connection to their parents their schools and their faith communities all of which are likely to affect whether or not teens have sex and whether or not they use protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease (STD). Understanding important factors related to sexual behavior is important not only to change that behavior; it is important to identify those teens who are most at risk of having sex and unprotected sex. First people can use these factors to identify those teens at greater risk; then they can address the important factors affecting their behavior. This report identifies many of these factors and explains their implications for those working to help youth avoid risky sexual behaviors and potential consequences. (excerpt)",

      "abstract": "A surprising number of men report a lack of sexual desire, with conservative estimates ranging between 15 and 25% of adult males. Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one’s partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one’s sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

Trust appears to be a critical precondition for success in most human endeavours involving more than one person. Trust can typically appear as a social construct or a psychological belief and may often touch on ethical, personal or organisational values. The issue of trust evokes deeply held practical as well as philosophical contradictions and paradoxes. The implication of the paradox is that trust requires a leap of faith that obliges one side to give the benefit of the doubt to a relatively unknown and 'unproven' person. In order to build stronger relationships and achieve through greater partnerships and alliances, one must embrace new and untested opportunities, thereby exposing oneself to potentially fresh vulnerabilities. Effort is not proportional to achievement; instead it depends on the stage of the relationship.",

      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim’s prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim’s sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim’s physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman’s thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. The same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception—women who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

Families may be reluctant to address the ability to drive safely because of fear of confrontation and their own grieving at the loss it symbolizes.

Many negative attitudes have been held traditionally relating to the sexual behaviour of older people, and this may account for the reluctance of many elderly clients to seek help, and for the lack of attention paid by helping professionals. The number of referrals for sex therapy from older persons is now beginning to increase, and evidence confirms that the majority of healthy older persons remain sexually active and sexually capable throughout their later years. Although there is a marked lack of empirical research, case studies suggest that cognitive-behavioural approaches offer promise in the treatment of psychosexual dysfunction in the elderly. Factors are discussed that relate specifically to older clients in the application of a cognitive-behavioural approach to assessment and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Violence is nothing more than the intentional use of physical force by people with the aim of causing harm to other living beings or to material goods that manifests itself through injury, pain, disability, damage, death. The World Health Organization shows that violence is \"the intentional use of physical force or power - threatened or actual - against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in physical harm, death, psychological suffering, impaired development or deprivation\" (World Health Organization, 2015). It follows from this definition that violence is not limited to obvious physical aggression. It includes subtle and systemic forms of exercising power. Violence causes psychological trauma, economic inequality and/or social marginalization. Intention is the essential element, the fundamental distinction between an act of violence and an accidental event lies in the will or conscious acceptance of the risk that harm may be caused. Even in the absence of immediate bodily harm, violence has serious consequences, lasting consequences on physical, mental and social health (Krug et al., 2002).",

      "abstract": "Handicap is a generic concept which can comprise heterogeneous groups of people. Any international comparison reveals itself to be an arduous task.  In fact the groups of people concerned are not the same everywhere and practices vary according to this specific cultural, social and economic backgrounds. Public policies depend on the different representations of the notion of handicap and are influenced by both disabled people themselves as well as by policy makers as well.  For example in France from the early 1960s the word « handicap » was progressively replaced  by other nouns such as “infirme” (disabled) or “inadapte” (usted, malad). The shift in meaning of the word “handicape” seems to be related to the distressing ordeals experienced by some, which have led to somatic and mental weaknesses and to the idea that ways can be found to compensate for handicaps and allowing ways to live as an able-bodied person. Beyond the widely spread social norms and behaviour , the handicapped person faces constraining representations almost stereotypical which a lead to the sense of enclosure. Being born triggers or handicapped generates a whole set of psychic disorders provoking an inner and collective moral suffering. The human body can be considered as the prevailing pillar of identity for both handicapped and valid people.  A two-fold psychological mechanism seems to be at the root of the handicapped person’s self-acceptance and his/her relationships to others and to social groups.  Through a mechanism of objectification the subject rediscovers his/her own and full identity within the world of able-bodied persons. Through the mechanism of appropriation the handicapped person accepts his/her self-experienced own image as he experienced it.  The construction of this new identity is internally nurtured and is strengthened by the close personal interactions which certainly contribute playing an important role in the development of our identity. The process is firstly generated among family members and then it is progressively encouraged more widely encouraged by social relations. In this perspective sport will fully impact the process.  Beyond too widely and hurriedly accepted evidences it is highly recommend one should disregard preconception we might have, even those barred or so-called evidence and be prepared to change our area of focus to define the ideal approach.  The main goal was to try to understand why and how sport activities can help to generate a transformation of self and social perception of our identity. The report presents the results of a survey, which was conducted in 2011 by the « Pole Ressources National Sport et Handicaps » addressed to 1600 Clubs and 16000 Athletes indicate that a large number of clubs are really involved in the procedure of welcoming and confirms the positive impact of physical activity in order to reclaim a normal social image despite number of personal obstacles and considerable number of people with disabilities live in residential institutions. The survey shows also that clubs adapt their structures and procedures to facilitate the inclusion of people with disabilities, rather than expecting them to change to fit in with existing arrangements.",

Sociology has made a major but largely behind the scenes contribution to addiction research, often fronted by sympathetic clinicians. There is a substantial body of sociological and psychological theory on how people construct, perceive and manage risk, mostly not considering addiction. Sociological understandings have made an important but under-appreciated contribution to research on and interventions for addiction.

      "abstract": "To speak of youth implies that these individuals have something in common, that they share certain experiences and preoccupations. Yet everyone has his or her own particular ideas about the meaning of youth or adolescence; one can also distinguish various approaches to apprehending this concept. For example, adolescence can be defined in physiological or biological terms when one refers to puberty. From a sociological or economic point of view, one might define youth as a key period for the construction of a stable identity or as a stage of transition from school to work. Thus, to speak of youth is actually a way of classifying or evaluating individuals. For some, young people are a source of innovation; for others, they form a group with its own set of values and its own culture that sometimes disturbs by its behavior. There are different types of discourse about youth, and each focuses on particular categories of behavior and social phenomena.",

That is not to say that children and adults do not engage in similar behaviors; however, such behaviors are more numerous and extreme during adolescence. This may be one of the reasons why during adolescence young people are at a much greater risk of injury or death as a result of placing themselves in harm's way. It is also during adolescence that behaviors associated with experimentation (i.e., illicit drug use, alcohol consumption, and unprotected sex) can lead to aversive outcomes, largely as a consequence of preventable risk taking. Interestingly, there appears to be a neurobiological link to adolescent risk taking and impulsivity, which when considered offers a framework for understanding and engaging adolescents that goes beyond culture and context.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is not only an individual health issue but also a public health issue. While sexual abuse is a physical and psychological health issue for an individual, with multiple and varied repercussions, it also involves aspects of the earliest bonds, the bonds of attachment, since it usually takes place within the family circle. In light of three clinical case studies, the article discusses the concept of destructiveness both generally and specifically in situations of sexual abuse, in order to propose some key points concerning the child’s speech during treatment. It should be pointed out that the child, whether or not he or she confides in the clinician, is often psycho-traumatized. Destructiveness relates to the destructive nature of a living or non-living element and, more generally, to the ability to destroy. In connection with this notion, we can generally observe so-called gravity factors and other so-called protective factors, which are likely to coexist. If the former are more substantial, there is a high probability that the symptoms will be debilitating and long-lasting, and we note that they may worsen over time or appear in a delayed manner. If the protective factors are substantial, then the child is more likely to experience mild trauma and more or less rapid healing.",

      "abstract": "Social determinants of mental health in the industrialised world and in post-colonial societies are found to be directly related to intersectional vulnerabilities of class, caste/race/ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, language, education and geographical location. The chapter highlights the role of family and kinship networks that determine gender norms and socialisation patterns including the role of school, community and societal practices such as gender-based violence in personal and public life, restriction of career choices by parents and after marriage by the husband and in-laws, sexual harassment at workplace, customs and traditions that degrade human beings and make them feel unwanted, children pressurised to perform beyond their willingness and abilities, dehumanising sex stereotypes that promote son preference, aversion to daughters and stigmatisations of the sexual minorities/transgender persons, educated women not allowed self-actualisation by pursuit of knowledge face mental health problems manifesting in depression, loss of interest in life, feeling of hopelessness, suicidal tendency etc. It also covers the issues of populations with intersectional vulnerabilities such as Dalits, ethnic-religious-sexual minorities, survivors of sexual violence, persons with disabilities, poor and unemployed facing discrimination, dehumanisation and exclusion from social spaces that result in acute mental health challenges. The uniqueness of this chapter lies in its extensive mapping of the successful initiative of Women's Grievance Redressal Cells (WGRC), a project by Mohalla Committee Movement, Mumbai. The chapter also makes eclectic suggestions including micro, mezzo and macro interventions to enable respect for gender diversity and plurality in order to ensure inclusive family and community-based structures that promote and ensure overall mental well-being. It thrusts on creation of systems and structures that promote intersection justice through gender inclusive mental health legislations and rules, data driven and evidence-based policy, affirmative action backed by adequate funds, clearly defined functions and competent and empathetic functionaries.",

Developmentally normal children possess an inherent biological drive for sucking, the explanation for which can be found in both psychoanalytic and learning theory. Psychoanalytic theory contends that non-nutritive sucking represents a biological drive resulting from pleasurable stimulation of the lips and mouth; learning theory proposes that the infant learns to associate sucking with pleasurable feelings such as satiety or being held. Whatever the theoretical basis, thumbsucking generally is viewed as a biological drive that develops into a habit, which in the majority of cases resolves by age 4 years, but can persist much longer.",

      "abstract": "Despite the well-recognised benefits of sport, there are also negative influences on athlete health, well-being and integrity caused by non-accidental violence through harassment and abuse. All athletes have a right to engage in ‘safe sport’, defined as an athletic environment that is respectful, equitable and free from all forms of non-accidental violence to athletes. Yet, these issues represent a blind spot for many sport organisations through fear of reputational damage, ignorance, silence or collusion. This consensus statement extends the 2007 IOC Consensus Statement on Sexual Harassment and Abuse in Sport, presenting additional evidence of several other types of harassment and abuse—psychological, physical and neglect. All ages and types of athletes are susceptible to these problems but science confirms that elite, disabled, child and lesbian/gay/bisexual/trans-sexual (LGBT) athletes are at highest risk, that psychological abuse is at the core of all other forms and that athletes can also be perpetrators. Harassment and abuse arise from prejudices expressed through power differences. Perpetrators use a range of interpersonal mechanisms including contact, non-contact/verbal, cyber-based, negligence, bullying and hazing. Attention is paid to the particular risks facing child athletes, athletes with a disability and LGBT athletes. Impacts on the individual athlete and the organisation are discussed. Sport stakeholders are encouraged to consider the wider social parameters of these issues, including cultures of secrecy and deference that too often facilitate abuse, rather than focusing simply on psychopathological causes. The promotion of safe sport is an urgent task and part of the broader international imperative for good governance in sport. A systematic multiagency approach to prevention is most effective, involving athletes, entourage members, sport managers, medical and therapeutic practitioners, educators and criminal justice agencies. Structural and cultural remedies, as well as practical recommendations, are suggested for sport organisations, athletes, sports medicine and allied disciplines, sport scientists and researchers. The successful prevention and eradication of abuse and harassment against athletes rests on the effectiveness of leadership by the major international and national sport organisations.",

In many cases sexual communication is improved because of contraception; in many cases it has a negative influence, caused mainly by the mental immaturity of the partners, by their emotional instability, or by their sociocultural background. Negative sexual side effects of contraception are usually caused, in the woman, by a conflict with the traditional image of the woman as mother, and by an unconscious desire of fertility; in the man they are usually caused by the long-accepted identification of sexual potency with reproductive ability, and by fears for the newly acquired freedom of the female partner. Positive or negative psychological effects of contraception vary, but not greatly, according to the method used. A sympathetic and experienced doctor can furnish good advice on the matter.",

The concept of vulnerability reflects the fact that we all are born, live, and die within a fragile materiality that renders all of us constantly susceptible to destructive external forces and internal disintegration. Vulnerability should not be equated with harm any more than age inevitably means loss of capacity. Properly understood, vulnerability is generative and presents opportunities for innovation and growth, as well as creativity and fulfillment. Human beings are vulnerable because as embodied and vulnerable beings, we experience feelings such as love, respect, curiosity, amusement, and desire that make us reach out to others, form relationships, and build institutions. Both the negative and the positive possibilities inherent in vulnerability recognize the inescapable interrelationship and interdependence that mark human existence.",

It symbolizes self-control, hard work, ambition, and success in life. Inherent in this symbolism is the concept that the individual controls behavior, which in turn controls health. Although control over one's life plays an important role in both physical and mental health, the concept of personal control also infers responsibility. Positive attributes are accorded to people who are healthy, but those who fall ill, or those with less than the perfect body, are blamed and are thought to be self-indulgent, lazy, or even irresponsible and immoral. There is a tendency to overstate the impact of personal behavior on health. However, biological realities shape the degree to which health is under the control of the individual. The positive effects of behavior change must be balanced with the limits imposed by biology.",

      "abstract": "Sexual addiction, which is also known as hypersexual disorder, has largely been ignored by psychiatrists, even though the condition causes serious psychosocial problems for many people. A lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, people who were categorized as having a compulsive, impulsive, addictive sexual disorder or a hypersexual disorder reported having obsessive thoughts and behaviors as well as sexual fantasies. Existing prevalence rates of sexual addiction-related disorders range from 3% to 6%. Sexual addiction/ hypersexual disorder is used as an umbrella construct to encompass various types of problematic behaviors, including excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, sexual behavior with consenting adults, telephone sex, strip club visitation, and other behaviors. The adverse consequences of sexual addiction are similar to the consequences of other addictive disorders. Addictive, somatic and psychiatric disorders coexist with sexual addiction. In recent years, research on sexual addiction has proliferated, and screening instruments have increasingly been developed to diagnose or quantify sexual addiction disorders. In our systematic review of the existing measures, 22 questionnaires were identified. As with other behavioral addictions, the appropriate treatment of sexual addiction should combine pharmacological and psychological approaches. Psychiatric and somatic comorbidities that frequently occur with sexual addiction should be integrated into the therapeutic process. Group-based treatments should also be attempted.

Although this disorder is defined by numerous of forms, classification on healthy and pathological narcissism is significant in so far as it clarifies that it is healthy narcissism to some extent desirable in order to achieve healthy ambitions and goals in life. In moderation is present in each of us and necessary to successfully gone through the process of self realization. Pathological narcissism can also lead to social success but person is usually unable to achieve healthy interpersonal relationships and is often in disharmony with the environment. Narcissistic personality disorder as a complex problem can in certain cases be considered as an advantage if big ambitions, diligence and outstanding confidence resulted in a marked progression on the social ladder. Often such people are becoming high-ranking and accepted in social circles. Despite the advantages that through this disorder can sometimes present, shortcomings are reflected as distinct detachment from the environment, the impossibility of establishing a healthy and lasting relationships. Narcissists are emotionally unavailable, unable to achieve stable love relationships. In case of more conspicuous pathology, problems may exist at the level of socially accepted norms, moral and law so the damage can affect the broader framework of society.",

      "abstract": "Children begin to manage their reputation around school-age, but it remains unclear when they start to explicitly reason about reputational strategies such as lying from a third-person perspective. The current study investigated whether 5- and 7-year-old children would explicitly predict reputational lying in the context of a third party interaction. Participants were told hypothetical stories and asked to predict whether a protagonist would lie to a peer character about a selfish resource allocation. Results revealed that about half of the 7-year-olds and neglectable few of the 5-year-olds began to predict that the protagonist would lie to his peer out of reputational concern and whitewash the selfishly distributed amount. The prediction of reputational lying did not differ for ingroup or outgroup third parties. Seven-year-olds justified their prediction of a lie with reference to how the protagonist would look to others. While reputational lying has been shown in 5-year-olds in comparable interactive scenarios with peers, a more abstract, explicit understanding of reputational lying seems to be a more complex cognitive ability, emerging around the age of 7 years.",

      "title": "Stress Mediates the Health Effects of Many Social Determinants",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines current scientific knowledge of how stress influences health and health disparities. Stress (the experience of feeling “stressed” or “stressed out”) is distinguished from a stressor (an event or condition that causes stress) and from the stress response (the body’s physiologic response to stress). Advances in neuroscience indicate that stress is likely to be an important link between many social factors and many health outcomes. Chronic exposure to multiple everyday hardships (especially conditions over which one has little control) is likely to be more damaging to health than dramatic acute stressors. “Bad” (“toxic”) stress is stress that overwhelms one’s ability to cope, causing adverse cognitive, behavioral, and/or physiological effects. The links between social disadvantage (e.g., poverty and discrimination) and stress are explored in this chapter. For example, having chronically inadequate economic resources to cope with basic everyday needs—such as food, shelter, child care, elder care, or medical care—is likely to be stressful, as is experiencing ongoing discrimination (unfair treatment based on attributes such as race/ethnic group, skin color, religion, gender, disability, or LGBTQ status). Social support appears to protect to some extent against the health-damaging effects of stress. Strategies to reduce stress, particularly that due to social disadvantage, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In several nations, children with incapacities are often destitute of their freedom, detached from family atmospheres, and restricted to institutes or sealed away in so-called health-care amenities in the term of maintenance and treatment. The motives for this separation fluctuate: disgrace, deficiency of cognizance, and a scarcity of sustenance amenities for children and their families all perform a character. Inside organizations in numerous nations, Human Rights Watch has recognized that children with disabilities frequently face solemn abandonment and exploitation, including thrashings and mental fierceness, erotic fierceness, unintentional and unsuitable remedial action, use of offensive bodily manacles, concealment, and drowsiness, renunciation of schooling and repudiation of steady acquaintances with families. These exploitations can harshly hinder their corporeal, academic, expressive, and societal expansion, and these detrimental effects are not restricted to circumstances in which the vilest exploitations take dwelling. The worldwide examination has revealed that children progress best with durable and helpful associations in a harmless and encouraging family-like atmosphere. Children with disabilities are permitted to fortification from fierceness, abandonment, mistreatment, and mishandling, and have the right to be concerned for by their parents or within family-like surroundings. Ferocity and negligence toward children existing in organizations should finish and governments should advance effective and manageable civil amenities, counting well-being maintenance, child maintenance provision, comprehensive schooling. When governments capitalize on community-based amenities and sustenance, children with disabilities can animate with their families and be a part of their societies instead of behind inaccessible exits.",

Participants were more likely to disclose to mothers than fathers, usually around age 19 years and in a face-to-face encounter. Mothers were told before fathers, largely because mothers asked or because youth wanted to share their life with them; fathers were told by someone other than their child or by the youth because it was time. The reason participants did not disclose to mothers was because it was not the right developmental time; the reason they did not disclose to fathers was because they were not close to them. Sons, more than daughters, feared the negative reactions of parents, who generally reacted in the same manner--supportive or slightly negative. Relationships with parents since disclosure generally had not changed or had improved. Sex of parent mattered more than sex of child on most domains.",

      "abstract": "Although thought to be trivial, microaggressions have severe mental and physical impact on the individuals of the targeted groups or populations. The fact that this form of discrimination is mostly hidden, common and hard to identify makes it extremely difficult for the victims to protect themselves or respond appropriately to its occurrences. Microaggressions are covert discriminatory verbal, visual, or societal/individual attitudes embedded in everyday life communications whether intentional or unintentional against a person or a group based on religious, ethnic or gender affiliations. Microaggressions degrade, marginalize, and alienate the target group or person causing significant mental and physical harm to the victim. Microaggressions have three types: micro assault, microinsult, and micro-invalidation. The continuous exposure to these aggressive acts increases the risk for serious mental disorders with increased need for psychiatric care. At many societies, Muslim are a main target for microaggressions that is specifically intensified with the propagation of Islamophobia. Mental health professionals have to ensure culture sensitive care by first and far most face their own biases and the societal influences on their practices, believes and ethics. Literature review of online data and research was conducted. Three books directly related to the subject were reviewed. The main objectives were to understand the forms of racial/religion discrimination impeded in society targeting Muslim, the psychological impact of microaggressions, biases in psychiatric care, and ways to help this particular group. Healthcare systems and mental health providers are not immune from engaging in microaggressions. They are required to understand these patterns of insults as it will cause farther confusion to their patients and increase resentment and mistrust to the care they provide to this group.",

      "abstract": "Surveys and controlled studies have indicated that personal identity conflicts, sleep deprivation, and financial difficulties are three prominent stresses that residents face. Failure to adapt results in decreased performance, increased marital discord, and substance abuse. A sense of identity comes primarily from inner feelings, but one's education and how one is viewed by society are perhaps equally important. When interns begin their year, they frequently identify themselves as “healers” who will significantly help their fellow man. In return, they expect to be treated with respect and to take home a healthy income. It is not long into their internship when the reality of long hours, the deprivations of meager income, and the nuisances of demanding patients and attending physicians imprint a mental image at odds with their expectations. Confusion followed by decreased performance appears to be the first effect of this awakening. Depression, marital difficulty, and substance abuse soon follow. Resolution of identity conflicts may not take place until late in the residency as the individual struggles with various and often conflicting roles (physician, student, employee, faculty, parent, spouse). Maturation might occur more readily if residency programs focused both on aiding the resident's coping mechanisms and on decreasing environmental stress. The availability of faculty advisors, counselors, and retreats addresses the former. Of more recent interest, and likely more effective, are efforts towards reducing work loads, providing quieter and more private call rooms, increasing salaries, and improving benefits.",

      "title": "Actions that protect: Promoting sexual and reproductive health and choice among young people in India",
      "abstract": "This paper synthesises the evidence on the sexual and reproductive health situation of young people in India, and explores what we know about underlying factors that place them at risk of or protect them from unsafe and unwanted sexual and reproductive health experiences. The picture that emerges suggests that substantial proportions of young people experience risky or unwanted sexual activity, do not receive prompt or appropriate care, and experience adverse reproductive health outcomes. Contextual factors such as poverty, gender imbalances and lack of education or livelihood opportunities clearly increase the vulnerability of youth. Other factors at the family, community and facility level may also exacerbate risk. While young people’s knowledge and awareness about sexual and reproductive health is increasing, much of this knowledge remains superficial and ridden with myths, misperceptions and a sense of invulnerability. Gender power imbalances make risky behaviours acceptable, encourage secrecy and fear of disclosure, and inhibit negotiation among partners. Lack of communication with parents and other trusted adults, similarly, keeps young people ill informed and unlikely to receive parental support or counsel in relation to sexual matters. Sexuality education remains inadequate and irrelevant to young people’s needs, and services remain inaccessible, unacceptable, unaffordable and of indifferent quality. Several encouraging signs are, however, evident. The sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents and young people are on the national agenda. There is growing recognition that young people themselves must be given a role in articulating, designing, implementing and evaluating such programmes. Finally, experiences of a few programmes already exist that appear to successfully respond to young people’s sexual and reproductive health needs in innovative and acceptable ways. The paper concludes by recommending, on the basis of available evidence, a core set of promising actions that protect.",

      "abstract": "A bstract : This study involved a sub‐group of a panel of community volunteers—37 long‐lived persons (20 men, 17 women) and 37 short‐lived persons (20 men, 17 women). The findings suggest that group characteristics of long‐term survivors differ sharply from those of short‐term survivors in old age. Moreover, it seems that there is no single factor which contributes to longevity; rather, there is a constellation of biological, psychological, and social factors amounting to what may be best described as elite ***status. Persons with high intelligence, sound financial status, well‐maintained health, and intact marriages may be expected to live significantly longer than their less intelligent and poorer brothers and sisters whose health is also declining and whose marriages are no longer intact. Many of the factors identified here as contributing to longevity are not readily subject to individual, social, or political manipulation, with the possible exception of financial factors. It is hoped that investigations in other parts of the country and with differing populations of elderly people can determine if the hypotheses put forward here apply to elderly persons generally. It would also be interesting to know if these factors are similarly important in influencing survival at other stages of the life cycle. Infant mortality in this country certainly seems to be related to some of the factors examined in this study.",

      "title": "Psychosocial Dimensions of Family Violence",
      "abstract": "The common dictionary definition of violence states that this term encompasses the exertion of physical force so as to injure or abuse someone else. The inclusion of “abuse” in the definition is important, because it opens up the issues of force being used to induce negative psychological states and to violate basic human dignity and rights. One type of violence that has received increased attention in recent years is family violence, a deviant or delinquent behavior for which statistics are difficult to compile because it is so heavily underreported. The issue of family violence is an important area of public, political, and academic concern that goes to the heart of the institution of the family and marriage. At the individual level, it involves personal negative attitudes and aggressive behaviors as well as physical and emotional prejudices. There are a number of well-documented predictive factors of family violence, most of them psychological. Several forms of the family violencebased victimization have been described. Direct (as victim) or indirect (as eyewitness) exposure to family violence can have a significant psychological impact on children and adults during their development. For example, infants, school-age children and adolescents who witness violence in their homes are more vulnerable to excessive irritability, immature behaviors, sleep disturbances, emotional distress, fears of being alone, and developmental regression. This paper briefly analyses the causes, types and consequences of family violence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This book discusses cases where it’s unclear whether a person’s consent to sex should count as valid consent, the kind of consent that makes it permissible for the person they give consent to to have sex with them. Clear cases of coercion, for example, involve the threat of significant physical harm. But what should we say about cases involving the threat of harms that are relatively insignificant or that involve no physical harm at all? Impersonating someone’s spouse to trick them into saying yes to sex is clearly seriously wrong, but what about the more mundane kinds of lies people tell when they’re trying to meet someone? It’s wrong to have sex with someone who says yes when they’re so drunk they’re about to pass out and not wrong if they say yes after having a few sips of beer. What, though, should we say about the more difficult cases in the middle where it’s genuinely unclear whether they’ve had too much to drink? What’s the most reasonable view about other forms of incompetent consent to sex, like those involving young children, elderly dementia patients, or people born with severe and permanent cognitive impairments? And what about cases of problematic sexual consent that don’t involve coercion, deception, or incompetence at all? Can a patient give valid consent to sex with their therapist? Can the offer of a large amount of money in exchange for sex invalidate the sexual consent the offer elicits? This book addresses these and related questions.",

      "title": "Life Satisfaction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Life satisfaction (LS) is the major component of subjective wellbeing (SWB) and is often referred to as cognitive wellbeing. LS can be defined as a comparison between a person’s ideal life and their actual life, but it can also be defined as a broad appraisal that a person makes of their life as a whole. Both conceptualizations have their weaknesses. The first overestimates humans’ computational capacities and is unable to account for how comparisons are performed mentally. The second is underspecified and does not provide enough detail about the judgmental mechanisms involved in the subjective evaluation of the favorability of one’s life. Despite these limitations, measures of LS are reliable and provide vital information about people’s quality of life. LS items are also stable predictors of a bundle of outcome variables at both the individual and societal levels, such as health, longevity, motivation, investments, and political elections. The humanistic theory of wellbeing (HTW) argues, however, that self-reports of LS are not valid in the sense of measuring what they intend to measure. Self-reported LS does not reflect an unbiased, reflective, and broad report of all the important appraisals individuals make about the quality of their lives. The SWB literature holds LS to represent cognitive wellbeing, even though empirical evidence shows that the concept comprises strong affective cues. The HTW therefore claims that LS is similar to pleasure and other harmony feelings in that it reflects spontaneous good–bad evaluations and that the concept functionally operates to maintain universal needs for stability. But LS is not a feeling state. The cognitive attributes of LS have been specified by Diener as following a three-step procedure. The first is an examination of the conditions in one’s life, the second is a weighting of the importance of these conditions, and the third is an aggregated evaluation of the weighted conditions on a quantified scale running from dissatisfied to satisfied [Diener, E. (2009). Assessing well-being: The collected works of Ed Diene r. Springer. (p. 196)]. However, survey participants only spend a few seconds responding to an LS item, which is not consistent with such a complex and time-consuming process. The workload required to calculate one’s life satisfaction according to a set of computation rules is too large for the human brain to carry out. Therefore, the HTW accuses the default version of SWB to fall for an “all things considered” myth. Rather than considering LS as an overall and reflective evaluation carried out as a System 2 process, the HTW suggests that self-reported LS is determined as a System 1 response. A System 1 approach is more consistent with the idea that affective and cognitive elements interact in forming the concept of LS. Another disagreement between mainstream SWB theory and the HTW relates to the functions of LS. Most SWB researchers consider states of high life satisfaction to be approach oriented and concerned with “doing” things. The alternative perspective is that high life satisfaction reflects a mode of “having” rather than “doing.” Since the HTW associates LS with the regulation of stability, it supports the latter view. However, the “having” and “doing” elements of LS are complex. For example, measures of LS correlate with a broad specter of active lifestyles, which speaks against the “having” hypothesis. The last section of this chapter discusses how LS relates to values. An important hypothesis offered by the HTW is that LS is biased toward values that are “spontaneous” and come easily to mind. Accordingly, reflective values tend to escape the evaluative space of an LS judgment. LS should for example be sensitive to gaps between what we want to accomplish and what we actually have accomplished. But empirical studies suggest that only gaps in “spontaneous” values have an impact on LS, while gaps related to “reflective” values leave LS unaffected.",

      "abstract": "Although in recent years considerable attention has been given to the study of parents as significant contributors to child behavior patterns and tendencies (3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16), there has been little evident awareness of experimenters as adult interactors varying in attributes or behaviors that may affect responses elicited from children. Whereas variations in parental attitudes and behaviors are often hypothesized as critical antecedents, experimenters seem to be regarded as generalized adult figures, impersonal behavior initiators, and data recording machines. If the child is indeed responsive to such qualities in his parents as warmth, permissiveness or restriction, sex roles, etc., then he should build up certain expectations and anticipatory sets associated with the occurrence of such qualities in other significant adults. Yet studies designed to manipulate child behavior have generally failed to consider or control for relevant experimenter characteristics. Some attention has been directed to the presence or absence of adults as a factor affecting child behavior (14), but the effects of E attributes or behaviors have been largely neglected. One of the more obvious, readily defined E attributes that might be considered to influence a child's responses is sex status. Interactions with male versus female experimenters may be expected to involve some differences in response sets of the experimental children. A few recent studies have varied sex of E as part of the experimental design. Gewirtz and his colleagues (6) in two studies of attention seeking with variation of adult",

      "abstract": "In the course of investigations related to a penal prosecution in Italy, biological material obtained from individuals considered directly involved in a crime, but neither suspected nor prosecuted, may be acquired without their knowledge and/or consent. Although scientific progress constantly provides greater potential to forensic investigations, new ethical implications arise from the need to balance the greater efforts towards justice which science allows against the protection of individual human rights. The issue that arises in our case is that a biological sample (and consequently a genetic profile) acquired without the consent and knowledge of the subject might become discrimi natory and stigmatizing for the subjects involved (individuals involved in the life of the victim, but neither suspected of carrying out the crime, nor prosecuted) should the investigative activity enter the public domain. The protection of an individual’s privacy within the context of the investigations goes beyond normal parameters of guarantee, because the risk of placing the identification pr ocess outside the control of the individuals is real. This risk therefore has a social relevance, considering that the investigative process might become discriminating and stigmatizing should the investigation enter the public domain. The safeguarding of privacy rights and the guarantee of society security must not contradict, but rather complement, each other.",

Of these, 23 estrangements were initiated by the participant and 16 were maintained by the participant after being initiated by the parent or occurring after a mutual lessening of contact. Participants reported three core reasons for estrangement: (i) abuse, (ii) poor parenting, and (iii) betrayal. However, estrangement was predominantly situated in long-term perceived or actual disconnection from the parent and family of origin. Most participants had engaged in cycles of estrangement and reunification, using distance to assess the relationship and attend to their own personal development and growth across time. Estrangement was generally triggered by a relatively minor incident or a more serious act of betrayal considered to have been enacted by the parent.",

So that makes most of the wavering marriage currently foundered experiencing divorce. Because many couples fail and do not have the ability to understand the roots of rejection experienced by their partners, or do not really know the dark past the partner can also be due to the lack of openness from the couple related to the past in the family of each partner. Negative effects will be seen after a few months or a few years in marriage then comes the original negative nature that causes anger and hatred towards the couple. The problem is not only that the impact of refusal can lead to sexual immorality or live in uncleanness in the household and even many infidelities occur because of dissatisfaction from each partner. The point in building a partner's household is not to be blind to see and pay attention to their partner enough just to fall in love to see the appearance and sympathetic nature and attention shown by their partner, but more importantly we can see the background of the past and are ready to accept all the weaknesses that are owned by his partner and completes and helps both partners to build a harmonious and happy home.",

The stakes in respect of sexual offenders seem higher, since a badly constructed or inadequate assessment will fail to identify the sources of the individual's problems and, thereby, deny them the opportunity to address them. The assessor needs to balance optimism about the capacity of even the most reprehensible individuals to change with a scepticism that allows for the possibility that the real and covert goal of the individual may be to avoid changing at all. Actuarial risk assessment for sexual offenders rests upon a number of researched features that are associated with reconviction.",

It is clear that as the adolescent life stage is approached there are risk factors inherent in biological development, personal history and in the social context in which the individual finds him or herself. The litany of changes occurring during the extensive adolescent period, albeit that the changes may represent developmental milestones, has a significant impact on the adolescent's ability to deal with stress associated with the risk factors.

      "abstract": "Although the belief persists that sexuality is an adult concern, not to be spoken of with children and adolescents lest such discussions awaken desires and prompt early sexual initiation, in reality adult inhibitions and repressions have created a problem of adolescent sexuality where none need exist. A pregnant adolescent is immediately rejected by friends, family, and teachers, although later on she is again accepted. She has 2 alternatives: carrying the pregnancy to term or abortion. A 1981 study of adolescents aged 10-23 years indicated that the majority had had some type of sexual interaction such as caressing or kissing, but only minority had experienced coitus. The majority of the young people believed that virginity was desirable for both sexes. Few of the boys who had had intercourse had done so with prostitutes. 62% said that females took the initiative equally with males in sexual matters. The majority had heard of contraceptives and knew where to obtain them, but only 11% had ever used a method. Half did not know how their parents would react if they knew about their children's contraceptive usage, and 1/4 feared they would be expelled from the house or subjected to some other violent reaction if their parents found out. Only 18% thought their parents would have a sympathetic attitude. Half thought abortion was a crime but the rest had a range of attitudes reflecting the diverse attitudes of the general population. Various organizations in the Dominican Republic provide much-needed sex education which prompts the creation of conditions of equality and mutual respect in the family. The Adolescent Center of the Dominican Association for Family Welfare provides training in sex education for selected groups of adolescents, who spread their knowledge among their peers. In the past 3 years, 110 such adolescents, called multipliers, have been trained. 42 talks, 6 round tables, 4 intensive and 8 general courses in sex education have been provided for 8900 adolescents. 8 meetings attended by 200 parents of adolescents, 5 workshops attended by 169 teachers were held, 50 clients received psychological counseling, and a sex education manual was prepared.",

It documents that participants feel fundamentally misrecognised by the parole agency and penal state. They believe that the penal state views them as dangerous, defective and incapable of virtuous self-governance. Yet this is not how they perceive themselves. This leads to a delicate balancing act where participants refuse certain aspects of the penal state while accommodating others. On the one hand, individuals refuse parole’s misrecognition of them and reject the state’s authority to define who they are. On the other hand, they largely acquiesce to parole’s authority to supervise and regulate conduct. Turning to the concept of refusal highlights that individuals do not just attempt to resist penal power; rather, they flatly reject the state’s epistemic constructions. They do this by turning away from parole and by turning towards other forms of sociality beyond the penal state. This creates material and affective distance from parole and opens up space for self-recognition and for receiving positive recognition from others. In this way, individuals seek to minimise, move away from and/or bypass a penal intervention that is ostensibly designed to assist and support them.",

The responses seen in survivors are more like what is seen in post-traumatic stress where people tend to feel numb and detached and have limited interest in pursuing goals or new relationships. The increasing number of survivors dealing with the ever increasing deaths from AIDS need a clear definition of the meaning of multiple loss; a constellation of physical, emotional, and psychosocial issues swirling around waiting to be defined and understood.

Yet the reasons traditionally proffered in justification of criminalization of incest — respecting religion and universal tradition; avoiding genetic abnormalities; protecting the family unit; preventing sexual abuse and sexual imposition; and precluding immorality — at a close examination, reveal their under- and over-inclusiveness, inconsistency or outright inadequacy. It appears that the true reason behind the long history of the incest laws is the feeling of repulsion and disgust this tabooed practice tends to evoke in the majority of population. However, in the absence of wrongdoing, neither a historic taboo nor the sense of repulsion and disgust legitimizes criminalization of an act.",

      "title": "Adolescent Sexual Wellbeing: A Conceptual Framework",
      "abstract": "Positive aspects of sexuality remain understudied among adolescents globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, consensus is lacking on how to conceptualize different aspects of sexual wellbeing among young people. We propose a new conceptual framework for adolescent sexual wellbeing that draws on existing theories and definitions, grounded in theories related to positive youth development, empowerment, human rights, gender, social-ecological and life-course perspectives. The framework highlights six interrelated domains of key competencies that are central to healthy adolescent sexuality development, whether or not sexual activities occur: 1) sexual literacy, 2) gender equal attitudes, 3) respect for human rights and understanding consent, 4) critical reflection skills, 5) coping skills and 6) interpersonal skills. These competencies have the potential both to strengthen and impede adolescents’ sexual wellbeing in relation to both themselves and others. Personal sexual wellbeing includes, but is not limited to, having a positive sense of one’s own (sexual) self and body, and recognising and appreciating feelings of pleasure and desire. Relational sexual wellbeing can include developing and maintaining mutually respectful, gender equal relationships with other people that are that are part of young people’s sexual socialisation, such as peers, parents and community members. Over time, relational sexual wellbeing may also include outcomes related to intimate partners, such as equality in relationships, safe and pleasurable sexual interactions, free from violence and coercion. Whether young people are able to translate competencies into desired actions and achieve a sense of sexual wellbeing depends on the personal, social and economic resources available to them, their (sexual) agency, and on the influence of opportunity structures such as policies, laws and norms. We end with discussing the potential implications of the framework for public health programmes and research studies aiming to improve adolescent SRHR and wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Participation in social interactions constitutes a regular and inevitable feature of the everyday experience of infants from birth on. All social interactions, irrespective of their content or the age of the participants, involve highly intricate, closely synchronized sets of behavior patterns contributed by two or more individuals. They are dialogues, verbal or nonverbal, generally characterized by impressive \"smoothness\" and conducted according to sets of rules that are more often than not far from explicit. Development always occurs in an interpersonal context. In some respects, this is particularly true in the earliest stages, although in the adult, too, behavior has generally a social dimension without which it would lose its most distinctive characteristic. Sociability is multifaceted. It is constituted of a great many diverse, which may have little in common with one another except for the all-important fact that they jointly define the individual's capacity to participate in social life.",

      "abstract": "Significance We examined whether one mechanism contributing to ingroup favoritism might be an abstract and early-emerging sociomoral expectation of ingroup support. In violation-of-expectation experiments, 17-mo-old infants first watched third-party interactions among unfamiliar adults identified (using novel labels) as belonging to the same group, to different groups, or to unspecified groups. Next, one adult needed help, and another adult either did or did not provide it. Infants expected help to be provided when the two adults belonged to the same group, but held no expectation when the adults belonged to different groups or to unspecified groups. Infants thus already possess an abstract expectation of ingroup support, and this finding sheds light on one of the mechanisms underlying ingroup favoritism in human interactions.",

Accordingly, the practices of subordination and marginalization described in hegemonic masculinity theory are not used to regulate masculine behaviors or obtain dominance in this setting. At Standard High, boys ascribing to different masculine archetypes can each maintain high social status. Nonetheless, a social hierarchy still exists. Here, boys are stratified in accordance to a popularity ranking, which is determined by the possession of a matrix of variables: Namely, charisma, authenticity, emotional support, and social fluidity.",

      "title": "Body composition change",
      "abstract": "Humans di er from most other animals by having a fairly long lifespan and, \nproportionately, a long period of growth before adult morphology is attained. This \nchapter considers body composition changes associated with childhood, adolescence \nand adulthood from a health perspective, before considering in more detail how \nbody composition can be adjusted in the context of sport. Although this might \nsound straightforward, consider that it might take 12 years of sports participation \nbefore a world class athlete attains a career best. Future capability needs to be \nrecognised, understood and nurtured during childhood, while maintaining present \nhealth and safeguarding future health. Excessive training perturbs the body’s \nhomeostasis in musculo-skeletal, metabolic, endocrine, immune and psychologicaldomains; however, it appears that individual tolerance of high exercise volume and \nsusceptibility to overtraining is highly variable. Variability in the tempo of \nmaturation in children can represent an advantage or disadvantage depending on \nthe sport and gender. Knowledge of these issues is important for exercise \npractitioners and coaches alike, given the growing number of people whose body \ncomposition either predisposes them to increased risk of disease, or requires their \nbody composition to be optimised in order to enhance performance and reduce \ninjury risk. In this chapter we consider how kinanthropometry can be useful in \nyouth sports for talent development and improving sports performance. We will \nexplore the relationship between structure (as measured by anthropometry), \nphysiology, psychology and skill for talent identi cation and how  using these \nfactors in isolation may risk overlooking potential champion athletes. We outline \nhow to predict adult size and proportions from the growing child (morphological \nprediction), the optimal size and proportions for the ideal sports performance \n(morphological optimisation) in sport, and how athletes can tailor soft tissue for \nmaximum functional e ectiveness by training, tapering, etc. (morphological \nprototype). In addition, we examine how performance might be enhanced or \nretarded by biological maturity and how biological maturity is a ected by energy \nbalance in the young athlete.",

      "abstract": "Some Main Findings: Under 25% of the eligible sample group were registered as blind or partially sighted. This under representation of the problem makes planning for the future difficult. There were communication difficulties between many professionals and clients with associated differences in the perceptions of need. Professionals tend to work within their own ivory towers and do not communicate with professionals of other disciplines. This leads to patchy and uneven services. Low ratings of satisfaction were awarded to some groups of professionals, and these low ratings were often associated with communication difficulties. High ratings of satisfaction on the other hand tended to be awarded where the client had: an on-going relationship, with the same named person, who is an expert in the field, all three of these inter-linked factors being necessary for client satisfaction. The dynamics of family life are disturbed and disrupted by the diagnosis of blindness and the rearing of a severely visually impaired child in the majority of instances. Passage through crisis, however, does not inevitably lead to family breakdown and it is worthy of note that a number of the families studied, although severely tested, appeared to emerge from the crisis, not merely intact but actually strengthened.",

The elderly lose much with aging: decline in their senses, health, mobility, and independence. With admission to nursing homes, further loss occurs when the intimacy needs of the resident and their partner are often overlooked and ignored. This omission is resultant of society’s stereotypical and prejudicial thinking of the elderly as asexual or the sexual activity of older persons as perverse. Intimacy and touching are the last pleasurable things an elderly person gives up. The person who is denied touch, affection, or connection with another human being slowly deteriorates and dies physically and emotionally.",

Further investigations are needed to define social frailty and identify effective interventions to promote active aging by focusing on the social aspects in older adults with social frailty.

      "abstract": "School failure is pervasive. Its impact extends beyond the classroom and can contribute to emotional turmoil, social difficulties, delinquent behavior and lifelong maladjustment. School failure does not qualify as a disease, a syndrome, or a unique pathogenetic process. It is rather the product of constitutional predispositions that have interacted with environmental factors and life events in an ongoing process. Intrinsic handicaps may be subtle. Their outward manifestations are likely to vary from child to child and evolve with age, shaped by neurologic maturation, experience, and changing external expectations. Children with school problems form a heterogeneous group with diverse etiologies, symptom complexes, diagnostic findings and service needs. Nine common precursors of school failure are suggested in this review. Although presented individually, these precursors are not necessarily discrete, nor are they mutually exclusive; they may themselves stem from multiple factors. They are conceptualized as \"risk factors\" that may predispose to or foreshadow later failure. These, in turn, interact with a set of variables we have characterized as sources of \"developmental buoyancy.\" The latter may neutralize or counteract early susceptibility to academic problems. Individual children may have one or multiple identifiable precursors of variable severity and differ in the extent to which they can minimize or overcome these potential predispositions to school failure.",

Far from being utopian, nonviolent methods are powerful and successful in ending violence, but one of the greatest barriers is that the prevailing paradigm of violence not only promotes violence but makes nonviolence difficult to “see.” History abounds with examples, tracing back to prehistory and humanity's first civilizations, with notable examples over the last century occurring in India, the US, and the former Soviet Union. However, nonviolence is not only more difficult to detect but also harder to cultivate. Drawing upon the various spiritual traditions, nonviolence may develop within the depths of the person but manifest in communal campaigns and in groups. Nonviolence, as the opposite of violence, increases when violence diminishes along with established beliefs. Unlike violence, which is rigid, characteristics of nonviolence include creativity, diversity, and flexibility in applications. Examples of nonviolence include noncooperation, nonviolent intervention, constructive programming, and voluntary association. Far from being passive or ineffective, nonviolence gives us the lesson that peace is possible, not just by stemming destructive forces, but through fostering constructive ones.",

      "title": "Ethics",
      "abstract": "Professional ethics in anthropology reflects general moral principles regarding what one should not do and what one should do. However, in practice the emphasis is mostly on the negative; trying to avoid causing harm, and most of all to research subjects. Often concern with ethics within anthropology is more reactive than proactive. Also, it tends to be more a matter of defensive maneuvering to save face in public for the individuals and organizations involved, rather than grappling with issues let alone resolving them constructively and conclusively. Ethical concerns intensify during periods when scandals and/or controversies erupt, especially if they reach the general public to embarrass the profession. In the history of anthropology during the twentieth century into the present, many of the ethical controversies erupted about research associated with war, especially secret and/or clandestine activities. Politics is usually involved too, aggravating the difficulty and heat. However, there are also numerous and diverse cases beyond war because ethical challenges, dilemmas, and choices are inevitable. Yet when all is said and done, the ethical conduct of an anthropologist ultimately remains mostly a matter of personal morality, conscience, and integrity as well as adherence to ethical codes. Whole courses on professional ethics are rarely offered in departments of anthropology at universities and colleges for undergraduate or even for graduate majors as an elective, let alone requirement. Yet an abundance of literature and ethics codes are readily available for individuals to read, contemplate, discuss, and debate. Since the 1990s, and especially during the 2000s, there has been a marked increase in attention to professional ethics in anthropology. Much of this is one of the positive results of the controversy ignited by investigative journalist Patrick Tierney’s book Darkness in El Dorado, although there were also many negative consequences. Subsequently, the Human Terrain System, wherein anthropologists were embedded with the US military during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, ignited further controversy. This article focuses on professional ethics in cultural anthropology in the United States because of limited space. The emphasis is on books, rather than on journal articles, because the accumulating literature is enormous and books contain bibliographies for further research. Also, for journal articles and other sources, search Abstracts in Anthropology, Academic Search Complete, Annual Review of Anthropology, Anthropology Index Online, AnthroSource, Google Scholar, JSTOR, and ProQuest.",

      "abstract": "On a global level, from year to year there is an increase in the number of singles, that is, people who, either willingly or unwillingly, are not in any form of partner relationship, which increases the need for research into this specific phenomenon. This paper presents certain aspects of singlehood and the challenges faced by singles, which have been reviewed and researched in the previous literature: the reasons that lead to singlehood, ubiquitous stereotypes and discrimination, the psychological well-being of singles and their functioning in the context of the workplace and complying work with family and private life. Specific methodological challenges in the given field of research and guidelines for future research are also presented. Mainly, in this paper, singleness is analyzed taking into account the perspective of never-married adults without children, who are not in a committed romantic relationship. Despite the fact that, due to their status, they often have to face criticism from those who do not respect the plurality of attitudes and life choices, single people in terms of subjective well-being, generally did not prove to be inferior to married people. Nevertheless, the relationship between marital status and psychological well-being is still complicated and ambiguous. It has been shown that it is necessary to appeal for equality of rights and treatment in terms of working conditions, regardless of a person’s personal and family status, which would ultimately have a beneficial effect on organizations and society as a whole. The lack of a larger number of targeted studies of single people in Croatia is evident. In view of the above, it would be necessary to perform more detailed research that would thoroughly examine the role of the variables presented in this paper in the context of singlehood, but also other mechanisms and determinants of satisfaction and well-being of this group of people.",

      "abstract": "El VIH/sida es una enfermedad grave que puede causar la muerte y para la que aun no se ha encontrado cura. El agente etiologico del sida es el virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana VIH, el cual pertenece a la familia de los retrovirus. Los estudios confieren a los adolescentes un potencial grado de riesgo, basandose en el comienzo temprano de la actividad sexual, la existencia de multiples parejas sexuales, las relaciones poco duraderas y el uso de proteccion de forma inconsistente. En esta etapa del desarrollo se producen cambios en varias areas, especificamente en niveles fisicos y psicologicos, que generan un fuerte impacto en aspectos biopsicosociales, concretamente en el campo de la personalidad, la identidad y las relaciones con los demas, lo que se repercute en las actitudes y los comportamientos de los adolescentes. Las relaciones sexuales no protegidas colocan a los adolescentes en situaciones de riesgo, ya que las investigaciones indican que el conocimiento que los adolescentes tienen sobre el VIH/sida y sus formas de transmision son reducidas. Por otra parte, el hecho de que los adolescentes tengan un conocimiento menos superficial o un conocimiento mas profundo de la materia, no significa que, en la practica, tengan conductas sexuales seguras.\r\nEn Portugal existen algunos instrumentos que evaluan los conocimientos y las actitudes que los adolescentes tienen sobre el VIH/sida. El objetivo de este estudio es la validacion de una bateria de evaluacion sobre comportamientos relacionados con la salud, la sexualidad y el VIH/sida para adolescentes, que consta de tres escalas y dos cuestionarios. La muestra estuvo formada por 630 adolescentes con edades entre los 16 - 18 anos (M = 17, SD = 1). Se examino la estabilidad temporal mediante el metodo test-retest con una submuestra de 546 en la segunda evaluacion. De los 539 adolescentes que indicaron su sexo, 320 eran mujeres (59,4%) y cursaban decimo, undecimo y duodecimo ano de la educacion en instituciones educativas publicas y privadas localizadas en diferentes zonas de Portugal.\r\nLa version en portugues de la Escala de Conocimientos sobre el VIH/sida para Adolescentes (VIH-KS, Espada, Huedo-Medina, Orgiles, Secades, Remor y Ballester, 2009) se compone de 48 items divididos en dos factores, contrariamente a la version espanola que presenta tres factores. En relacion a los dos factores: factor 1- principales modos de transmision del VIH y el factor 2- conocimiento sobre los comportamientos de riesgo donde hay contacto con la saliva, los valores de alfa encontrados son superiores a 0,7 en ambos casos, por lo que demuestra ser una herramienta fiable en este caso.\r\nEl segundo instrumento validado es la Escala de Actitudes hacia el VIH/sida para Adolescentes (HIV-AS; Espada, Ballester, Huedo-Medina, Secades-Villa, Orgiles & Martinez-Lorca, 2013), que consta de 28 items. Esta version se divide en 4 factores: Factor 1 - actitud hacia el uso del preservativo, factor 2- actitud hacia las personas con VIH /sida; factor 3- actitud en relacion a las conductas de proteccion cuando existe algun obstaculo y factor 4- actitud la prueba del VIH. En relacion a los valores alfa, los coeficientes son superiores a 0,7, con la excepcion para el factor 3, que tiene un coeficiente de fiabilidad ligeramente inferior a 0,7.\r\nEn tercer lugar, se adapto a poblacion portuguesa el Cuestionario de Conductas Sexuales (p.e., Bersamin, Todd, Fisher, Hill, Grube, & Walker, 2008; Longmore, Eng. Giordano & Manning, 2009), que incluye 13 itens que abordan aspectos relacionados con las practicas sexuales cuyo objetivo es comprender los comportamientos de los adolescentes. El analisis estadistico se realizo en terminos individuales, con acceso a la validacion convergente.\r\nPor ultimo, la version en portugues de la Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI, Salkovskis et al., 2002) evalua los trastornos de salud relacionados con la ansiedad y la hipocondria. Esta escala tiene tres factores: Factor 1- percepcion de la salud /enfermedad; factor - reaccion a una enfermedad y factor 3- percepcion de los signos de la enfermedad y los cambios corporales. En cuanto al coeficiente alfa, la escala presenta fiabilidad en los 3 factores con un valor de 0,7, mientras que el tercer factor puede tener un bajo valor alfa. Incluso con un bajo porcentaje de la varianza, este ultimo se incluyo, para no fragilizar la escala.\r\nEste estudio tambien aclara el funcionamiento sexual de los adolescentes en relacion a comportamientos de riesgo, los conocimientos y las actitudes sobre la practica sexual y las preocupaciones con la salud, en relacion con las variables sociodemograficas. Los resultados indican que a pesar de que los participantes reconocen tener conocimientos sobre el VIH/sida, no tienen practicas de sexo seguro. Existe una correlacion debil entre sus conocimientos y los comportamientos sexuales protegidos adoptados. En cuanto al uso de los preservativos, hay una tendencia a que los adolescentes que tienen informacion adecuada acerca de este metodo lo utilicen como forma de proteccion. En relacion a la reaccion de la mayoria de los adolescentes frente a los amigos que tienen VIH/sida, no se verifican conductas de rechazo o prejuicios. Los que tienen informacion sobre la prueba del VIH, al adoptar practicas de riesgo admiten realizarian la prueba y que tambien aconsejaria a un amigo a someterse a este procedimiento. Existe una correlacion debil entre el conocimiento que los adolescentes tienen y la percepcion que tienen de su salud, en particular si hay signos de enfermedad. En cuanto al sexo, las chicas presentan un conocimiento mas significativo sobre el VIH/sida en comparacion con sus parejas. Los aspectos biomedicos, culturales e individuales propios de este sindrome, son el resultado de la resistencia al cambio en relacion a ciertos comportamientos sexuales inadecuados. Debido a las caracteristicas intrinsecas de la adolescencia, determinadas circunstancias socioeconomicas, educacionales y a veces politicas contribuyen para que sea dificil hacer llegar a ciertas poblaciones adolescentes el conocimiento sobre la importancia y la practica de comportamientos sexuales seguros. Esta constelacion de factores y el hecho de que los adolescentes estan expuestos a un riesgo importante en lo referente a la infeccion del VIH, es imprescindible la continuacion de la investigacion y la promocion de la intervencion en este ambito con este grupo de la poblacion.\r\nEn conclusion, las pruebas adaptadas presentan una estructura similar con adolescentes portugueses respecto a su version original, asi como adecuadas propiedades psicometricas, por lo que pueden ser de utilidad para la evaluacion de factores de riesgo sexual y de programas preventivos con poblacion portuguesa.",

      "title": "[Suicide: clinical and systematic aspects of the self-responsibility dimension].",
      "abstract": "Suicide is a tragic, extreme, and unusual act which evokes powerful emotions. Doctors, psychologists, social workers, lawyers and Renaissance men are trying to research factors leading to suicide. They believe that finding the critical factors may reduce the incidence of suicide. The causative factors leading to suicide are complicated and diverse. A society's moral stance on the issue of suicide influences an individual's inclination to implement the act itself. There is a wide variety of viewpoints between different societies. Societies, with a supportive view, that treat suicide as a noble act, have a high incidence of suicide. Those with a condemning view, that may even deem suicide as a criminal act, have a lower suicide rate. Society's view of suicide is linked to the question of responsibility for the act itself. The responsibility is composed of moral, public and legal obligations. The question is: should most of the responsibility be the deceased's or society's medical and paramedical personnel, who might be held responsible for not recognizing the warning signs and not preventing the act itself. We wish to contend that a professional, cultural, public and legal approach that preserves an individual's responsibility for one's own decisions - even one of self-destruction - will prevent a moral judgment and criticism of the deceased. The aforementioned may decrease the incidence of suicide seen with a neutral approach that foregoes the deceased's individual responsibility. The second section of the article deals with the legal aspects of the act of suicide as expressed in the legislation for the treatment of the mentally ill. The assumption is that the law reflects the viewpoint of a society, thereby influencing the tendencies and processes within. Therefore, a change or amendment to the law may influence the attitude towards it, and the prevalence of the phenomenon in the long run.",

      "title": "\"Discredited\" and \"Discreditable:\" The Search for Political Identity by People with Psychiatric Diagnoses",
      "abstract": "You're never the same--mental health diagnosis is an opinion and attitude. You cannot cure or have remission from others' attitudes of rejection. (1) Friends and family--they don't understand my illness/disability--they think I am getting away with something--that there is nothing wrong with me. (2) INTRODUCTION Identity matters. In particular, identity matters to people who are stigmatized and stereotyped because they belong to a socially disfavored group. Although individual members of these groups may have very different ideas about how to respond to prejudice and mistreatment, the matter of identity itself--membership in the group--is generally not at issue. Justice Clarence Thomas and the Reverend Jesse Jackson may have sharply conflicting ideas about the meaning of being an African American in our society, but the identity of each man as an African American is hardly open to question. When it comes to disabilities, however, these distinctions begin to blur, in part because disability is as much about environmental context and social functioning as it is about any physical or mental characteristic. Asthma may or may not be a disability, depending on the presence of pollen and pollutants in the air. Mild mental retardation may be less disabling in a rural farming community than in a busy urban environment. In addition, impairments exist along a spectrum, both physical and functional, rather than representing a dichotomy between a class of clearly identified people differentiated unmistakably from nondisabled people. Therefore, a person's self-identification as disabled is often not as automatic as self-identification with respect to race and sex. In fact, self-identification as a person with a disability is often a long, complex, and difficult process. In this respect it may resemble self-identification as gay or lesbian. Disability, unlike race and sex, but like sexual preference, is usually not identifiable at birth, (3) and often becomes salient in an individual's life after she has formed a personal identity. Indeed, one of the most hurtful aspects of disability discrimination is that newly persons find it very difficult to accept that people who knew them before they became can treat them so differently once they are disabled, and people with hidden disabilities are shocked when they are abandoned by old friends and even family after they reveal their disabilities. The fact that disabilities exist along a spectrum contributes to another disparity between the identity of people and the identity of people in other groups that experience discrimination. Because disabilities exist along a spectrum, it is unclear when someone actually becomes Disability is a status that is initially identified, named, or conferred, not by the individual, but by usually medical experts, although the ramifications of disability are significantly social and political. Furthermore, unlike race or gender, experts hold themselves out as being able to mitigate or treat disability. (4) Although people with disabilities have challenged the claims and dominance of experts for many years, experts retain a position of primacy in defining both the categories and the meaning of physical and mental disability, and are considered the only authority on the mitigation, treatment or cure of the disability. (5) The centrality of experts to the experience of disability has enormous social, legal, and political consequences. A large number of cases under the Americans with Disabilities Act involve claims by the plaintiff that she is disabled. (6) Defendants dispute these claims by hiring experts to refute the plaintiff's claims to identity as a person with a disability. In many cases, the Supreme Court has rejected the plaintiff's claim to belong to the protected group--persons with disabilities. (7) This process--permitting experts and the judiciary to determine whether an individual fits into a protected class--would be unthinkable in the case of race, gender, age, religion, or sexual orientation. …",

      "title": "Reporting child abuse",
      "abstract": "The physical mistreatment of children (including sexual abuse) and the dangerous neglect of them are crimes in most countries. Yet prosecutions are uncommon—not necessarily because the case cannot be proved but because it is not in the interests of the victim (s) or the family as a whole to proceed in this way. A non-accidental death has to go down a different route, and there will always be examples of child abuse so horrid that no alternative to criminal prosecution can be contemplated. When the perpetrator is an outsider, so that the future integrity of the family is not quite such a big issue, it may still not be in a child's interests to handle the matter as a criminal one. In the criminal, in contrast to the civil, courts the primary concern is no longer the victim but justice to the accused, and even with videotaped evidence that means putting a child through another ordeal. We believe that this dichotomy—child abuse of any sort is handled either by the police and the legal system or via a multidisciplinary team of health and social workers—is a false one.Of course, the choice will never arise until a suspicion of mistreatment is reported and tested in some way, and it is at this early point that different countries begin to separate in a similar dichotomy—eg, a mandatory route in the USA and a confidential medical system in Belgium and the Netherlands. In Ireland the government is under great pressure from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children to alter its stance, which is one of resistance to a mandatory system despite the verdicts of official reports on child abuse scandals in that country. The International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect held a two hour debate on this subject as part of its conference in Dublin. No vote was taken and the pairs of arguments, two in favour of mandatory testing and two opposed, were finely balanced.This past week in Stockholm, governments have been meeting to discuss one especially deplorable aspect of child abuse, the international tourist trade offering sex with children. The UK government, which had previously looked with disfavour on the notion that such tourists could be prosecuted in their own countries, is showing signs of relenting. Elsewhere, however, it seems unlikely that there can ever be much international agreement. For instance, mandatory reporting is practised by about half the countries taking part in the latest ISPCAN survey. Recognising this is important, lest unflattering comparisons be made from survey figures such as the latest from the USA, recorded on p606.Mandatory/voluntary is a false dichotomy because those in the voluntary camp know that some cases have to be referred to the criminal courts, while having a mandatory system can simply mean judicial supervision of a plan of action that the voluntary camp would recognise and approve of, no punishment being involved. Furthermore, there is already a consensus that reporting of either sort has to be accompanied by good systems of training and support for those trying to help the family. To impose mandatory reporting when those systems are not yet in place and budgeted for is silly; equally, doctors suspecting abuse cannot help much until they report somewhere so that multidisciplinary back-up can be provided. There are excellent examples of caring systems of family therapy in which local police have confidence. These systems are, of course, pragmatic. However those who operate them need to recognise that such confidential approaches will not work in every case and cannot even be considered in circumstance such as organised paedophilia. With those provisos, the dissemination of best practice could do much both to blur the starker dichotomies in this troubling area of child care and to prevent, especially at this time of great public anxiety, a rush into inflexible methods of working.

Nevertheless, very old people are not usually depressed or dissatisfied with their aging. To explain this paradox, the concept of Psychological Resilience is used, which has been adopted from the field of Child and Adolescent Psychopathology and applied to old age given the magnitude of the deficits usually associated with aging. Biological, psychological, social and socio-demographic factors have been suggested as elements of resistance that maintain well-being. In view of our interest in the ability of humans to efficiently handle the problems linked to the aging process, the present article focusses on one these factors - coping. Coping has attracted a great deal of attention as a resistance-related mechanism for adjustment and control throughout the life span. The way in which a very old person copes with a situation depends on his/her internal and external resources, such as health, maturity, education, gender, etc. The studies that we have undertaken confirm the relationship between ways of dealing with difficulties and quality of life amongst the very old, which is indicative of the protective role of coping in advanced old age.",

      "abstract": "The major emphasis of recent literature on adolescent sexuality and pregnancy has been on the important social consequences of early sexual activity; little attention has been given to the risk factors that serve as antecedents to an unplanned adolescent pregnancy. Although the risk factors for early initiation of sexual activity vary in different populations of adolescents they include the transition to puberty peer and sibling influences poverty family structure and function poor school achievement other problem behaviors and inadequate contraceptive use. Adolescents living in poverty are more likely than their middle-class counterparts to begin sexual activity at an early age and to become pregnant in adolescence. Other aspects of family structure that place adolescents at risk are single-parent families large numbers of siblings lack of parental supervision and a pregnant adolescent sister. The adolescents negative experience with school also has been associated with teen pregnancy. In many cases there is a clustering of risk-taking behaviors such as smoking alcohol and drug abuse unprotected sexual intercourse and driving while intoxicated. Social influences including the sexual behavior of best friends appear to be key in determining age at onset of sexual activity among teenage girls while level of physical development and free testosterone levels exert a greater impact on adolescent males. Another risk factor is the 9-12 month median delay between the onset of teen sexual activity and the 1st attempt to seek family planning care from a medical provider. To assess these risk factors physicians who care for adolescents should elicit information about family social background friends school and career plans drug use and physical development. Preventive efforts will be successful only when they address the complexity of the issue of adolescent sexuality.",

While child sexual abuse involves the child in a physical deed, its harmful developments are predominantly shown in the child's psyche. Its considerable risk factors for developing psychopathology lie not just in childhood and adolescence, but also into adulthood. Child sexual abuse is highly under-reported in India, which has attained epidemic proportions. It is still seen as a taboo, creating a sense of discomfort where most communities try to hide, ignore, or mistrust the accusations. In healthcare, it thus becomes paramount to understand the warning signs, the likelihood of revelation while interviewing, and the dynamics of the family about culture and implications that can come along with the abuse. With a keen understanding of the types of abuse and an awareness of the proceedings after the disclosure, safety can be targeted.",

      "abstract": "Freedom and responsibility, how much of each and how they are balanced, have profound implications for our personal lives and for our work. The health of a population and its achievement in the workplace are enhanced when individuals have some freedom and some responsibility, but not too much of either, and when civil associations of individuals rather than individuals acting alone are the essential social units. The consistent association of social contacts with health and productivity provides strong support for the premise that intimate relationships are the focus around which people's lives revolve. Membership of a \"social network\" may be merely conforming to a reigning social norm, and this could mean having to pay an important price in the loss of creativity associated with individualism. But social conformity should not prevent individuals from going their own way, and it should be possible to combine the luxury of individuality with an active life in civic affairs. Less than complete freedom may fall short of existential utopia, but it may be best for our health and wellbeing.",

Nowadays Klaibya is considered as one of the most common problems affecting the males having variable severity. Change in lifestyle, food habits, sedentary lifestyle and some psychological causes like Chinta, Shoka, Bhaya, Krodha etc. causes Klaibya. The male sexual dysfunctions have been elaborately described as Klaibya (Impotency) in Ayurvedic classics. In clinical practices Klaibya (Impotency) is the most common psychosexual disorders. It has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patients along with their partners. It is projected as a medico-social problem. Vajikarana, a specialized branch of Ayurveda deals in treating these problems. It refers to a problem during any phase of the sexual cycle that restricts the man from experiencing satisfaction from the activity. Nowadays the incidence of sexual dysfunction is increasing due to age, sedentary life style, unhealthy foods etc. About 5% of 35 years old men and between 15% and 25% of 50 years old men experience sexual dysfunctions. Vajikarana (Medicine which improves sexual capability) branch of Ashtanga Ayurveda (one of the subjects of Ayurved study) deals with fertility, potency and healthy progeny. In this branch diagnosis and management of infertility and Sexual dysfunction are dealt in detail.",

      "abstract": "The child abuse in its various forms, physical, sexual and psychological violence, is a complex phenomenon, potentially able to alter not only the natural development of the subject abused, but also his ability to relate to others. This paper aims to point out the way that the child has to take from the moment he decided to take over being a victim of abuse at the time when it is called to testify about the abuse right away, with all the difficulties that this witness implies, not only for the child himself, but also for those who are called upon to decide and rule on the quality of that testimony. The art. 196 of the current Code of Criminal Procedure recognizes everyone the ability to testify, then, including minors. Nothing therefore prevents the operators from taking information from a child in criminal trials. Moreover, investigators have wide discretion not only \"if\" hearing the minor, but also on the methods to do it. This entails serious risks on the authenticity of the evidential result: mnestic lability, suggestibility, tendency to pander to the interlocutor's expectations, all of which are typical factors of the minor that can compromise the correct reconstruction of the facts.",

      "title": "SOCIAL DILEMMA STUDIES",
      "abstract": "Very often, each individual continues to do something for his/her individual advantage that collectively is damaging to the group as a whole. The conflict is labeled as “social dilemma” or “social trap” by social psychologists. The phenomenon is very common in individualistic cultures (the West), but does the same phenomenon exist in collectivistic cultures which value cooperation and group goals more than individual benefits? The present authors employed a “replenishable ocean resource paradigm” that they developed on a series of studies in Taiwan and found that selfish behaviors were indeed very pervasive in the East. Several significant factors that affected the degree of cooperation and/or competition were also identified: sanction system, personal motivation, interpersonal relation, and the composition of decision making groups. In brief, it was found that the lower the severity of punishment or the less probability of being caught, the more selfish the subjects' behaviors became. Subjects with the motives to maximize “individual gain” and “relative gain” competed more and did not differ from each other, while “joint gain” subjects competed the least. In addition, decisions made by group of three or five people were more selfish than the decisions made by the individual. The present authors and their associates also compared the behaviors of Taiwan and American students in the social dilemma situation directly. It was found that subjects from two cultures did differ on the cooperative behaviors. Taiwan subjects were more competitive than American subjects in general. Both “probability of inspection” and “degree of punishment” had significant effect on the Taiwanese's behaviors, but only “inspection probability known or not” affected American subjects. In respects to Collectivism/Individualism Scale, Taiwan subjects did not score higher than American subjects on total collective measure, but Taiwan subjects scored higher than American subjects on collectivism toward spouses, parents, and relatives, and scored less than American subjects on collectivism toward colleagues/classmates and friends. Therefore, Taiwan subjects interacting with colleagues/classmates or friends were more selfish than American subjects. General discussion on the meaning, application and cross-cultural implication of this series of studies concludes this paper.",

      "abstract": "The increase of senior citizens in last decades and the greater longevity of the population will bring a high demand for services in the final stages of life. There is a close association between ageing-as a process that intersects what is biological, social and biographical-and death, that actually can not be separated from culture. Old age is a stage of loss and reduced capability. Not only at the visible level but also related to its performance, the biological body is no longer what it used to be and it undergoes a negative transformation. Along with the biological and biographical spheres, there is the social one, related to values. Crucially, ageing is the biographical stage evidenced by certain exterior attributes. According to the social clock of each community it has its own duties and rights. All behavioural normative becomes senseless if there is no freedom to accept or reject it. Only in such a context dialogue-which constitutes the very essence of social life-can be practiced. If lost, the own identity as a moral agent or as an autonomous person gets damaged. The ethics of quality of life in old age must be founded and grounded on moderate, modest, and factible expectations. Dialogue is the most important tool with which bioethical discourse has contributed to modern societies. Even though medicine is a basic social metaphor, care and social insertion procedures should include a special sensibility towards relationships of power, the contexts wherein human relations are interpreted, and the cultural facts that influence the treatment of the elderly.",

What is the message they are supposed to deliver? Many people are occupied by the question about the meaning of their present age and what it demands from them. Is it charming or awkward to be playful and giggly when you are fifty years old? You could see the concept of childishness as a cultural relay for conflicting ideas about how one should behave and what it means to be a grown-up. In this power-transmitting concept strong ideas about responsibility and naivety are connected in crucial situations where the maturity of the participants is an uncertain circumstance.",

      "title": "Missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls: A case for abuse screening in at‐risk paediatric populations",
      "abstract": "American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people experience the highest rates of homicide and violence in the USA and Canada.1 This propensity for violence and sexual crimes has manifested as the crisis referred to as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, with more than 5000 young women having suffered homicide, kidnapping or trafficking in the USA.2 AI children are not exempt from these statistics. When compared to non-AI populations there is a statistically significantly higher proportion of AI/AN reporting of emotional, physical and sexual abuse.3 This same disparity is also true regarding emotional and physical neglect.3 Abuse and violence affect all communities, but as paediatric providers, many of the patients we treat lack the vocabulary, maturity or both to express their needs, rendering them particularly vulnerable. These conversations can be difficult, especially when there is fear that the questions asked might alienate or offend the families we are trying to serve. Medical trainees are often uncomfortable in screening for child abuse, particularly, during encounters where the signs are subtle or unrelated to the chief complaint. Medical schools and residency programmes often lack the curriculum needed to educate trainees on how to approach suspected abuse cases or the resources available to families.4 Additionally, the lack of a standardised approach to survey for abuse further complicates effective recognition and management. However, evidence suggests that residents who learn to address family psychosocial issues, including violence and abuse, are more likely to screen for these issues in practice and ultimately connect patients with needed resources.4 Several validated screening tools, including the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (IPSCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool for Children (ICAST-C) and Escape Form have demonstrated effectiveness at screening children for abuse.5, 6 The Escape Form evaluates risk based on the patient's history, the development of the child, the appropriateness of interaction between the child and caretakers, the consistency of the physical examination compared with the history, if there was a delay in seeking care and other safety concerns.6 Results from this form provide an ‘at-risk score’ that creates an objective manner of evaluation that can allow for consistency in evaluation. Review of this model has demonstrated an increase in abuse screening, trainee comfort with screening and most importantly, an increase in detection of cases that is five times higher when compared to cases of children that were not screened.6 The American Academy of Pediatrics offers several resources through ‘The Resilience Project’ aimed at addressing violence and toxic stress at both the medical practice and policy levels.7 This online resource provides tools for families, care givers and providers who treat children and youth exposed to violence.7 The implementation of the ‘Training Toolkit’ may prove valuable to trainees and early career physicians, helping them to learn the different types of violence that our paediatric patients may experience. The expanding education on patient and family-centred communication throughout clinical training may better equip future paediatricians to identify abuse and develop the confidence to start the appropriate dialogue to curb its effects. This national crisis of violence against AI/AN women and girls challenges paediatricians to find ways to address the gap in protecting girls from becoming the missing and the murdered. Screening both for abuse and family wellness is a critical step for paediatricians in addressing this crisis. Gaining the confidence to implement these skills can be undoubtedly challenging. Structured teaching and guidance can empower residents to identify abuse and will be a life-changing event for trainees and the families we treat.",

      "title": "Navigating the circles of social life: understanding pathways to sport drop-out among French teenagers",
      "abstract": "Sports practice is a way to be physically active. Despite public health efforts to support it, teenagers' sport participation is declining in some European countries. One reason for the decline is drop-out from sports practice. Various analytical frameworks have been applied to this issue but little is known about how teenagers understand their own pathway in the social context, ending with a drop-out from sports practice. This study aimed to identify reasons given by teenagers about sports practice drop-out situated within the circles of their everyday lives, through 100 semi-structured interviews. The results made it possible to classify the reasons for dropping out into five themes: friendship, body, family, school, and sport. Two processes lead to drop-out: constraints which prevent access to the circle of sports practice and/or a decision-making that brings them out of it. The respondents could mention one or multiple reasons, accumulating (snowball effect) or following one another (cascade effect). Depending on the moment of drop-out, some circles of social life played a preponderant role. The family seemed to be central in the decision to drop out during primary school, whereas sport itself and school were influential in middle and high schools respectively. The results showed that the more recent the drop-out, the more the teenagers planned to resume sports practice. These data are relevant for health education policies to prevent physical inactivity through sport. It is important not only to remove the constraints that prevent access to the circle of sports practice, but also to promote the most pleasurable sports experiences.",

Shame dissipations were longer but less specific in content, and respondents were more likely to use the \"projective\"second person when describing shame than guilt. The observed content differences were generally consistent with current theory. Guilt was typically induced by specific moral transgressions, often involving harm to others. Shame was induced by specific moral transgressions as well as by nonmetal situations and issues (e.g., failure in performance situations, social{y inappropriate behavior or dress). The analysis of interpersonal concerns indicated that both shame and guilt can arise from a concern with one's effect on another person. Concern with others' evaluations, however, were almost exclusively the domain of shame. Although there appear to be some classic shame-inducing situations and some classic guilt-inducing situations, the majority of situations appear capable of engendering either emotion.",

People with high self-esteem perceive themselves favorably. They generally like themselves and believe they are competent and capable of handling life’s challenges. Conversely, those with low self-esteem regard themselves as incapable, unlikable, or even unworthy. Low self-esteem is related to depression and a number of psychosomatic ailments such as loss of appetite, insomnia, nervousness, and headaches. On the whole, people with low self-esteem do not feel valued by themselves or by others and doubt their ability to add value. Self-acceptance and self-esteem are thus critical for mattering. Self-esteem has important implications for a host of life domains. Those high in self-esteem experience more positive emotions and are significantly happier than those with low self-esteem. In fact, high self-esteem is considered one of the most dominant predictors of happiness.",

      "abstract": "With diet and exercise bodies are routinely shaped and sculpted to adhere not only to standards of health and medicine but also, and perhaps more regularly, to sociocultural appearance norms. Likewise, we can just as routinely observe how bodies are subject to the regimented norms of posture, somatic rules for how they smell, and both written and unwritten rubrics of exposure—especially how much flesh may be revealed, under what circumstances, and with whom. Bodies are clothed with garments, both visible and veiled, that simultaneously conceal as much as they expressively accentuate. Everywhere, and at all times, bodies are actively inscribed with any one or more of the physical markers of powerful social institutions including age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and religion. Bodies are habitually maintained, and chiefly not for functional but aesthetic qualities in acts including the various means of growing hair in some parts of the body while, elsewhere, cutting, shaving, plucking, or chemically removing it. Similarly, other body maintenance regimens include things such as altering the color and texture of hair, skin, eyes, finger or toe nails. Teeth are straightened, whitened, polished, and replaced if necessary. Bodies are stylized with piercings, tattoos, hairstyles, and procedures for tanning, bleaching, and painting. Bodies are perpetually on display although, as we learn through the course of socialization, one must be cautious about whose bodies we gaze upon, where specifically we affix that gaze, for how long, and at what proximity. In all of these ways and a multitude of others, the body is clearly the site of enormous expressive and impressive appearance management as well as a focal point for significant ritual activity—two dynamics that are, without question, foremost to dramaturgical analysis.",

First, the architecture of the brain and the process of skill formation are influenced by an interaction between genetics and individual experience. Second, the mastery of skills that are essential for economic success and the development of their underlying neural pathways follow hierarchical rules. Later attainments build on foundations that are laid down earlier. Third, cognitive, linguistic, social, and emotional competencies are interdependent; all are shaped powerfully by the experiences of the developing child; and all contribute to success in the society at large. Fourth, although adaptation continues throughout life, human abilities are formed in a predictable sequence of sensitive periods, during which the development of specific neural circuits and the behaviors they mediate are most plastic and therefore optimally receptive to environmental influences. Early family environments are major predictors of cognitive and noncognitive abilities.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, health problems in childhood and adolescence are related to developmental problems, which are typical for these two phases of life. Research shows that physiological expressions of chronic diseases in childhood and adolescence only have a low prevalence. However, psychosomatic and sociosomatic forms of health problems are on the rise. Insufficient processing of and coping with development-related challenges can lead to disorders not anchored exclusively in either physical, mental, or social factors, but which float between these three dimensions. These include immune system insufficiency, lack of physical activity, excess nutrition, overweight, unproductive coping with moods, depressive and aggressive tensions, and consumption of psychoactive substances. In adolescence, the different process of reconciling mental individuation and social integration can give rise to transitory and lasting disorders which affect the health-disease balance. Adolescent risk behavior is an specific expression of this developmental problem. Gender-specific differences are obvious. The paper comes to the conclusion that children and adolescents need a multi-facetted social network of support and help.",

Although aging itself does not cause the health problems, increasing numbers of conditions are related to advancing age as the result of exposure to years of social and behavioral risks. Older adults' experience of living with multiple conditions and decisions around their treatment are complicated by a lack of consensus on how to measure the multiple conditions and what conditions to include, as well as to limited evidence on why some conditions cluster and others do not, resulting in consequences that may be additive, multiplicative, or interactive. A better understanding of those issues is crucial given the challenges to individuals and societies caused by population aging and the increasingly acknowledged need for patient‐centered care in the United States and around the world.",

It can be said that without sexual desire there would be no love, no sexual passion, and no sexual excitement. Humans therefore would be unable to propagate. Lu Xun once sagaciously pointed out that \"sexual desire is a matter of maintaining prosperity and perpetuating life.\" Once young people enter puberty, they have natural sexual desires and impulses. Often they try to relieve their sexual tensions and satisfy their sexual desires by masturbation or other self-comforting means. If young people do not control themselves, masturbation will become a bad habit that damages their physical and mental well-being. Some young people who cannot control their sexual impulses engage in premarital sex and even commit sexual crimes. Sexual debauchery after marriage may even lead to extramarital affairs and result in marital tragedy. Whether one is married or not, every person should keep a tight reign on his or her sexual desires and avoid licentiousness through self-control.",

Narrators' ratings of their marriages ranged from \"excellent\" to \"disastrous.\" The major causes of marital failure described were lack of emotional mutuality and communication, physical and emotional abuse, and alternative adulterous relationships. Health and other crises were significant for some couples. Half the couples had been in marital therapy and half in individual therapy. Severe problems went on for many years, as did the contemplation of divorce. Some reported great suffering yet did not find the strength to initiate a divorce. Often a personal growth experience or development of inner strength helped one side to take the initiative to divorce after years of mutual suffering. The narrators emphasized suffering within the marriage more heavily than outside attractions; but half of the initiators had alternative relationships at the time of the initiation. Divorce in this group was a process that developed over a long time, not a spontaneous or impulsive response to any immediate acute trigger.",

Like a large number of social beliefs, attitudes towards equality take their direction from beliefs about the self, the status of the self, and one's self-esteem or lack thereof. Equality must be treated within classes, not between them, to be meaningful—and in this way the problem of placing oneself becomes tolerable, or sometimes rather gratifying. The psychic defenses against subordination available in stressing moral equality or superiority were used—but only rarely. Equality would pose problems of social adjustments, of manners, of how to behave. Consider the possibility of social equality including genuine fraternization, without economic equality. The fears, while plausible and all too human on the face of it, emerged unexpectedly from the interview material designed to capture ideas and emotions on other aspects of class status.",

It is a general tendency whenever people see a common problem which is incapable of solution by single individuals.

The importance of taking a sexual history is partly in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction which is rated as high as 31% of men and 43% in women. Sexual symptoms are often indicators of underlying endocrinological, neurological, psychological and cardiovascular disease and can be related to side effects of medication or following surgical treatment. Organic issues may be more likely if the issue is: present in older patients, gradually appeared, tends to occur in all situations; is persistent/progressive; accompanied by risk factors for the organic concern; if accompanied by partnership or anxiety, they are often secondary reaction.",

The task for personality researchers is to identify the specific non-shared environmental factors that contribute to personality differences. Parenting practices are often blamed. It is common to hear that parents were too lax with their children or sometimes even that parents were too harsh and that the teen was rebelling against parental authoritarianism. Children with conduct disorder tended to evoke the same kinds of parenting behaviors regardless of whether the interaction was with their own mom or another adult in the study. Parenting might be a response to personality as much as it is a potential cause of personality. Moreover, parenting itself might not act to make siblings similar because parenting is a function of specific parent–child interactions.",

      "title": "Poor contraceptive use in the teenage years: situational and developmental interpretations.",
      "abstract": "Contraceptive methods have helped to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among married women over the past few decades. Rates for teenagers have not, however, declined commensurately. Instead, greater premarital sex has led to more conceptions and births among teens. Developmental hypotheses suggest that poor teenage contraceptive use stems from characteristics intrinsically related to young age. Situational hypotheses, however, posit that life conditions complicate and impede the adoption of an effective contraceptive program. Social proscriptions against teen sex, the sporadic, unplanned, nature of teen sexual encounters, limited knowledge at the onset of 1st sex, and limited mobility and access to contraception are such life conditions. This essay considers both developmental and situational interpretations of teen contraceptive practice. Factors discussed related to contraceptive use include race and socioeconomic status, marital status, educational aspirations, religion, knowledge of fertility and contraception, attitudes and beliefs about contraception, personality factors, influence of parents, peers, and partners, and age. Adults and teens are found to have similar determinants of contraceptive behavior. Contraceptive use behavior differences between adults and teens may therefore exist because sexually active teens are disproportionately represented in demographic groups most likely to take risks. Adolescents being generally single, of low personal income, and increasingly members of single parent homes, share demographic circumstances of adults who are also more prone to risk-taking behavior. Limited knowledge of contraceptives and comparatively high levels of sex guilt further predispose youths to taking risks. Teenagers are therefore more likely to experience as a group those factors predisposing them to early sexual initiation and poor contraceptive use, thereby suggesting a situational interpretation of age differentials in contraceptive use. Adults similar to teens in adult life are similarly likely to take contraceptive risks.",

So, to get more knowledge about this issue, a comparative study has been designed on the sample of 100 individuals of age range (18-25) years with the help of Social Anxiety questionnaire for Adults (SAQ-A-30), and this study had been majorly conducted on the adults so as to examine the Gender differences (male/female) in the issue of suffering from social anxiety. This questionnaire also focuses of 5 sub-dimensions like, Speaking in public/talking with people in authority, Interaction with the opposite sex, Assertive expression of annoyance, disgust, or displeasure, Criticism and embarrassment and interaction with strangers.

      "title": "Disorganized Attachment, Development of Dissociated Self States, and a Relational Approach to Treatment",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Disorganized (D) attachment, and the double-bind characteristics of the relationships that foster it, form a basis for theoretical approaches to understanding the development of alternating, dissociated self states with incompatible, idealizing/devaluing or victim/persecutor models of attachment, such as are observed in borderline personality and dissociative disorders. This model proposes that the double binds inherent in abuse by a primary caretaker are likely to generate two or more dissociated self states, with contradictory working models of attachment. In contrast, because dissociated states ensuing from extra-familial trauma can be expected to have been constructed primarily around fear, all parts of the self will operate according to the same attachment paradigm. Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as trauma in the development of dissociated self states, this has important implications for treatment of child abuse survivors. D attachment may result from several parental behaviors: abuse, neglect, frightening, intrusive or insensitive manner; and disrupted affective communication. Longitudinal research demonstrates that D attachment in infancy predicts dissociation in childhood and early adulthood. Theoretical models describing the relationships among D attachment, the development of segregated internal working models of attachment, and the emergence of dissociated self states will be discussed. A relational approach to therapy calls for consideration of attachment issues in creating the frame for therapy and tailoring treatment to the individual trauma survivor. The therapist can serve as a relational bridge between dissociated self states, allowing the patient to internalize a working model of the therapeutic relationship. This interaction provides a vehicle for integrating dissociated self states and opportunity for development of more flexible, adaptive models of being with others.",

      "abstract": "Over the first year and a half of life, the duration of memory becomes progressively longer, the specificity of the cues required for recognition progressively decreases after short test delays, and the latency of priming progressively decreases to the adult level. The memory dissociations of very young infants on recognition and priming tasks, which presumably tap different memory systems, are also identical to those of adults. These parallels suggest that both memory systems are present very early in development instead of emerging hierarchically over the 1st year, as previously thought. Finally, even young infants can remember an event over the entire “infantile amnesia” period if they are periodically exposed to appropriate nonverbal reminders. In short, the same fundamental mechanisms appear to underlie memory processing in infants and adults.",

      "title": "The Systematic Estimation of the Leucocytosis in Certain Cases of Insanity: with Special Reference to the Toxæmic Theory",
      "abstract": "Surveying insanity as a whole, one recognises as a fundamental fact that insane persons belong to a class who start life with a “deficient grade of organisation” of the nervous system called “hereditary predisposition.” Some authorities hold that this is the sine quâ non of insanity, but such a view, I consider, is not strictly accurate. It is certainly not borne out by statistics. All observers, using even indifferent discrimination, must have noticed cases in which no hereditary factor could be traced, but in which much self-abuse had occurred—either in the form of alcoholic, sexual, and other excesses—or where syphilis or other powerful toxæmic conditions had been contracted. Such conditions, I argue, may themselves break down the most hardy constitution and leave it a prey to secondary infections or intoxications, which may manifest themselves as insanity. Assuming that the insane, prior to their attack of mental disease, suffer from either some hereditary weakness, or some acquired constitutional degeneration, it is most probable that such defects act a dual part, weakening not only the nervous system, so that it is more susceptible to the actions of toxins and environments, but also weakening the natural defences of the body. The nervous system of these people is thus laid open to more severe and frequent attacks from poisonous substances, whether of bacterial, metabolic, or other sources, than is the nervous system of a more normally organised individual. In support of this statement I would mention that Dr. L. C. Bruce has pointed out that over 60 per cent. of maniacal patients were deficient in the normal protective agglutinin to certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. This agglutinin is always present in healthy sera. Further, Dr. C. J. Shaw has ably demonstrated that the reason tubercular diseases account for so large a proportion of the deaths in asylums lies, not in any faulty hygienic precautions, but in the fact that the resistive power of the insane to tubercular infection is below par. Assuming that this hypothesis is true, we can more readily understand why the various insanities so frequently resist our efforts to cure them.",

      "title": "Secrets and Lies: Adolescent Religiosity and Concealing Information from Parents",
      "abstract": "There is very little research on the relationship between adolescent religiosity and concealing information from parents, although research on religiosity and family life is plentiful. Therefore, I used the second wave of the National Study of Youth and Religion to examine the relationship between adolescent religiosity and lying to parents and keeping secrets from parents. The results suggest that adolescents who attend religious services more often are less likely to keep secrets from parents, whereas adolescents who believe that religion is important are both less likely to lie to parents and keep secrets from parents. Being spiritual, but not religious, is not related to lying to parents or keeping secrets from parents. Results also suggest that primarily alcohol use, substance using peers, and morality mediate the effect of adolescent religiosity on lying to parents and keeping secrets from parents. Adolescents who attend religious services often and believe that religion is important are less likely to use alcohol, less likely to have friends that use substances, and are more likely to believe that moral rules should not be broken, which helps to explain why they are less likely to lie to parents and keep secrets from parents.",

      "title": "A comprehensive treatment service must include developmental, systemic and collaborative components",
      "abstract": "In the absence of a strong evidence base for treatment of eating disorders, it is inevitable that there will be disagreement about what is the most appropriate treatment service. Much of K. Halmi's overview of what constitutes such a service is helpful and uncontroversial. In this commentary, I will focus on what I believe to have been neglected, insufficiently acknowledged or out of keeping with contemporary views or practice. The first omission is that of a developmental focus. The peak age of onset of eating disorders is between 14 and 18, a time of considerable physical and psychological maturation. Increasingly pre-pubertal children are developing these disorders. The potential for physical decompensation is far greater in childhood and adolescence than in adults. Particular attention needs to be paid to bone growth, both linear and density, and to reproductive organ status, all of which are threatened by inadequate nutrition. Body mass index (BMI) per se is unhelpful, as it needs to be monitored according to age, using BMI centiles for age 1. Stipulating a specific BMI for under 18s, upon which decisions are made, is misleading. From a psychological perspective, developmental issues pay a vital part in the pathogenesis and maintenance of eating disorders and subsequently need to be central to assessment and treatment. Linked to this is the importance of a systemic perspective. Children and adolescents live with their families, attend school and are intensely involved with their peer group. The family history is far less important than parental management of the illness and the parents should always be included in both the treatment planning and its delivery. Indeed, family-based approaches to treatment for adolescent anorexia nervosa have a good evidence base and are central to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for its management 2. The multi-disciplinary team is, as Halmi suggests, an essential part of any treatment programme. However, Halmi makes no mention of nurses, who are central to the treatment on in-patient units and are often involved in day-care, out-patient clinics and home-based treatments. Her description of the ward milieu and physical structure of an inpatient unit emphasises “compliance”, with monitoring, controlling and restricting patient activities. Patient autonomy, privacy, comfort or rights receive virtually no attention. And there is no mention of some essential components of treatment, be that on an in- or out-patient basis: a) building a therapeutic alliance; b) skilled communication; c) empathic exploration of the patient's anxieties, concerns and cognitions; d) enhancing motivation — the unmotivated patient is far more likely to drop out of treatment 3. Halmi suggests that a cognitive behavioural approach within an in-patient unit is best. However, while there is good evidence for the value of cognitive behavioural therapy for bulimia nervosa, there is no evidence that it is of any value for patients with anorexia nervosa who are of low weight, i.e. the vast majority of patients admitted to hospital with an eating disorder. Turning to medical management, I disagree with Halmi's suggestion that in-patients should be weighed daily. Such an excessive pre-occupation with weight mirrors that of our patients and simply reinforces it 1. In any event, weight is not a valid indicator of physical well-being, for numerous reasons: a) weight varies by as much as 1.5 kg within any 24 hour period; b) the process of weighing is totally unreliable, given the fallibility of scales; c) weight can be easily falsified and many patients will do so to escape from a coercive treatment regimen; in contrast, some children and adolescents will avoid weight gain to ensure they are not discharged home to an abusive environment; d) what constitutes a satisfactory BMI for one person may be too high or too low for others, given the enormous variation in healthy BMI across the population. Weight/BMI should be but one measure of physical well-being and its unreliability acknowledged and allowed for. Weight might be measured on a regular basis, but it should never be the sole determinant of management decisions, and most certainly daily weighing should be avoided. If there is considerable anxiety about a patient's physical state, then vital signs and electrolyte status will provide far more valid and useful information. Halmi makes no reference to the exciting advances in our understanding of the neuroscience of eating disorders and their clinical applicability 4–6. A primary neurobiological basis for eating disorders is almost certain, given the neurotransmitter disturbances 7,8, the consistent and persisting abnormalities in very specific domains of neuropsychological functioning 9–13, and the specific, localized and persisting abnormalities on neuroimaging 5,14,15. The clinical implications are profound, pointing to the need for treatments targeted at the underlying neurobiological substrate. The use of cognitive remediation therapy is producing some impressive results, even in those with very long-standing illness, with symptomatic improvement in both symptoms and cognitive deficits 11,16. Finally, Halmi makes no mention of the importance of including high dependency and secure facilities for those whose eating disorders require far more intensive nursing than usual or whose behaviour is life threatening. The availability of step-down facilities, from secure/high dependency units, via specialized inpatient units and day care, to out-patient clinics and domiciliary care would make for a far more comprehensive service. A truly comprehensive service would need to have a full range of specialists, including nurses and therapists trained in motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive remediation therapy. The service would need to be clearly subdivided into two sections, one for children and adolescents, with an emphasis on developmental and systemic issues, and the other for adults. The ethos of this comprehensive service needs to be grounded, not in compliance, coercion and monitoring, but in the therapeutic alliance.",

      "title": "Social exclusion: Gendered experiences in the exclusive situations masked as inclusive and beyond",
      "abstract": "In the modern day, after a long history of reform, social exclusion seems to have decreased in certain areas, while in some areas, it is still rampant. Women, children, LGBTQ members, chronically ill as well as differently-abled people face social exclusion in various aspects. In this paper, I would like to focus on chronically ill or differently-abled people, and then further look into how gender inequalities play a role among chronically ill and differently abled people. In documents, as well as in appearance, these people are included in society, and in various social and institutional situations. However, reality is a bit different. Starting from schools to workplace to society to even certain family situations, they are excluded in many ways. Exclusions especially those on women, LGBTQ members, and other similarly marginalized people are irrational besides being problematic. Though some of the exclusions might be reasonable for certain groups of people like children or people with certain health conditions, but it seems that by excluding them from certain situations, and by doing it repeatedly, society develops a habit of excluding them from a lot of things, which are not only unnecessary, but also problematic. Society encourages this form of exclusion because it provides a false sense of superiority to the select ones included. These images of social exclusion, not only from certain activities, but from the status of an equal human reflect on the literature and the movies too. This exclusion is not only problematic in itself, but also has profound psychological effects on the excluded person or persons. Society, being phobic of differences, does not allow those people to be included in their core, who might threaten their homogeneity, or prove their existing habits, capabilities, and functions inadequate. The Covid-19 pandemic, affecting the whole world, without discrimination might have made it necessary to rethink inclusiveness and exclusiveness and their impacts on people. As social isolation became the norm, and the Covid-affected patients, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, were looked upon as taboos and were cornered besides being quarantined, it seemed fit to rethink what those people might go through who spend their entire lives feeling the same way covid patients felt in the early months of the pandemic.",

It is a time when individuals typically begin postsecondary education or a career, explore romantic relationships and marriage options, and develop a stable identity. For most, these pursuits foster new possibilities, but the lived experiences of traumatic events can derail these processes. Identity formation may be in flux, education, and work may be interrupted, and marriage may be delayed. However, several psychosocial factors have the potential to foster growth for emerging adult trauma survivors including cognitive processing of the trauma, identity development, event centrality, coping skills, and perceived and actual social support. Research indicates that through these factors growth can be realized, particularly in the PTG domains of personal strength and appreciation for life.",

Although few differences between adults from parentally‐divorced and intact family backgrounds persist when controls for contemporary life circumstances and other social background factors were included, two modest trends are still evident. First, although associations between psychological distress and early experience with parental divorce have weakened somewhat over the past two decades, coming from a non‐intact family of origin still has some significance for adult psychological well‐being. Second, men and women from non‐intact families of origin display different patterns of adjustment to and valuation of the major life roles of spouse and parent. Nevertheless, because such relationships are not very powerful, it is concluded that contrary to much of the literature and popular thought, these early experiences have, at most, a modest effect on adult adjustment.",

      "abstract": "People with cognitive disabilities are commonly positioned as risky sexual subjects. This article discusses the discursive production of sexual normates in the form of desirable and normative able-minded sexual subjects, in scientific research on the sexuality and cognitive disabilities of younger and older individuals (in particular those with dementia). We identify three interrelated discourses: regulating sexuality; fostering sexuality; and preserving sexuality. The first of these, regulation, pathologises sexuality of people with cognitive disabilities as faulty and in need of restriction. The second discourse, fostering, is more affirmative and argues for educating for a 'healthy' sexuality of people with cognitive disabilities, to mitigate risks of abuse. This discourse is more salient with younger people. The third discourse, preservation, in contrast, is more visible with older people with dementia and affirms sexuality so long as it is consistent with a 'genuine' or 'authentic' sexuality of the past. In conclusion, scientific research reinforces the cultural ideal of the rational and autonomous individual (and as such the mature/adult) capable of making independent decisions and engaging in healthy, good sex, based on stable sexual identities. Findings demonstrate how age intersects with cognitive ableism to intensify the cultural anxiety that exists around the sexualities of people with cognitive disabilities.",

The present study uses longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; 1998-2016) to consider linkages of parental death, social isolation, and health (self-rated health, functional limitations) for Black, Hispanic, and White older adults. Findings suggest that exposure to parental death before later life is associated with higher levels of isolation, greater odds of fair/poor self-rated health, and more functional limitations in later life. Moreover, social isolation partially explains associations between parental bereavement and later-life health. Racial disparities in bereavement are central to disadvantage: Black and Hispanic adults are more likely to experience parent death early in the life course and this differential exposure to bereavement has implications for racial and ethnic disparities in social isolation and health throughout life.",

      "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges of adolescence is constructing their self-identity. Teens between the ages of 13 and 21 are not only maturing physically, but they are also growing into their new role as adults. In order to do this, they need to answer for themselves the question \"Who am I?\" In traditional or particularly rigid communities or families, the young person may have very limited choices in who or what they become. This stage can often involve at least some delinquency, rebellion or acting-out of negative behaviors, and it will probably always include identity crisis and instabilation emotion. However, toward the end of this period, the young adult has usually settled on a clear and positive role for theirself. In maturity process, adolescents want to differentiate themselves from the others. They deliberately choose to be different and make different choices. Along with this, they begin to turn to their peers and friends, rather than their family, for their social and emotional needs. Peer pressure becomes a powerful force and, whether for good or bad, it can have a major impact on their behavior. However, to successfully pass this turning point, they must begin to define ideals and beliefs that will guide them to have a clear picture of how they want their lives to be. The role of communication in family becomes very important to guide the adolescent tobe a good young man with a good self-identity too.",

      "title": "Importance of intercultural paradigm in affirmative clinical practice with LGBTIQ+ people",
      "abstract": "Abstract Professionals’ attitudes, cultural background, and previous experiences are relatively stable and organized features of their backgrounds. They can affect the therapeutic process and provision of health care to LGBTIQ+ clients in both directions- affirmative and oppressive. Healthy development of sexual orientation and gender identity and their integration is one obvious prerequisite for healthy psycho-sexual and psychological development. Mental health care professionals should be aware of their attitudes, and cultural background, and how they can influence the therapeutic process with and provision of health care to LGBTIQ+ clients to provide culturally sensitive and LGBTIQ+ affirmative practice. LGBTIQ+ affirmative health care can include any single or combination of several social, psychological, behavioral, or medical interventions designed to support and affirm an individual’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Stigma-related stressors experienced by LGBTIQ+ people across these levels can take the form of relational trauma, and thus compound general life stressors that represent an additional risk for different stress-related outcomes including poor mental health and health-risk behaviors. Expectations of rejection might be particularly frequent experiences among transgender and gender-diverse people. Existing data depict LGBTIQ+ populations to be at a greater risk for poor health outcomes and a plethora of risk behaviors. Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people most often perceive available healthcare to be of inadequate quality and potentially unsafe. However, up to now healthcare systems across Europe fail to provide equal access for TGD compared to cisgender people It has been estimated that at least 27% of TGD people in Europe fail to access TGD care. Compared to cisgender people and compared to lesbian, gay, bisexual, or intersex people, TGD people are most affected by not having access to appropriate care, and they are among those reporting the highest rates of experiencing bad health. Access to the highest standard of LGBTIQ+ affirmative health care, including LGBTIQ+ affirmative approach within psychotherapeutic practice, that respects dignity and right of self-determination, personal, physical, and psychological integrity, autonomy, and wellbeing of LGBTIQ+ people, and that relies on evidence-based practice, clinical guidelines and standards of care should be a priority across European health care systems and psychotherapeutic modalities. Education and sensitization of medical, and mental health professionals, psychotherapists, and other health care professionals on sexuality, sexual orientations, gender identities, and diversities should be implemented as core intercultural competencies through the obligatory curriculum courses of health and mental health professionals.

The main problem is that there are no criminal provisions governing incest that are committed consensual in adulthood, so studies are needed to provide solutions in resolving cases that occur in the future. The results of this study are that the Criminal Code only regulates acts of sexual immorality against biological children, stepchildren, adopted children or children who are in their care with an element of coercion but does not regulate consensual sexual relations (incest) that is committed consensual at an adult age which has implications for law enforcement difficulties if this case happened. The regulation in the future is to stipulate incest which is done voluntarily at the age of adulthood as a crime.

E' infatti dovuta ai fattori socio\r\n culturali non propriamente positivi la presenza della maggior parte delle barriere che oggi impediscono la completa godibilita dell'ambiente (domestico e non) alla totalita delle persone.\r\n Chiaramente, il problema e di maturazione culturale, di avere la sensibilita non solo all'inserimento sociale dell' handicappato, ma anche di essere consapevoli dei diritto di questi a non subire discriminazioni legate al proprio stato. Nell'anno 2000 non e purtroppo difficile trovare sui quotidiani casi di intolleranza o di insofferenza verso queste persone: casi in cui, ad esempio, la persona handicappata, a causa dei parere contrario dei condominio, non riesce ad ottenere (od ottiene con grandi difficolta) l'installazione di un ascensore o di un servoscala, poiche rovinerebbe l'immagine, oppure casi di albergatori che non riescono a far occupare dalle persone senza disabilita fisiche le camere con bagni accessibili a tutti. Le stesse aziende produttrici fanno molta attenzione al modo in cui proporre prodotti accessibili a tutti paura di farli ricadere nella sottofascia per handicappati.\r\n E' pero altrettanto doveroso sottolineare come il diritto di fruire completamente dei luoghi e dei contesto in cui si vive, e espressamente previsto dall'ART. 3 della Costituzione della Repubblica Italiana, che recita: Tutti i cittadini hanno pari dignita sociale e sono eguali davanti alla legge, senza distinzioni di sesso, di razza, di lingua, di religione, di opinioni politiche, di condizioni personali e sociali.\r\n E' compito della repubblica rimuovere gli ostacoli di ordine economico e sociale, che limitando di fatto le liberta e l'eguaglianza dei cittadini, impediscono il pieno sviluppo della persona umana e l'effettiva partecipazione di tutti i lavoratori all'organizzazione politica, economica e sociale dei Paese. \r\n E' stata ritenuta utile una tesi di laurea su questo tema dopo aver riscontrato le grandi difficolta che i disabili devono superare nell'ambiente abitativo, sia quanto riguarda l'autonomia, sia la qualita della vita, in cui tutto e pensato unicamente con criteri ergonomici utenti non disabili.\r\n Gli ambienti domestici in cui si verificano le maggiori difficolta sono la cucina e il bagno. E' stato analizzato l'ambiente della cucina perche il bagno esistono diverse soluzioni progettuali.\r\n La tesi e stata sviluppata in due parti, una parte di ricerca, che ha fornito il sistema\r\n delle prestazioni richieste ed una di progetto, che ha soddisfatto le prestazioni\r\n richieste che si ritenevano prioritarie.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni richieste: sono state analizzate le esigenze emerse\r\n dall'intero sistema d'utenza e sono state illustrate tramite una sezione esplicativa\r\n accompagnata da degli elaborati grafici. In dettaglio:\r\n -Le complessita relative ai diversi tipi di utenza: l'utenza d'uso, di produzione, di\r\n gestione e sociale\r\n -Gli ausili necessari agli utenti disabili la deambulazione\r\n -I dati antropometrici degli utenti d'uso\r\n -Le tipologie ambientali ricorrenti in cucina\r\n -Le attrezzature indispensabili in cucina\r\n -Il lavoro che in cucina e necessario compiere durante la preparazione dei pasti.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite: il progetto\r\n -Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite si e tradotto, tramite alcuni elaborati grafici, in\r\n un prodotto di produzione industriale:\r\n una postazione che permette la preparazione dei cibi e il lavaggio delle\r\n stoviglie, con caratteristiche di flessibilita di installazione e di componenti,\r\n che permette l'utilizzo sia ad utenti disabili che ad utenti con mobilita non\r\n compromessa.\r\n Sulla base dei risultati della ricerca delle prestazioni richieste, eseguita nell'anno\r\n 1999, e stato sviluppato un progetto preliminare, costituito da elaborati grafici e\r\n tridimensionali che rappresentavano i vincoli e le prestazioni a cui il progetto doveva\r\n rispondere. Nel mese di gennaio 2000 e stato proposto a FRANKE S.p.A., nella\r\n persona dei Dott. Zeno Fontana, una collaborazione nello sviluppo industriale del\r\n progetto preliminare, che ha avuto la durata di circa un anno (gennaio- dicembre 2000) e che ha portato alla realizzazione di un prototipo ligneo in scala 1:1.",

      "title": "The Economy and Social Pathology",
      "abstract": "This review assesses the research of the past decade on how economic deprivation, prosperity, and change influence social pathology. Absolute economic deprivation is associated with high levels of psychological distress, some forms of psychoses, and interpersonal violence, although not with relatively minor forms of crime and neurosis. The mechanisms through which these disorders arise have not been isolated, however. Economic loss, particularly as a result of unemployment, is related to high rates of psychological distress and suicide but not to elevated amounts of psychoses or crime. Some research associates long-term rates of economic growth with rising levels of alcohol consumption, increased utilization of mental health facilities, and higher crime and imprisonment rates, but the reasons for these associations have not been established either. Finally, there is no reliable correlation between absolute rates of economic change and the incidence of any form of pathology. Studies suggest that the relationship between the economy and social pathology is mediated by a number of factors including the stage of the life cycle, gender, social class, levels of social support, and personality. Several promising directions for further research are indicated.",

      "abstract": "The lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population has been, and remains, disenfranchised in many ways. Despite increasing acceptance of sexual orientation, evidenced by recent strides in legalizing gay marriage in several states, LGBT people continue to have a higher prevalence of mental illness due to minority stress than heterosexuals. Factors such as stigma, prejudice, and discrimination lead to increased incidence of mental suffering as a result of stressful, hostile, and often unsafe environments. Prejudice within the LGBT community around race, gender, disability, or mental illness also exists. Transgender individuals have a high risk of being targeted for violence and hate crimes, harassment and discrimination, unemployment and underemployment, poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, suicide, and self-harm. The stressors that LGBT individuals face likely contribute to their disproportionate risk of contact with the criminal justice system beginning in adolescence and extending into adulthood. Transgender individuals in particular have a risk for incarceration, for reasons ranging from imprisonment based on gender identity expression alone to the need to earn money through the underground economy due to difficulty finding employment. In addition to homophobia and transphobia, LGBT individuals with mental illness experience further stigmatization. Clinicians need to understand the multiple stigmas that may affect an individual’s willingness to seek mental health care. The unique needs of incarcerated LGBT individuals with mental illness are often invisible, and generally misunderstood and underserved. This chapter seeks to add to the clinical knowledge of practitioners working with this population, to clarify legal precedent, and to establish best practices.",

Psykologiske og sociale årsager og følger.Only high degrees of obesity - above 3540% overweight - lead to impaired physical health and shortened life span. By contrast, detrimental psychological and social consequences of obesity make themselves felt already at the lowest grades of obesity. The somatic aspects of etiology and pathogenesis in obesity and its physical sequelae have received more attention and are better understood than the psychopathology pertaining to the obese state. No predominating, let alone specific, psychopathological profile characterizes obese persons. This is not surprising in view of their great number and of the many factors that may lead to a positive energy balance. On the other hand, psychological factors are more important in obesity than in most other disorders. In the present review of the psychological and social aspects of obesity it is attempted to separate causes from consequences. Mention is made of the psychological events, causative or reactive, that take place in the obese individual, and of the attitude of society to obesity. Important elements of this systematisation are: psychogenesis in the individual, psychogenesis originating from others, prejudice, discrimination and stigmatisation, self derogation, body image disturbance, reaction to dieting and quality of life before and after weight loss.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly Americans who live with people under age 18 have lower life evaluations than those who do not. They also experience worse emotional outcomes, including less happiness and enjoyment, and more stress, worry, and anger. In part, these negative outcomes come from selection into living with a child, especially selection on poor health, which is associated with worse outcomes irrespective of living conditions. Even with controls, the elderly who live with children do worse. This is in sharp contrast to younger adults who live with children, likely their own, whose life evaluation is no different in the presence of the child once background conditions are controlled for. Parents, like elders, have enhanced negative emotions in the presence of a child, but unlike elders, also have enhanced positive emotions. In parts of the world where fertility rates are higher, the elderly do not appear to have lower life evaluations when they live with children; such living arrangements are more usual, and the selection into them is less negative. They also share with younger adults the enhanced positive and negative emotions that come with children. The misery of the elderly living with children is one of the prices of the demographic transition.",

The sibling pairs came from large families with a median of six children; 45 pairs came from Mexican-American families. The median age of both addicts and brothers was 39. One-third of both addicts and brothers lost a parent before age 16. The addicts showed early deviant behavior preceding heroin use in contrast to the socially conforming behavior of the brothers. Noteworthy discrepancies appeared in the retrospective explanations offered by the addicts and the brothers of conditions leading to addiction in one and abstinence in the other. The addicts attributed the addiction versus abstinence primarily to association with different peer groups; the brothers cited this difference, but also frequently cited personality differences and other differences, thus giving more complex explanations. As adults the addicts showed gross social impairment on dimensions of employment, criminal record, marital adjustment, and other life activities. The brothers, in contrast, seemed socially competent, but they nonetheless showed evidence of some impairment: 40% were arrested one or more times, and 50% had histories of alcohol abuse. Apparently the brothers did not entirely escape the adverse early environments which shaped the careers of the addicts.",

Currently, the major forms of child abuse are acknowledged as being physical abuse or non-accidental physical injury; sexual abuse and exploitation; emotional/psychological abuse and neglect. These forms of maltreatment often convey an implied message of non-accidental or committed harm against children. Abuse, however, can often occur by neglect or a failure to protect children, and therefore can be characterised as abuse by ommission. Many practitioners and professionals now use the term 'child abuse and neglect' rather than the single 'child abuse' term.",

      "abstract": "By far, most research on the behavior of socially anxious individuals has focused on the \"flight\" rather than the \"fight\" response described in the traditional conceptualization of anxiety. More recently, however, there has been some speculation and emerging evidence suggesting that social anxiety and aggression may be related. The present study examined social anxiety as a predictor of dating aggression within a late adolescent sample. Two forms of dating aggression were assessed: physical aggression, such as slapping, use of a weapon, or forced sexual activity, and psychological aggression, such as slamming doors, insulting, or refusing to talk to one's partner. One aspect of social anxiety, Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), emerged as a significant predictor of male dating aggression, even after controlling for relationship quality. Notably, FNE was most predictive of increased aggression of both types when men also perceived their romantic relationship to be more antagonistic. Despite its demonstrated importance as a contextual variable, however, relationship quality did not mediate the association between FNE and psychological or physical aggression. Implications for prevailing conceptualizations of social anxiety and dating aggression are discussed.",

      "title": "AYRIMCILIĞIN KAVRAMSAL ANALİZİ",
      "abstract": "“Discrimination” is a concept which has been discussed by different sides of the society throughout the history and which still keeps its importance and will do in future, as well. The word “discrimination” originates from the latin word “discriminare” which means “separate” or “divide”. The major thing which is emphasized in definitions concerning discrimination is the negative categorization of the individual or the groups in the society, the negative categorization of the individuals with the reasons which are not found reasonable and discourse and actions that are parallel to the reasons. The conceptual analysis means to indicate its compounds and indicators. The compounds of discrimination are “prejudice”, “dogma” and “benefit”. (i) Prejudice. Prejudice is described as “the negative approach”, which are usually known as unbased, discriminative and intolerant, towards a group of people or singular members of the group as a consequence of missing or mistaken judgment. Therefore, prejudice makes up the fundamentals of discrimination. Individuals may tend to adopt discrimination as spiritual concept without considering the prejudice that sometimes they are not aware to obtain or they are never aware. (ii) Dogma. On the other hand, the term “dogma” is described as the thought whose credibility is absolutely accepted without all kinds of examination and criticize. The dogmas that are based on believing without any examination are one of the major compounds of discrimination. Dogma may also result is not using the logic because it cancels the functioning of human mind and so it may make human beings more prone to acceptations. (ii) Benefit. Meanwhile, the term “benefit” is considered negatively in language and so it is not seen in the first common place in interaction of us and this case is often underlined. Because consideration of benefit is invariably evaluated as a negative factor in interactive relations of people. Individuals or group members may tend to make discriminations because they consider their own benefits and moreover they are aware or not aware of it. The major indicators of discrimination is “hate speech”, “applications of violence” and “favoritism”. (i) Hate speech. Hate speech is the violation of right to life. That’s why, we notice that “the hate speech” points to inequality and rejects the concerned individual or the group and insults some parts or groups in the society and feeds the prejudice. The speech of hate which is a major indicator of discrimination may result in the violence by leading to physically, performance of hate crimes which is mainly based on hate speech. (ii) Applications of violence. In descriptions concerning violence over an individual or the society, physical power, brutal force for bad purposes and the harm of people who are exposed to violence and any kind of morally and financially negative factors concerning the physical and spiritual well-being. One of the major reasons of the violence over an individual or a group is the discrimination. Violence which is also expression of the discrimination may result in irrevocable harm in individuals in terms of emotional and social points as well as being considered a “crime” in law. (iii) Favoritism. The term “favoritism” which also refers to “lookout” backing up refers to supporting someone without considering the law and social rules to give priority unjustly in a subject. Favoritism is also classified in four major groups known as “nepotism”, “kronizm”, “partisanship” and “gender discrimination”. For this reason, favoritism threats the individuals, organizations and the society by means of corruption. Therefore, favoritism with is negative effects and so it seems inevitable that favoritism should be prevented by means of legal measures due to its negative effects over individuals, organizations and the society. Despite the negative effects of favoritism over the individual(s), organization(s) and the society, it has almost become an everyday factor and this assumption has gradually enlarged in the society. One of the major indicators of discrimination is favoritism that the individual(s), right(s) are grasped and it is considered one of the most critical reasons for the social corruption. In this respect, favoritism should be regarded as a major concrete evidence discrimination, as well. In other words, favoritism is that discrimination for individual(s) turns out to be a physically visible factor as back-up or support.",

International inertia is compounded as not only torture, but also ‘other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ is prohibited. Some of these occur in the private sphere, which traditionalists erroneously assume outside of international human rights law. Children may also be unprotected because they suffer from trauma in different ways from adults. Jurisprudence of human rights fora based principally on adult victims, despite some dicta to the contrary, risks international standards being inappropriately applied to child victims.

      "title": "The relation of balance performance and balance confidence with physical activity in elderly fallers and non-fallers",
      "abstract": "Balance is an important issue in aging research since it is undoubtedly linked with motor performance affecting, thus, activities of daily living and consecutively the quality of life in the elderly. Maintenance of good balance ability reduces the chance of a fall which, especially in the elderly, is not only an important predictor of mortality but also a major problem with important negative health and socio-economic consequences. The fear of falling, on the other hand, results in restrictions of physical activity, functional ability, and consequently may lead to reduced quality of life and adverse health consequences [5]. Another psychological variable linked to the fear of falling is balance confidence or falls self-efficacy, which refers to personal beliefs in one’s ability to engage in certain activities of daily living without falling or losing balance [8]. Increased balance confidence, which is determined to a great extent by balance performance [2], is associated with lower fear of falling and better functional ability [6]. Physical activity seems to have a positive relation with balance confidence but the outcomes of this relation are not well understood. Some findings suggest that the improvement in balance confidence through an exercise intervention program is only weakly correlated with improved general physical function and not associated with improvements in postural stability [7]. Other findings, however, suggest that balance confidence plays a mediatory role in the effects of fear of falling on functional outcomes [6], and if the exercise program is aimed at the enhancement of balance confidence then the fear of falling is likely to be reduced [4]. Balance confidence and balance performance have been found to be significant predictors of fall status [3]. It is not, known however, if the relationship between balance confidence, balance performance and habitual physical activity, is different in fallers than in nonfallers. This study aimed to examine the relationship between balance performance, balance confidence and physical activity, which is reflected in the number of steps performed in everyday life, taking into account the fall history of elderly persons.",

      "title": "Sylvia Plath and Sheila Ballantyne's Imaginary Crimes",
      "abstract": "27 SYLVIA PLATH AND SHEILA BALLANTYNE'S IMAGINARY CRIMES Mary G. De Jong* Conventional wisdom has it that a son needs to \"kill\" his father in order to become a man. He does so, the story goes, by asserting his own identity and prerogatives as a male and making his own mark in the world. It is less readily perceived and admitted that a daughter's quest for adult identity is also likely to entail a form ofpatricide. Because gender is a major organizing construct of patriarchal society, a maturing daughter can neither acquire male power nor assert independence from it on the son's model. Socialized to reproduce the mother, not to replace the father, she has little cultural sanction for self-defining and self-reliant behavior.1 On the contrary, the daughter is conditioned to look to her father, and men generally, for love, protection, and financial support, which are contingent on male approbation. Claiming the right to set her own value jeopardizes paternalistic approval and educes anxiety and guilt, as the life stories of Catharine Beecher, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Mary Ann Evans, Virginia Woolf, Adrienne Rich, and other literary women attest. In the late twentieth century, with \"the return of father to literature,\" non-fictional presentations of fathers from their daughters' perspectives are still relatively rare and written under taboo: daughters feel disloyal, unfemininely critical, and frightened when writing what they know about their fathers.2 Since published narratives, like cultural myths, shape women's visions of what they can be and do,3 stories of daughters separating from their fathers should be told in private journals and personal conversations and in autobiographies, fiction, and poetry. The cultural restraints on women's construction of cross-gender and cross-generational conflict must be broken, for daughters must confront their need to \"kill\" fathers who obstruct the process of self-definition. Sylvia Plath and Sheila Ballantyne have portrayed the daughter's struggle to claim an identity of her own. The protagonist-narrator of Ballantyne's Imaginary Crimes (1982), like the speaker of Plath's \"Daddy,\" reveals in her act of writing a compulsion to rid herself of her father's influence. In both cases, the father withheld something that the daughter needed, and he died without settling accounts with her. Neither can know herself as a responsible adult as long as \"Daddy\" is within her, hot-wiring ambivalent impulses: resentment at his desertion, a'Mary G. De Jong teaches in the Department of English at Pennsylvania State University. She has published articles on Nathaniel Hawthorne and George Eliot and is currently writing a book about nineteenth-century women writers of religious poetry. 28Mary G. De Jong coupled with an uncomfortable notion that she might have repudiated him first (\"You died before I had time,\" Plath's speaker declares); a need for autonomy, intermittently short-circuited by terror of taking responsibility for herself; outraged innocence at odds with the suspicion that she does not deserve the love she craves. However deeply buried the father may be—in the earth, in her mind, in her \"pretty red heart\"—he remains a dominating presence from which she must free herself to get on with her own life.4 For Plath's speaker and Ballantyne's protagonist, testifying to their love twisted together with rage is like performing an exorcism. Working themselves up to \"kill\" (cast off and disown) the father, they use the same historical and analytical methods: tracing his dark origins and recounting his crimes against humanity, thus to legitimate their efforts to create a new sense of self by ripping out old connections to a father they cannot simply forget. Plath's most famous poem about a dangerously seductive father was probably a source for Imaginary Crimes. Not only do the protagonists face the same psychological crux, there are also suggestive likenesses in the father-figures and the powers their daughters attribute to them. The mythic German Daddy of Plath's poem is a Nazi-Fascist victimizer of his daughter, of Jews, of innocents generally. Searching for the source of his capacity for destruction, the speaker studies her one photograph of him. But it yields nothing new: the pedagogue stands...",

      "title": "Problems and Challenges during Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is the period of psychological and social transition between childhood and adulthood. It is derived from the latin verb, 'adoare' meaning 'to grow up'. It spans from thirteen to nineteen years. The ages of adolescence vary by culture. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. In contrast, in the United States, adolescence is generally considered to begin somewhere between ages 12 and 14, and end at 19 or 20. As a transitional stage of human development it represents the period of time during which a juvenile matures into adulthood. Hall, G. H. (1904), denoted this period as one of 'storm and stress.' The time is identified with dramatic biological development and psychosocial development along with development in a person's thinking and behaviours. With the onset of adolescence, children usually complete elementary school and enter secondary education, such as middle school or high school. During this period of life, most children go through the physical stage of puberty which often begins between the ages of nine and thirteen. The physical changes that herald adolescence are the development of breasts and first menstrual periods for girls, the deepening voices and broadening shoulders for boys. Their developing brains bring new cognitive skills that enhance their ability to reason and to think abstractly. They develop emotionally, establishing a new sense of who they are and who they want to become. Their social development involves relating in new ways both to peers and adults. And, they begin to experiment with new behaviours as they transit from childhood to adulthood. Many adolescents today, are not provided with adequate opportunities and support to become competent adults (Hamburg & Hamburg, 2004; Pittman & Diversi, 2003). Today's adolescents are presented with a less stable environment than adolescents of a decade or two ago. High divorce rates, high adolescent pregnancy rates, and increased geographic mobility of families contribute to this lack of stability in adolescents' lives.Today's adolescents are exposed to a complex menu of lifestyle options through the media. They face these temptations, as well as sexual activity, at increasingly young ages (Larson & Wilson, 2004). They have to deal with a constant battle between the privileges and enjoyments of youth, and the responsibilities of adulthood.Problems in adolescenceAdolescence could be a period of great challenge and confusion in a child's life. It is not a time of rebellion, crisis, pathology, and deviance. A far more accurate vision of adolescence is of a time of evaluation, of decision making, of commitment, of carving out a place in the world. Adolescents witness several problems related to different spheres of life. Some main problems faced by them are as follows:School Failure and Dropping Out: There is a constellation of causes for youth's dropping out of school or underachieving. Socioeconomic factors, racial and ethnic prejudice and discrimination, family background, parental influence and relationships, home responsibilities, personality problems, social maladjustment, poverty, health problems, marriage, pregnancy or problems with the English language, intellectual difficulties or misconduct, expulsion, low marks, and lack of interest in school are all important factors. Some leave for economic reasons, needing to support themselves or their families (Christie, Jolivette, & Nelson, 2007; Lessard et al., 2008; Verdugo, 2011).Dropouts are more likely to be emotionally immature and less well adjusted. They may manifest symptoms of defective ego functioning, rebellion, negativism and alienation, hostility and resentment, feeling of inferiority and low self-esteem, excessive fear and anxiety and emotional instability. Dropout rates differ according to gender and ethnicity. Males are more likely than females to drop out of school. …",

Thus, Piaget's theory differs, on the one hand, from neonativist and other theories that see development as fundamentally a phenomenon of early childhood, and on the other hand from lifespan theories that see development as continuing inexorably through adulthood.

      "abstract": "Based on the Handicaps-Incapacites-Dependance survey, this article looks at the \nrelevance of two categories considered separately by social policies: disabled \npeople and dependent elderly people. It shows that to these two categories \ncorrespond different types of care: exclusively family care for the former, and at \nleast partly professional care for the latter. However, these two categories do not \nfully cover the variety of situations of people living at home after age 50.

That weakens the assumption of a homogenisation of life \nsituations, covered by the category “elderly dependent people”. The study shows, \non the contrary, that, at a given age, the life situations of ageing people remain \nhighly varied. Disabled people and dependent elderly people, statistically in the \nminority in the sample, are in some ways closer to each other (in their use of human \ncare) than people, in the majority in the sample, who manage, through routines or \ntechnical assistance, to do without human care.",

      "abstract": "Reproductive justice refers to three primary principles: the right not to have a child, the right to have a child, and the right to parent children in safe and healthy environments. It depends upon the adoption and enactment of a human rights framework, including both negative rights (e.g., governments must not interfere with people's autonomy) and positive rights (e.g., governments must ensure that people can exercise their rights and freedom and live with dignity). The term is preferred by many because it merges support for reproductive rights with broader movements for social justice. Lack of control over one's body and an inability to make decisions about one's destiny can have lasting impacts on women's physical and mental health and well-being, and have been associated with shame, depression, anxiety, anger, trauma, poor body image, low self-esteem, and low self-worth. Reproductive injustice increases women's morbidity and mortality risks, and it makes it difficult for them to provide a safe, healthy, and loving environment for their children. This chapter explores four themes based on psychological theory and research – poverty, access to education, access to health care services and supplies, culture – that impact reproductive health (e.g., preconception health, maternal care, maternal and infant mortality, abortion).",

      "abstract": "Abstract The importance of assessing individuals in a marital conflict is seen as vital. The theoretical position that there are big ‘T’ and little ‘t’ individuals indicated that some members of the relationship are more eager for thrill seeking and being outgoing while little ‘t’ individuals are more eager for harmony and conservative personality traits. This has long been established. There are extremes of this but also these traits are on a continuum. While opposites attract in a relationship, the more individuals have in common, the more likely the marital relationship will work except in one area, that of seeking control or dominance. Here, opposites are likely to be more successful. Areas where there are likely to be difficulties between big ‘T’ and little ‘t’ individuals are in the rates of infidelity where big T's may predominate, also in sexual dissatisfaction and problems, attitudes to love, marital abuse and spouse abuse, child rearing issues, drug and alcohol abuse, the handling of money, household chores and division of labour, recreation interests, and religious differences. While not all of these may come into conflict or may be part of a big ‘T’ or little ‘t’ personality, there is a weighing in one direction rather than in the other. In order for rehabilitation between marital partners, it is important for each to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the other's personality, be they big ‘T’ or little ‘t’ individuals. Approaches by counsellors, psychologists to these individual differences are discussed.",

      "abstract": "English: Loneliness is currently regarded as one of the most common and widespread problems experienced by human beings, and it is also observed as a painful, unpleasant and negative experience. The term loneliness might conjure up an image of an elderly person, alone and isolated. It is a concern, however, that this complex phenomenon occurs to a great extent during adolescence. Reasons for this might be that adolescence is a developing period of transition between childhood and adulthood that brings with it more social changes, such as leaving home, to live by oneself, to attend university or to start a career.\r\nOn the other hand morality entails the principles or ideals of a group that enable them to distinguish between right and wrong according to the viewpoint of the group concerned, and to behave accordingly. Moral development is thus the process whereby individuals learn principles to enable them to distinguish between behaviour that is right and other behaviour which should be regarded as wrong. The individual is then capable of directing his own behaviour in terms of these principles.\r\nAdolescents daily face various confrontations. Each day they have to make moral decisions: should they act according to their own ideals or should they compromise. In this sense, idealism implies to act morally and not to succumb to wrong temptations. Similarly, adolescents have to confront the complex phenomenon of loneliness daily. Thus loneliness and morality are two important behavioural aspects that manifest during adolescence. The question is whether morality could foretell loneliness. The researcher wished to establish a relationship between loneliness and morality for a better understanding of loneliness.\r\nIn view of the above, the main objective of the study was to establish the perception of adolescents of different cultures regarding loneliness and morality and to investigate the relationship between loneliness and morality. It was also determined which of the independent variables, namely morality, gender, age, mother tongue and ethnicity, contributed significantly to the prediction of loneliness. A further objective was to determine any difference regarding loneliness and morality as perceived by different culture groups.\r\nThe following hypotheses were formulated for this research:\r\nHypothesis 1: The main hypothesis was that a linear correlation between the loneliness of an adolescent and a number of independent variables namely morality, gender, age, mother tongue and ethnicity were present.\r\nHypothesis 2: There were differences between the different levels of the independent variables namely gender, age, mother tongue and ethnicity as far as loneliness and morality are concerned.\r\nThe researcher used ex post facto research and more specifically a criterion group design. In this criterion group design, samples which represent the different levels of the independent variables were selected randomly from the population.\r\nA total of 714 adolescents from three different secondary schools in the greater Bloemfontein between the ages of 13 and 17 were selected. Adolescents were used because they are increasingly being confronted with moral issues and because loneliness occurs more commonly during adolescence. The focus was on three ethnic groups namely coloured, black and white adolescents.\r\nThree different questionnaires, namely the Le Roux Loneliness Scale, the Morally Debatable Behaviours Scale and a Biographical questionnaire were applied to obtain the necessary data.\r\nThe results were as follows:\r\n-A significant inverse correlation between loneliness and morality was determined, while morality was identified as the best predictor of loneliness. According to the results adolescents with low moral values were more lonely than adolescents with high moral values. This is a new finding and merits further investigation.\r\n-Age was also identified as a main predictor of loneliness. Older adolescents were significantly more inclined to experience loneliness while younger adolescents were less inclined to loneliness.\r\n-It was also found that culture was an important variable in the study of loneliness. Black adolescents were significantly more inclined to loneliness than white and coloured adolescents.\r\nThis research confirms that loneliness is a complex and disturbing phenomenon that appears more commonly during adolescence. Since these are new findings more research is merited.",

There are differences in how a person of twenty-five years versus one of sixty-five years mediates a dispute, trains to run a marathon, or walks into a dance club. Completing a graduate degree versus dropping out of high school affects the opportunities a person has when applying for a job or running for office. Identifying as a woman, a man, or neither will affect a person’s experience of serving in the military, seeking a job promotion, or being the primary caregiver for young children (at least in many locales). Most of these variations in experience have little to do with persons’ biological differences. Instead, they grow out of social environments and others’ expectations. To the identifiers of age, education, and gender suggested above, we can add race, disability, immigrant status, sexual orientation, and other markers of identity. And it is the intersection of those multiple various aspects of a person’s identity, combined with personal choices and life experiences, that make each person distinctive and shape each person’s experience.",

      "title": "Friendship and aggressiveness as determinants of conflict outcomes in middle childhood.",
      "abstract": "The attributions and responses of aggressive and nonaggressive boys to ambiguously intended actions of friends and nonfriends were examined. Thirty-seven aggressive and 37 nonaggressive third- and fifth-grade boys were presented with descriptions of encounters between peers in which child experienced a negative outcome as the result of the ambiguously intended actions of another. Neither aggressive nor nonaggressive subjects were influenced by the presence or absence of friendship between themselves and the child whose behavior they were asked to interpret or respond to. Aggressive subjects attributed more hostile intent than nonaggressive subjects when the objectionable action was directed at themselves but not when directed at others. Both groups of subjects predicted less hostile responses by themselves than by others. Although a significant degree of consistency was found between subjects' attributions and responses, it was also true that most hostile responses were predicted following nonhostile attributions. This finding is inconsistent with an attributionally based explanation of hostile reactive behavior. Conflict between peers is a fact of life throughout childhood. It occurs among children of both sexes, between friends and nonfriends alike, whenever one person does something to which a second person objects (Hay, 1984, p. 2). Denned in this way, conflict entails a dyadic exchange in which the actions of child are met with opposition by another. The first child need not have intended to offend the second for conflict to arise. However, if offense is intended, but none is taken, no conflict can be said to exist. Thus, an oppositional or antagonistic response by the offended party is a denning feature of conflict (Shantz, 1987). When a potential conflict situation occurs, a child's interpretation of that situation, particularly the intention that he or she attributes to the other child involved, has been shown to be important in determining the child's response (Darley, Klosson, & Zanna, 1978; Dodge, Pettit, McClaskey, & Brown, 1986; Mallick & McCandless, 1966; Rule, Nesdale, & McAra, 1974). If the child has a negative experience and believes that the other individual acted with hostile intent, then he or she is likely to respond with hostility. In contrast, if the child views the responsible peer as having acted benignly, a nonhostile response is more likely to result.",

      "abstract": "The role of power in healthcare can raise many ethical challenges. Power is ownership, whether given, ceded, or taken of another person’s autonomy. When a person has power over someone else, they can control or strongly influence the decision-making freedom of that person. From the principalist perspective 1,2 of healthcare ethics, denying a person their freedom to choose, should only occur when justifying conditions related to beneficence and nonmaleficence are sufficiently satisfied. In healthcare, it is rare to be able to identify situations where paternalism is justified. However, experience suggests that abusive power in healthcare is used too frequently without justifying criteria.",

In the 1970s there was a proliferation of literature reifying the concept of life events and relating it to various illnesses and conditions. The hypothesis implicit in most of the life events literature is that, under the impact of a certain number of stressful life events, the organism succumbs to certain diseases or conditions such as heart disease or clinical depression. Protective factors such as having the support of a loving and understanding relationship are clearly important when coping with stressful life events such as loss and bereavement. The whole process of changing drinking behaviour and life-style is likely to affect the occurrence of negative and positive events of the implicated type, such as events surrounding relationships, work, physical health or finances.",

However, in certain situations he/she can be exempted from his/her actions, especially in a situation whereby he/she cannot differentiate in right and wrong due to his/her mental incapability. In the modern era, ample development has been gained in the field of mental health and an effective mechanism has been provided as to observe and implement the principles of responsibility between crime and mental illness. Schizophrenia has been commonly referred as severe cognitive and affective deficits that heavily influence empathy, understanding, reason and decision making, but also control of compulsiveness. Although there is relation between mental illness and lacks or decrease of legal accountability, their relationship is also bound by social, cultural, demographic, developmental, and clinical factors. For criminal liability both mens rea and actus reus are important ingredients. However, in case of Schizophrenia the element of mens rea is missing, which exempt the mentally ill person from the consequences of crime. A qualitative method of research is conducted to evaluate the criminal responsibility of a mentally ill patient. Upon observation, it has been discovered that laws related to mental health in Pakistan lacks compatibility with international conventions and Islamic law, so there is a dire need to revamp the existing legislation and a phenomenon of non-responsibility of a mentally ill patient should be followed as a paradigm shift.",

      "title": "Experiences of, and attitudes, towards growing up and adulthood: a comparative study of young people with and without mild intellectual disabilities",
      "abstract": "To some extent, ‘adulthood’ and ‘adult identity’ can be thought of as socially constructed phenomena, capable of evolving in response to societal consensus. For many typically developing young adults, the period that encompasses the transition to adulthood is thought to be elongating. In many ways, the traditional pathways to adulthood have eroded, leaving many young people feeling ambivalent about the process of growing up. Due to a combination of social and economic pressures and ideological shifts, young people are becoming increasingly likely to delay certain social role transitions, most notably marriage and parenthood, until their mid to late twenties and early thirties. Subjective adult identity, or feeling like an adult, is also thought to be taking longer to develop. \r\nFor young adults with mild intellectual disabilities and their families, however, the transition to adulthood stands to be even more complicated. Developmental delay and difficulties adapting to change can have the potential to make service transitions harder to adjust to. These experiences might also be exacerbated by the fact that options for purposeful daytime activity can be limited for members of this population. Moreover, pervasive narratives of risk and vulnerability necessarily compete with a number of the normative outcomes of transition, most notably the development of self-determination and independence. Concerns about safety and security may therefore prevent parents and service providers from providing opportunities for positive risk-taking and experimentation. This is even though such experiences can make vital contributions to personal development and maturation. \r\nThrough strategies such as Keys to Life and More Choice, More Chances, the Scottish Government has committed itself to help all young people to achieve positive transition outcomes. However, to date, there has been very little research undertaken to find out how young people with and without mild intellectual disabilities think and feel about the transition to adulthood, including their attitudes towards self-determination, independence, and autonomy. This thesis aimed to address this gap in the research by investigating young Scots’ and their parents’ experiences of, and attitudes towards growing up and adulthood. \r\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, including semi-structured interviews, interactive flashcard activities, a vignette, and a questionnaire, data from over 100 participants have been collected and analysed. Our findings suggest that, despite high variation in the levels of autonomy experienced by the participants, young people with and without mild intellectual disabilities share complicated feelings towards the prospect of increased independence. Both groups, for example, hoped to work towards independence, albeit over different time frames, yet also voiced a degree of reluctance to adopt additional responsibility at home. The desire for an ‘easy life’, for example, appeared to be present in both groups, though genuine concerns about coping without support were more prevalent in the group with mild intellectual disabilities. Similarly, while attitudes towards parental support and interference were mostly positive in both groups, the majority of participants suggested that they would resist interference in personal, or private domains. However, there was some evidence to suggest that the young people with intellectual disabilities perceived the balance of power within their own families as more skewed towards their parents. \r\nWith regards to the nature of adulthood and adult identity, our findings corroborate previous claims that individuals conceptualise adulthood in ways that are relevant and achievable to themselves. We found tentative evidence, for example, that the young adults with intellectual disabilities may prioritise interpersonal dimensions of ‘responsibility’ - such as looking after other people and fulfilling one’s familial obligations - as being the most salient criteria for adulthood. In contrast, the typically developing participants appeared to focus on more individualistic expressions of responsibility, such as self-sufficiency, personal responsibility, and independent decision-making. \r\nThough speculative, our findings demonstrate that individuals with intellectual disabilities can have unique perspectives on universal phenomena that are not only interesting in their own right but may also have consequences for the broader literature. The implications of these findings for policy and practice are also outlined, as well as opportunities for future research.",

      "abstract": "It is a sad truism that there is nothing that people will not do to other people. This may be at the individual level, as with the psychopathic serial murderer, but it is particularly the case with regard to collective behaviour. This can occur in groups, institutions and organizations driven by ideology, patriotism, extreme belief in a leader, kinship or clanship, by racial hatred or by religious fanaticism. People become absorbed in the group and, within its solidarity, restraints are removed and they commit acts they would almost certainly never contemplate doing as individuals. To a degree then, the organization or collective is complicit. Indeed, I argue that there is ample evidence to support the contention that ‘organizations kill’. In essence, I will maintain that there are no ‘individuals’ in organizations and that organizations commit ‘crimes’. This draws attention to the social-psychology of ‘deviant’ behaviour in organizations and I will lilustrate this with regard to policing and the business corporation. And in relation to the latter, I will argue that the law seems unable, or unwilling, to tackle the issue of corporate blame. It remains fixated on the individual and the organization too often manoeuvres successfully to evade the criminal label.",

Other psychosocial risk factors are related to low socioeconomic status (due to increased exposure to precarious conditions because, although there are no significant differ ences between socioeconomic strata, people from the lowest levels have more severe depression), unemployment (especially men), social isolation, legal problems, experiences of violence, substance abuse and migration. Thus, in general, it seems that women’s mental health is more vulnerable to be affected by certain social factors; however, it is also likely that men underreport mental health problems because of their difficulty to seek help if any emo tional distress afflicts them. Likewise, it has been noted that depression in men can be “hidden” behind addictive and risk behaviors as well as behind irritability and impulsivity. 7",

      "title": "1.O. Scientific session: Trans &amp; Gender-Diverse Individuals’ Mental &amp; Behavioral Health Risks &amp; Intervention Needs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals are at a greater risk for various poor mental and behavioral health outcomes than cisgender individuals, including higher rates of suicide, psychiatric diagnoses, and behavioral health problems. For example, research has documented a seven-fold increased risk for lifetime suicide attempts among young TGD people, compared with the general population. Less is known about the age of onset of such mental and behavioral health disparities and how these disparities may vary across other intersectional socio-demographic variables. It has been well-documented that trans and gender-diverse individuals often encounter discrimination and transphobia across various social, educational, professional, administrative, and healthcare settings. This discrimination, as highlighted in the literature, frequently poses obstacles to accessing both general and trans-specific healthcare services due to experiences of discrimination (e.g., misgendering, refusal of care, lack of adequate services). The right and ability to self-determine and the accessibility to gender-affirming care without discrimination are key to closing the gap in TGD individuals’ mental and behavioral health outcomes, and for them to live authentically and thrive. Tailored and affirming mental and behavioral health interventions to reduce these health inequities are pivotal for TGD individuals to achieve the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health: a key fundamental human right. Considerable gaps in the literature remain concerning the onset and determinants of gender identity-based health disparities and healthcare approaches that are respectful, inclusive, non-pathologizing, and grounded in human rights principles for TGD individuals. This workshop intends to address these knowledge gaps by delving into the mental and behavioral health needs of TGD individuals. The workshop seeks to further foster dialogue on strategies to overcome resistance to implementing approaches that uphold the human rights and well-being of these communities. Dr. Richard Bränström (Karolinska Institutet) will present a study that explores the age at which gender identity-based disparities in psychiatric diagnoses and treatment can be first identified. Dr. Gonzales (Vanderbilt University) will examine disparities in mental health and social determinants of health among TGD individuals with private insurance. Dr. Moleiro (Lisbon University Institute) will review TGD persons’ ways of identifying with the choices and trajectories in social, legal, and affirmative healthcare processes in Portugal. Dr. Lelutiu-Weinberger (Columbia University School of Nursing) will present findings from a study that assessed tobacco use and cessation attitudes, facilitators, and barriers to quitting, and intervention components and delivery modality acceptability among TGD individuals, as well as sexual minority individuals, in Romania to inform a tailored and affirming smoking cessation intervention. Key messages • Transgender and gender-diverse are at increased risk for a variety of poor mental and behavioral health compared with the general public. • There is a critical need to foster healthcare services for transgender and gender-diverse individuals that are tailored and affirming.",

After controlling for credit score, credit history, income, employment status, and homeownership, personal characteristics like beauty, race, appearing creditworthy, being overweight, or the context of the picture a borrower posts significantly affect the likelihood of getting a loan and/or the interest rate paid. Beautiful borrowers are 1.41 percent more likely to get a loan and pay 81 basis points less than an average-looking borrower with the same credentials. Black borrowers pay between 139 and 146 basis points more than an otherwise similar White borrower. The borrower's personal characteristics do not appear to be significantly related to subsequent delinquency rates, with the exception of beauty that, all else equal, makes a borrower more than three times as likely to become delinquent. I also find that lenders' sophistication and personal characteristics such as gender, race, age and income affect their lending decisions. Similarity between borrowers and lenders also has a statistically significant and large economic effect on the terms of the loan, although it doesn't change the impact of the other explanatory variables. The setting of the study is a large U.S. online lending website.",

In this article, by contrast, we examine aggression from a social network perspective, arguing that social network centrality, our primary measure of peer status, increases the capacity for aggression and that competition to gain or maintain status motivates its use. We test these arguments using a unique longitudinal dataset that enables separate consideration of same- and cross-gender aggression. We find that aggression is generally not a maladjusted reaction typical of the socially marginal; instead, aggression is intrinsic to status and escalates with increases in peer status until the pinnacle of the social hierarchy is attained. Over time, individuals at the very bottom and those at the very top of a hierarchy become the least aggressive youth. We also find that aggression is influenced not so much by individual gender differences as by relationships with the other gender and patterns of gender segregation at school. When cross-gender interactions are plentiful, aggression is diminished. Yet these factors are also jointly implicated in peer status: in schools where cross-gender interactions are rare, cross-gender friendships create status distinctions that magnify the consequences of network centrality.",

Subjects were presented with depictions of cross-gender activities in physical appearance, as well as with other types of social transgressions. Subjects were first administered a sorting task to assess their evaluations of the different types of transgression. Assessments were also made of subjects' judgments about the flexibility and relativity of the cross-gender activities and their personal commitment to gender boundaries. The results revealed a pattern of U-shaped behavioral growth in the! assessment of cross-gender transgressions, but not for the other social transgressions. Young children and adolescents regarded the crossing of stereotyped gender boundaries as more wrong, and expressed a greater personal commitment to sex-role regularity, than did children in middle childhood. The results showed, however, that although both young children and adolescents view gender differentiations as an aspect of psychological-personal identity, their conceptions of identity differ. In middle childhood, gender regularities are viewed as external and modifiable social expectations.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining upright is an unique feature of human beings and the basis for active and healthy life. Two of the greatest concerns for the elderly, functional dependence and falling, have been reported to be closely related to impaired balance performance. Thus, it is clear that balance performance plays a prominent role in the well beings of older adults. However, aging is typically accompanied by deteriorations in balance ability. Problems in maintaining various static standing postures, performing dynamic balance tasks, or responding to balance threats are common among the elderly. In order to lessen the problems and to avoid their further complications, it is imperative to advance balance performance in older population. There is a large body of research aiming at determining the effect of physical activities on balance performance in the elderly. No universal conclusion regarding the extent of the effect, effectiveness of specific physical training programs, or the potential for improvement in different populations has been made. In spite of the differences in research methodologies and findings, it is generally agreed upon that physical activities can affect age-related decline in balance performance. Thus, the profession of physical therapy should take a leading role in advocating the use of physical activities to improve balance performance in the elderly to promote active and healthy aging.",

      "abstract": "Sexual health is multidimensional across the lifespan. At midlife, women may face challenges to sexuality, often requiring intervention. Menopause-related and age-related hormonal changes intermingle with common medical conditions and contribute to biological substrates less favorable to a healthy sexual response. Psychological, sociocultural, and relational factors modulate the impact of such changes positively or negatively, contributing to adaptation or manifestation of sexually related distress. A comprehensive diagnostic approach and multidimensional management are needed to address sexual symptoms due to both menopause and aging, individualizing non-pharmacological and pharmacological evidence-based treatment options according to personal goals and expectations in the woman/couple.",

      "title": "Some applications of delinquency theory to childhood accidents.",
      "abstract": "The past two decades have witnessed an increasing recognition on the part of the physician and the behavioral scientist that the state of a person's health--indeed, even his likelihood of surviving infancy or of being institutionalized for mental illness-is closely related to his social status and to the social, political, economic, and cultural characteristics of his community, his state, and his nation. With the growth of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, such purely biological phenomena as infant mortality, mental illness, malnutrition, and venereal disease have come to concern the sociologist and the anthropologist as strongly as they have the physician and the epidemiologist. Accidental injury and death, however, have to a large extent remained outside the sphere of interdisciplinary scrutiny. One reason for this neglect stems from the fact that data on accidental injury are so much less reliable than other health data as to be virtually unusable. Perhaps another reason is that the concept of an accident as an act of God persists in the minds of otherwise sophisticated persons--and acts of God seem somehow unrelated to the social and cultural environment in which they occur. Regardless of the reasons, however, the fact remains that, although a good deal is known about the socioeconomic and cultural conditions that influence the infant mortality rate, mental illness, and cardiovascular accidents, very little is known about the relationship between social conditions and the incidence of accidental injury and death. The following paper does nothing to advance our knowledge of this relationship. But it points out the gaps in our present knowledge, warns against pitfalls that are more familiar to behavioral than to medical scientists, and pleads for the application of sound sociological theory to a problem which is as much social as it is medical.

      "abstract": "Depersonalization occurs in many psychiatric states but its origins are unknown. It is suggested that feelings of unreality may be unusually common in adolescents. Certain speculations are offered concerning the genesis of a sense of unreality. The neurophysiological mechanisms governing the perception of 'familiar' or 'strange' are seen to be the key to this experience. They involve the matching of events in the outer world against inner organizations of previous experience. These mechanisms are likely to be disturbed through epilepsy or other disorders of the temporal lobe, in which abnormal perceptions of strangeness and familiarity are frequently found. It is suggested that the matching process extends to include social situations, and that where an individual's identity is undeveloped or fragmented a sense of strangeness may result. The concept of identity is briefly discussed in order to distinguish it from 'self' and 'ego', and to intimate its possible fragmentation in adolescence. Finally, some reference is made to management and, in particular, to the use of the peer group.",

Hearing voices when others do not, acting out compulsive rituals, refusal to communicate, upredictable bursts of anger—these are examples of deviant behaviors that qualify persons as mentally ill in many cultural settings. Certain forms of deviance are designated as criminal in a given society. These are not usually viewed as indicative of mental illness unless they are accompanied by other behaviors, for example, compulsions, which are taken to be symptoms of mental illness. Still other forms of deviant behavior are seen as eccentric but not necessarily as mental illness. Eccentricities are behavioral peculiarities which often are not viewed as especially disruptive. The well-dressed man who wears an old piece of rope for a belt displays an eccentricity. So does the person who barks like a dog on the beach but desists from doing so in crowded urban places. Deviant behavior that is not defined as criminal in a given society but which others do find disruptive constitutes one basis for defining individuals as mentally ill.",

      "abstract": "Case studies show that traumatized refugees, who are survivors of serious human rights violations, suffer from persisting impunity in their home countries. Ongoing impunity--the inability to overcome the legal protection of the perpetrators assured by impunity laws, incomplete truthfinding, missing integral reparation and a lack of the necessary acknowledgement by society--represents an important obstacle for the recovery of survivors of serious human rights violations. There are reports describing that a high percentage of survivors shows an elevated mental vulnerability caused by impunity. Mental health problems resulting from traumatic experiences can persist or be reactivated by certain events. In particular, family members of the forcibly disappeared suffer from an incomplete mourning due to the uncertain fate of their beloved ones. The ongoing search for the forcibly disappeared under an atmosphere of impunity puts family members under high risk of retraumatization. Studies from other continents also prove that impunity severely affects mental health. Due to the global character of impunity there can be only little evidence about a positive impact of justice on mental health. Nevertheless, a few examples, in particular from Latin America, show that the combined implementation of memory, truth and justice can have a healing impact on those who suffer from trauma. They demonstrate that the fight against impunity is not only a legitimate moral struggle for human rights, but also a basic need for the sustainable recovery of survivors.",

They also experience worse emotional outcomes, including less happiness and enjoyment, and more stress, worry, and anger. In part, these negative outcomes come from selection into living with a child, especially selection on poor health, which is associated with worse outcomes irrespective of living conditions. Yet even with controls, the elderly who live with children do worse. This is in sharp contrast to younger adults who live with children, likely their own, whose life evaluation is no different in the presence of the child once background conditions are controlled for. Parents, like elders, have enhanced negative emotions in the presence of a child, but unlike elders, also have enhanced positive emotions. In parts of the world where fertility rates are higher, the elderly do not appear to have lower life evaluations when they live with children; such living arrangements are more usual, and the selection into them is less negative. They also share with younger adults the enhanced positive and negative emotions that come with children.

      "title": "Elders and Civil Law",
      "abstract": "Despite variations in definition, elders (also known as older adults) are frequently defined as individuals aged sixty years and older. Elders are characterised by having a higher risk for developing chronic illnesses, cognitive impairments, and related disabilities. In addition, they traditionally hold a disproportionate amount of wealth and assets compared to younger groups. As such, elders represent a unique cohort, and the reasons elders typically come in contact with civil courts differ greatly from those who are younger. In the United States, situations in which elders are involved in civil court most commonly include assessments of decision-making capacities and elder abuse. Capacity refers to an individual's ability to make a particular decision at a specific time or in a specific situation. Maintaining the ability to make independent decisions through older age is of prime and growing importance. Assessments of decisional capacity related to executing a will, managing finances, and independent decision-making are frequently encountered in this group. Although not typically thought of in the context of civil law, the capacity to consent to treatment and research, and the ability to maintain driving privileges are also particularly relevant to older adults. Another area of growing concern is elder abuse. Current estimates suggest elder abuse affects an estimated one in ten people aged sixty and older, and that for every reported case of elder abuse there are approximately twenty-three cases that have not been detected. A particularly significant area of elder abuse is financial exploitation. There are some indications that financial exploitation is the most common form of elder abuse, with older adults losing billions of dollars every year as a result of financial abuse and fraud. For these reasons and more, it is likely that older adults will experience increasing contact with civil law, primarily in the context of decisional capacity and elder abuse.",

      "abstract": "I once met a retired, twice divorced commissioning engineer who told me that ‘To be lonely is like losing your sight – I don't think that anybody who is not in that situation can understand it.’\r\n\r\nThere are many elderly people who find themselves in the same situation as the man I met, especially because more people are living longer as a result of improvements in science, technology and social care.\r\n\r\nThe trend towards an ever older population is universal. By 2011, life expectancy had already exceeded 75 years in 57 countries of the world,1 and by 2017 the population aged over 65 years worldwide will outnumber children under 5 years of age.2\r\n\r\nThe theme of World Mental Health Day 2013 is mental health in the elderly. This provides an opportunity to consider the particular challenge of loneliness and isolation in old age.\r\n\r\nSocial isolation and loneliness may be related, but are different. Social isolation typically refers to physical separation from other people, such as living alone or residing in a rural geographical area. Loneliness refers to a subjective emotional state of being alone, separated or apart from others.3 The experience of feeling lonely while in the midst of a social network can be described as alienation, and research shows that there is a relationship between social isolation, loneliness and health outcomes,4–7 and also quality of life.8\r\n\r\nThere is so much that can be done to prevent loneliness, and the focus of World Mental Health Day 2013 enables us to double our efforts. Practical interventions that are effective include befriending schemes, social group schemes, regular home visits, telephone contacts, problem solving and Community Navigators.9,10\r\n\r\nThe man whom I met, who likened feeling lonely to losing one's sight, might have benefited from simple community interventions such as volunteering or joining a social group. As a retired engineer he still had so much to give. Perhaps we, as a community, need to find ways to better recognise the problem of loneliness and social isolation, so that practical support can be given to enable individuals to maintain that sense of connection, social role and belonging.\r\n\r\nYou can make your contribution by becoming an advocate for the theme of World Mental Health Day 2013 (www.wfmh.com/00WorldMentalHealthDay.htm).",

      "title": "Mental Health of Elderly People",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAgeing is a privilege and a societal achievement. It is also a challenge, which will have an impact on all aspects of 21st Century society. is a complex process that involves physical, mental, spiritual and social processes that affect each person differently. The definition of adult varies, depending on different perspectives and purposes. There are chronological, biological, cultural and psychological definitions of age. In general, 60 years has been used as a yardstick for age. Researchers identify subgroups of adults as younger old (ages 65-75), older-old (ages 75-85), and old (ages 85+).The general perception is that the elderly, or senior citizens form a homogenous group but the fact is that there is a great deal of variation in this group. There are people who remain alert and active well into their 90's while others may show visible signs of aging, whether emotional or physical, as early as their 50's and 60's. So, healthy ageing can be defined as the process of optimizing opportunities for physical, social and mental health, to enable older people to take an active part in society without discrimination and to enjoy an independent and good quality of life.There are both positive and negative connotations of getting old. On the positive side especially in traditional Indian context, age associated with wisdom, respect and the potential for spiritual growth. It relives them from family responsibilities and gives them freedom of action. On the negative side it is associated with physical and mental decline, stereotyped as self pitying, unhappy, complaining and unproductive. They often suffer from depression caused by loneliness and alienation. These negative effects derived from a loss of authority, absence of a meaningful role in social life, marginality in social relationship, material insecurity, dependence, and attenuated intergenerational relationship (Bali, 1999).When older individual forms a larger share of total population we can say that population is ageing. Population ageing is the most significant result of the process known as demographic transition. The UN defines a country as 'ageing' where the proportion of people over 60 reaches 7% (Prakash, 1999). Elderly population in constitutes 7.4% of total population in 2001 (male-7.1%, female-7.8%) and is projected to rise to 12.4% of population by 2026 and about 65% of the aged had to depend on others for their day to day maintenance (Central Statistics Office, Government of India, 2011).According to the projection by U.N. Population Division, there will be two elderly persons for every child in the world by 2050. This implies that the aged 60 and above, which currently constitute less than 20% of the world population, will account for 32% of the population by 2050. The older population itself is aging. The oldest is the fastest (80+) growing segment of older population which currently make up 11% of the 60+ age group and is expected to grow to 19% by 2050.Population aging has become a global phenomenon. Countries all over the world are facing significant aging of its population. Developing countries are aging faster than developed countries. Report by UN revealed that at present about two third of older people are living in the developing world and is expected to be around 75% by 2025. And in the developed world, very (80+) is the fastest growing population group.Talking of an old-age crisis in a country where nearly two-thirds of the populations are below the age of 30 appears ludicrous, but it will take only 25 years to get doubled aged population. A report on Ageing in India (1999) revealed that India's aged population is currently second largest in the world. The absolute number of over 60 populations in will increase from 76 million in 2001 to 137 million by 2021. This segment of population faces multiple medical and psychological problems which will pose mounting pressure on various socio-economic fronts. …",

      "title": "Stigma and discrimination: Time for interventions",
      "abstract": "The Greek word Stigma means \"to carve, to mark as a sign of shame, punishment or disgrace\". It largely is associated with a physical deformity or disfigurement or an undesirable or dangerous characteristic that can provoke and perpetuate stigma. Discrimination on the other hand results in definitive actions like prejudice, isolation/rejection, and stereotyping. Stigma and discrimination have existed all throughout history in relation to both physical and mental disorders. Leprosy, Epilepsy, HIV-AIDS, Venereal diseases, even Tuberculosis and almost all mental disorders have been highly stigmatized. Research attention on stigma and discrimination came to the fore in the last few decades. Most research in this area has been based on attitude surveys, describing the kinds of stigma and discrimination, and media representations of mental illness and violence, and has largely focused on schizophrenia. Almost all programs have excluded direct participation by service users, and there have not been many intervention studies in low and middle-income countries.[1] However, there is evidence that interventions to improve public knowledge about mental illness can be effective. The main challenge in the future is to identify which interventions will produce behavior change to reduce discrimination against people with mental illness. There have been Indian studies on the subject of stigma exploring negative attitudes, labels used to describe persons with mental illness,[2] stigma perceived by various groups of persons such as high school teachers[3], and portrayal of mental illness in newspapers[4] and films.[5] Stigma in rural populations has been dealt with in great detail by papers from the COPSI study.[6] This was a mixed method study on 282 persons living with schizophrenia and 282 caregivers in three Indian sites. Quantitative findings indicated that experiences of negative discrimination were reported less commonly (42%) than more internalized forms of stigma experience such as a sense of alienation (79%) and significantly less often than in studies carried out elsewhere. Higher levels of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, lower levels of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, higher caregiver knowledge about symptomatology, lower PLS age and not having a source of drinking water in the home were predictors of greater discrimination. The authors concluded that these findings add to the rationale for enhancing psycho-social interventions to support those facing discrimination and also highlight the importance of addressing public stigma and achieving higher level social and political structural change. With this fairly extensive knowledge base we have on what causes and perpetuates stigma and discrimination related to mental disorders, we need to move on to developing models of intervention targeted at various sections of the community. A review of intervention models[7] showed that the benefits of intervention have been largely short-term, be they for attitude change or enhancement of knowledge. The authors opine that there is a clear need for studies with longer-term follow-up to assess whether initial gains are sustained or attenuated and whether booster doses of the intervention are needed to maintain progress. A systematic review of the effectiveness of stigma reduction intervention studies in India[8] found only nine eligible studies. While most stigma-reduction interventions were multi-level, none focused on the organization/institutional level. Most interventions were delivered to community members. None focused on mental health professionals as intervention delivery targets. Maulik et al.[9] describe a longitudinal assessment of a multi-media stigma intervention program in the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Following that, the primary care-based mental health service was delivered for one year. Most knowledge, attitude, and behavior scores improved over the three-time points. Overall mean scores on stigma perceptions related to help-seeking improved a little. It is fair to conclude that while we are largely aware of the nature of the stigma of mental disorders and its perpetuating factors in the Indian socio-cultural scene, there needs to be a thrust on evolving, implementing, and evaluating more anti-stigma interventions in communities. It is in this context that the recently released report of the Lancet Commission on Stigma and Discrimination[10] assumes a lot of importance. This Lancet Commission report is the result of a collaboration of more than 50 people worldwide and brings together evidence and experience of the impact of stigma and discrimination and successful interventions for stigma reduction. More significantly, there have been a lot of inputs and active collaboration of people with lived experience of mental health conditions (PWLE), in keeping with the view of nothing about us without us. The report has also shown that there is enough accrued evidence that PWLE is the key change agents for stigma reduction. The four main components considered were: self-stigma (or internalized stigma), which occurs when people with mental health conditions are aware of the negative stereotypes of others, agree with them, and turn them against themselves; stigma by association, which refers to the attribution of negative stereotypes and discrimination directed against family members (eg, parents, spouses, or siblings) or to mental health staff; public and interpersonal stigma, which refer to the forms of knowledge and stereotypes, negative attitudes (prejudice), and negative behavior (discrimination) by members of society towards people with mental health conditions; and structural (systemic or institutional) stigma, which refers to policies and programs which work against persons with mental disorders. Many negative aspects of stigma such as damage to marital prospects, social exclusion in relation to education, the workplace, and the community, loss of property, inheritance, or rights to vote, and poorer health care have all been dealt with in this report. Contravention of basic human rights has an impact on four domains: personal, including self-stigma, quality of life, and service use; structural, including legal provisions, human rights, and the implementation of psychosocial interventions; health and social care; and social and economic, including work. The group reviewed 216 papers on effective interventions and found that the most effective, evidence-based way of reducing stigma was probably increasing all forms of social contact. Other features of successful programs were involving PWLE in all aspects of co-producing ant stigma programs; carefully creating and adapting the program content based on context and culture; consulting closely with the identified target groups; and paying attention to the effects, outcomes, and sustainability of the program. The role of traditional and new media in perpetuation/reducing stigma was also explored in detail. The results of a global survey of 300 PWLE respondents in 45 countries (mostly LAMIC) reinforced the role of media and pointed out that treatment meted out to them should be on par with those with physical health conditions. The Commission proposed eight key recommendations for action by international organizations, governments (to implement policies to support ending of stigma and discrimination), employers, (to provide employment opportunities) the health-care and social-care sectors, the media (stop the use of stigmatizing terms to refer to persons with mental disorders and project more positive stories) PWLE, local communities, and civil society, each with a specific target and indicators to develop a framework for ending mental health-related stigma and discrimination. Recommendations have also been made for policies to support the end of stigma and discrimination at national and global levels and the provision of equitable health care. As far as India is concerned, I would urge the initiation of many more multi-modal anti-stigma campaigns co-designed with PWLEs and their rigorous monitoring. In fact, the Government of India and of the states should take the lead in this activity as was done with other stigmatizing conditions such as Leprosy and HIV.

This is because of the immaturity and relative incompetence of minors, compared to adults. However, in the context of the justice system, parents, in particular, may not be the best defenders of juvenile rights. This article draws on social science research to argue that, due to conflicts of interest, lack of knowledge, and poor relationships with their delinquent children, parents of juvenile delinquents are poor protectors of their children’s rights in the context of police interviews and interrogations. Other protections should instead be provided, such as requiring age to weigh heavily in favor of the juvenile when determining whether an interview is a custodial interrogation, and requiring the presence of an attorney at interrogations of juveniles.",

The goals of this article are to educate health care professionals on specific health care issues faced by this community.\r\n\r\nOnly a limited amount of information is available on health care risks within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender population. Most studies do not address sexual orientation. Fear of stigmatization prevents many people from identifying themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. In addition, many do not seek health care (and are therefore excluded from health studies) because of prior negative experience. As many as two thirds of physicians never ask patients about their sexual orientation.3 Some health care professionals assume that their patients are heterosexual. Others may be homophobic and hostile and prefer to avoid the issue.",

Most probably work-shyness occurs in almost every community, but its extent is usually not such that it can be regarded as a social problem. The extent of work-shyness amongst the Coloureds is, however, such that it does constitute a social problem. A work-shy person can be defined as someone who is able to work and ought to work, but does not want to because he holds a different value-orientation towards work. Work-shyness is a manifestation of a disposition, an inner condition, a deep-rooted attitude and way of living, which is fundamentally interwoven with the entire personality and existence of the individual. This negative attitude towards work (work-shyness) amongst the Coloureds can be mainly explained in terms of: (1) faulty or inadequate socialization, and (2) the marginal position of the Coloureds; whereas (3) differential association, and (4) structural conduciveness as possible ways of explanation are not excluded.",

First-borns scored significantly higher in self-esteem than last-borns; only and middle-borns did not score differently from any nf the other groups. Only children exhibited a stronger internal locus of control and scored higher on the self-centeredness item than other groups. No relationship was found between sibling status and loneliness. In terms of achievement, firstand middle-borns scored more competitively than last-borns. Only and first-borns had higher aspirations than later-horns. No sibling status effects were found in the areas of mastery, willingness to work, or personal concern about the costs of achievement. Results suggest that the impact of gender and family size on these sibling status effects are areas in need of further assessment.

The current article explores the stigma of excellence by analyzing open-ended surveys from 169 gifted adolescents age 11–18 years. Findings suggest difference, rather than deficit, contributes to stigma's construction. Gifted adolescents experienced a dialectic of (perceived) superiority and inferiority: They are both stigmatized because peers perceive them as intellectual superiors, and their superiority is discursively reconstituted as inferiority. Additionally, perceived superiority poses relational threats. Peers become jealous or remain uncertain how to interact with individuals profoundly deviating from normalcy. Thus, they reject the gifted as a protective measure. Finally, gifted adolescents might experience several positive outcomes from their stigmatization.

We examine four dimensions of health at mid-life: chronic conditions, mobility limitations, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms. We find that the experience of marital disruption damages health, with the effects still evident years later; among the currently married, those who have ever been divorced show worse health on all dimensions. Both the divorced and widowed who do not remarry show worse health than the currently married on all dimensions. Dimensions of health that seem to develop slowly, such as chronic conditions and mobility limitations, show strong effects of past marital disruption, whereas others, such as depressive symptoms, seem more sensitive to current marital status. Those who spent more years divorced or widowed show more chronic conditions and mobility limitations.",

      "title": "SEXTING, NON-CONSENSUAL IMAGE SHARING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH",
      "abstract": "Background and Aims: Sexting refers to the exchange (sending and/or receiving) of self-taken sexual photographs, usually depicting the sender nude or semi-nude, via mobile phone. Academic and media narratives tend to portray sexting as a deviant behaviour due to the perceived risks of non-consensual image distribution (where individuals’ sexual images are shared without permission): Qualitative research suggests the psychological harms of revenge pornography (one type of non-consensual image distribution) are comparable to the effects of sexual assault and are gendered in nature; considered part of a continuum of sexual violence against women. There is a lack of quantitative research regarding adult sexting and non-consensual image sharing. Studies to date have conflated consensual and non-consensual sexting behaviours and have poor methodological design in terms of the operational definitions used. Researchers investigating sexters’ psychological health have thus far neglected to consider individual factors (e.g. coping, resilience and sexting attitudes), interpersonal aspects (e.g. relationship context and privacy expectations) and image characteristics. Existing research is biased by the measures used (i.e. primary focus on psychological distress) and there has been limited opportunity to demonstrate positive sexting associations (e.g. relational wellbeing). We therefore sought to develop a more nuanced understanding of sexters’ psychological health and wellbeing by addressing the following questions:\r\nHow common are non-consensual image sharing experiences amongst a UK community (non-clinical) sample of adult sexters?\r\nAre there any differences in the psychological health and wellbeing of non-sexters and sexters (including those who have experienced non-consensual image sharing)?\r\nAre any sexting specific factors, such as privacy expectations, image characteristics and relationship with recipients, associated with psychological health?\r\nAre there any differences in psychological health and wellbeing between consensual sexters’, those who have experienced non-consensual sexting, and non-sexters’ when coping, resilience and sexting specific factors are accounted for?\r\nMethod: We utilised a quantitative, cross-sectional online survey design. Participants from a non-clinical adult population (N = 270) were recruited via social media. The\r\nsurvey consisted of a sexting questionnaire identifying type of sexting behaviours, relationship context, privacy beliefs and sexting attitudes; as well as non-consensual image sharing behaviours and experiences. Psychological measures used included: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress scales (DASS-21), the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing scale (WEMWBS), the Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), the Brief COPE and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS).\r\nResults: 87% of the sample had engaged in sexting as an adult, primarily within committed relationships in order to maintain sexual intimacy. 14% of sexters had experienced the non-consensual distribution of their images and 16% had distributed others’ images without permission. Males and females did not differ significantly in who experienced non-consensual image distribution. Images were most often shared by someone the person was dating, typically with friends and family, although images were shared online in 43% of cases. Privacy expectations and sexting attitudes were not related to psychological health or wellbeing. When coping and resilience were accounted for, experiencing non-consensual image distribution was not related to psychological distress but individuals who were uncertain if their images had been shared had lower wellbeing, and consensual sexters who sent sexts to multiple partners had higher anxiety.\r\nConclusion: Our research suggests that the problematic coping strategies individuals employ, and their level of resilience have a stronger relationship with psychological health than do their sexting behaviours; although further quantitative research with clear consistent definitions of sexting and non-consensual image sharing is needed to identify if these findings are replicable. Clinical interventions for those who are distressed by non-consensual image distribution should focus on identifying and reducing the use of problematic coping strategies such as avoidance, denial and self-blame. Sexting may be considered a normative part of intimate relationships: Educational strategies should fully explore issues of consent and perceived gender stereotypes; as opposed to encouraging individuals to abstain from sexting as a deviant or risky behaviour (which could contribute to self-blame and victim blaming). Future research should focus on understanding specific motivations for and types of non-consensual image distribution (e.g. revenge pornography) and whether it is associated with more harmful aspects of relationships such as interpersonal violence.",

The notion of social divisions is broad and correlates with other concepts in social theory, including hierarchies, equality/inequality, culture, poverty, and identity. The central, controversial issues pertain to commonalities, which are shared across a group of people within a culture or a society, and diversities within a group, culture or society. Inequalities in health exist regardless of the way in which socio-economic class is measured and at all stages of the life span. People of the lowest socio-economic status are at far higher risk, not only of physical illness and early death, but also of accidents, premature births, mental illness and suicide. The documented views of black disabled people consistently speak to experiences of segregation and marginalisation within services.",

      "abstract": "A very powerful form of preoedipal guilt stems from a sense of having damaged the life-giving parent with one's most basic needs. A related phenomenon is the child's sense that another subjectivity has deliberately chosen to give and sustain the child's life. This experience gives rise to a compelling mixture of awe, reverence, and obligation, a sense of guilt about being born, of debt concerning the gift of life . This sense of guilt and debt are part of every child's development. Depending on how conflicts surrounding them are negotiated, the child can come to feel either an appetite for living or a crushing sense of selfishness and unworthiness. Such forms of guilt and debt may lead not only to masochism generally, but to a particularly pernicious form of negative therapeutic reaction that can sabotage psychoanalytic work. A patient may feel, for instance, that a successful psychoanalysis is a selfish indulgence and an immoral betrayal of a sacred duty to rescue his or her parents from their misery. Guilt about being born and the sense of debt concerning the gift of life are linked to various developmental, psychodynamic, interpersonal, and cultural phenomena.",

Conforming as a man in prison may involve performing or projecting prison masculinities to ensure emotional, psychological, and social survival, employing strategies to mask self-perceived weaknesses or vulnerability and to attain status and legitimacy. While few men are likely to subscribe to archetypal masculine roles or stereotypes, ethnographic research with adult male prisoners revealed that individuals endeavored to fit in and become socially accepted into the prison community, commonly aligning themselves with normative values, attitudes, and behaviors of prison life, and striving for social legitimacy. “Front management” strategies were employed by individuals to convey “masculine” personas consistent with the prison code, a system of values based on aggression, violence, control, and exploitation—or “dog eat dog” and “divide and rule”—where individuals would become situated within the hegemonic social hierarchy. Participants equated emotional, psychological, and social survival with health and well-being, which was in turn dependent in part on their social status and legitimacy. Paradoxically, this disempowering and divisive hegemony could lay vulnerable individuals open to exploitation and harm, while also undermining prisoners' personal efforts to improve themselves, physically, emotionally, intellectually, and vocationally. Prisoners' efforts to fit into an excessively performance-orientated masculine culture are therefore likely to work against criminal justice goals to reintegrate offenders back into society.",

Generally, they are peaceful, obsessive, often hypothymic; they express disgust for the body, suffer various somatic dysfunctions due to the sexual stasis; they have difficulties in communicating with things and beings.

During the middle ages, the central issue was whether self-starvation was the work of God or the devil. Subsequently the question was whether the explanation was scientific or religious. The aim of medical science was to find a scientific explanation or debunk the phenomenon as fraudulent. The causes of self-starvation remain unclear. During the nineteenth century, the focus switched back and forth between biological and psychosocial models. Current multifactorial aetiological models take into account biological susceptibility, socio-cultural factors and psychological vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "Sex is one of the three primary human instincts, with self-preservation and social instinct, and is thus well developed in the typical individual. Sexual Dysfunction is referred to as problems that a person or partner encounters during any phase of typical sexual activity - physical pleasure, desire, preference, arousal, or orgasm. A person’s inability to participate in a sexual relationship as they would wish is how the World Health Organization describes sexual dysfunction. It can affect both men and women and may be caused by physical, or psychological factors. Sexual dysfunction, if not addressed promptly, can significantly impacts fertility. Since sexual dysfunction usually coincides with anatomical as well as psychological factors, a comprehensive sexual history, evaluation of general health, and reproductive health, and identification of any additional sexual problems (if any) are critical while diagnosing sexual dysfunction. The concept of sexual dysfunction is not new to Ayurveda. Classics include various references to it in the context of Yoni Vyapads, Dosha Vriddhi, Kshaya, Ojus, Artava Vaha Sroto Viddha Lakshana, and Manovikaras, along with probable causative factors and solutions. Ayurveda addresses the anatomical, psychological, and endocrinological aspects of sexual dysfunctions. Following Dinacharya, Rajaswala Paricharya, Garbhini Paricharya, and Sutika Paricharya provide extensive treatment regimens by focusing on the overall health of an individual’s reproductive, psychological, and endocrinological well-being. Female sexual dysfunction is a multifactorial condition that requires a holistic approach. Modern medical treatments offer targeted solutions, while Ayurvedic therapies promote balance and long-term vitality.",

      "abstract": "The social practice of forming and maintaining personal identities makes human interaction, and therefore society, possible. Our identities give us our sense of how we are supposed to act and how we may or must treat others, so how we hold each other in our identities is of crucial moral importance. To hold someone in her identity is to treat her according to the stories one uses to make sense of who she is. If the identity is to represent accurately the person who bears it, the tissue of stories that constitute it must continue to change as the person grows and changes. Here, good holding is a matter of retaining the stories that still depict the person but letting go of the ones that no longer do. The book traces this work of holding and letting go over the human lifespan, paying special attention to its implications for bioethics. A pregnant woman starts to call her fetus into personhood. Children develop their moral agency as they learn to hold themselves and others in their identities. Ordinary adults hold and let go, sometimes well and sometimes badly. People bearing damaged or liminal identities leave others uncertain how to hold and what to let go. Identities are called into question at the end of life and persist after the person has died. In all, the book offers a glimpse into a fascinating moral terrain that is ripe for philosophical exploration.",

Rather, some other data suggest that not few of them are convinced that themselves are the exceptions of rare isolated case. A conclusive factor of giving up driving may be out of their own judgement in an overwhelming majority; and yet it seems that the consciousness of declined eyesight could be a finishing blow whether they admit it or not. Although the advice of a doctor or a family member, or the result of a driving aptitude test may be considered a good means of becoming aware of one's limit of ability, it is more recommendable to resort to a counseling method such as let him experience the awakening of his present self approach, before attempting to persuade them straightforwardly or enumerating fragments of plausible explanation. Furthermore, some consider leaving everything until one will encounter an accident or become frightened/startled would be an effective approach. However, the thought itself is dangerous because a slight misstep will have a serious effect, this is matter of life and death. From now on, it is necessary to promote spread of driving aptitude tests. At the same time, a reasonable amount of consideration and thoughtfulness will be required on the part of examiners with regard to the manner and attitudes when conducting tests, as well as the method itself.

Prevalence of conduct problems was 65.2%. Tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine were used before the first robbery and/or theft, first drug dealing, and first arrest.The fact that drug use onset preceded illegal acts suggests that the latter are the consequence of the consumption of the former, or perhaps, the consequence of \"social invisibility\" (feeling of not belonging to anything or to anybody) by which these youths undergo.Labeling these youths as conduct-disordered adolescents may cloud a rather different reality, and it may submit them to more social isolation and stigmatization as well.",

      "abstract": "Although 'full citizenship' of mentally handicapped persons is strongly advocated in views on care and in policy plans, its practical application is not at all a matter of course. Looking at the course of history, it can be concluded that a long period of comparative indifference was followed by a quick succession of various views on mental deficiency and the mentally handicapped. The mentally handicapped person as an incurable patient developed into a person with possibilities, a full citizen who participates in society, has rights and duties and is certainly not the least among his equals. But ideals are confronted with the reality. The propagated equality is immediately denied through patronising, protective measures and special facilities and privileges that have been assigned. It is not easy to find a balance in this and it can be concluded that reflections and proceedings with regard to the mentally handicapped are characterised by continual doubts. The hypothesis of this study is that not only the scientific domains have been overcome by ambivalent doubts; everyday practice of care for the mentally handicapped is also characterised by moral ambivalence. This ambivalence leads to diffidence with regard to proceedings, to being unsure of the legitimacy of the proceedings, which in turn influences the quality of care in a negative way. This study discusses possibilities of dealing with this moral ambivalence.Through researching and describing the moral demands of public ideas of man and from their personal interpretations in everyday practice, an insight will be given into the extent of interaction between the two. Suggestions are made to create facilities for the development of the moral competence of the employees",

The second type arises from a socially determined inability of certain groups of the population to become parents. Furthermore, the birth of a child (whether to a couple or to a single parent) creates the vertical family, which is the real basis and structure of any stable society. Given that infertility has been regarded for centuries as a divine punishment, childless people have traditionally been viewed as defi cient. Infertility inevitably leads to moral suffering and a lower social status. The inability to have children is one of the main causes of divorce. The most effi cient method to overcome both biological and social infertility is surrogacy, sometimes implemented in addition to gameteor embryo-donation programs.",

      "title": "SEPARATION ANXIETY AND DE FACTO DENIAL OF VISITATION",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The dynamics of separation anxiety and its potential impact upon restriction of legal visitation in preschool age children is discussed. The interplay between adult personality characteristics and the child's developmental level is inextricably intertwined to generate separation fears. This interplay is presented within a theoretical framework of interaction. Unfortunately, the child's reactions to separation are frequently misinterpreted by the parents as indications of some mistreatment by the former spouse. Although adjustment difficulties in preschool age children coping with divorce are likely, the pattern of disturbance associated with separation anxiety is predictable and occurs almost exclusively with temporary removal from the primary parent. Behavioral health and legal professionals are cautioned against allowing such behavioral disturbance to be utilized by combative parents to deny, restrict or abridge scheduled visitations with the nonresidential parent. Requests for private custody evaluations have increased dramatically in the past decade. Behavioral health professionals often find themselves being jointly stipulated to by disagreeing parties, or directly appointed by the court, to help formulate a residential plan to meet “the best interests of the children” affected. When assessing divorcing families with young children, varied adjustment patterns are observed. However, as Wallerstein and Kelly (1980) discovered, almost all children are adversely affected by the family rupture, at least on a short‐term basis. Surprisingly less than 10 percent of the children experienced relief following the parental decision to divorce, despite the degree of explosiveness which may have characterized the dysfunctional marital relationship. Further, the particular response style exhibited by the children was primarily dependent upon the developmental and emotional level the child attained prior to the time of divorce. While positive adjustment has been correlated with an absence of feuding or animosity between the divorcing parents (McKinnon &amp; Wallerstein, 1986), preschool children seem quite vulnerable to adjustment difficulties. Evidence has also begun to accumulate to suggest that divorce has a more serious impact upon boys than girls (Hetherington, 1979). Problems frequently surface during times of exchange, particularly when parents are actively engaged in battle. At its worst, these extreme maladjustments may resemble what appears to be a separation anxiety. Again, the Wallerstein and Kelly (1980) studies reported that preschool age youngsters displayed fright, exhibited regressions, confusion, increased aggression, maintained disruptive fantasies, and experienced guilt. While most of these symptoms remit within a year to a year and a half following divorce, continued bickering and conflict between the parents either prevents resolution, or may even exacerbate, these symptoms later. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the phenomenon of separation anxiety in greater detail, and to provide professionals aiding divorcing families with preschool age children sufficient information to recognize and understand these problems. Hopefully, this knowledge will facilitate those entrusted with making custodial‐visitation recommendations, the confidence to follow through with agreed visitation plans despite what at first may appear to be discomfort to the child.",

      "abstract": "Vision is often an essential capacity for the interaction between individuals and their environment. Yet, for some individuals, an impaired visual system alters that opportunity. Visual loss can be lifelong, present from birth; for others, it can be progressive or abrupt. For some individuals, particularly those who lose vision later in life, the loss of vision is associated with a corresponding loss of independence, and impact on their emotional status. A lifespan perspective regarding visual impairment (VI) holds that the experience of VI since birth or early childhood is qualitatively different from the experience of individuals who acquire VI later in life. For example, in early childhood, VI impacts psychomotor and cognitive development that relies upon visual information processing and places challenges on the educational system, which must provide appropriate supports. In contrast, when acquired later in life, VI may place challenges on the ability to complete tasks of daily living, be independent, and engage in leisure activities, but not affect learning status or how knowledge is shared.",

Incontinence, regular enemas, genital reconstruction, catheterization and scares are just some of the common difficulties affected people have to live with. Intimate disabilities like anorectal malformations cause feelings of shame and embarrassment, and are taboo in our society. Experiences of rejection or just the fear of it cause affected people to hide their disability. In a qualitative study, affected young adults talked about the impact of this disability on their lifes. All interviewees started to hide their condition sometime in older childhood and early adolescents. After a struggling process, torn between fears of discovery and rejection all of them found ways to communicate their condition. All interviewees described revealing their condition in stages and only to certain social groups. Trust is the main prerequisite for revelation. Trust has two aspects, first the person needs to trust that the information will not be spread and second there needs to be trust that the other person will be able to understand and accept the person despite their condition. Support through family, friends, and peers in a support group are helpful. Important in this process is once ability to accept their own condition.",

      "abstract": "Articles on \"Identity and Emerging Adulthood\" can include any identity-related topic that pertains to people in the 18-29 age period. I prefer the term emerging adulthood to \"youth,\" \"young adulthood,\" or \"the transition to adulthood\" because emerging adulthood is a term that has been more clearly defined in its developmental meaning. Emerging adulthood has been conceptualized as a period marked by exploration and instability, and these characteristics certainly pertain to identity issues. The explorations of emerging adulthood are often identity-related, in that they tend to concern love, work, or ideology. The instability of emerging adulthood is a reflection of the changes young people make in the course of their identity explorations. Although identity has traditionally been regarded as a topic that especially pertains to adolescence, today in industrialized societies identity explorations tend to continue into emerging adulthood and in fact become more systematic and serious than in adolescence. Articles submitted to Identity that concern the emerging adulthood period should have a developmental context, not necessarily in line with previous ideas about emerging adulthood but reflecting a consideration of how the developmental characteristics of emerging adulthood may be similar to or different from adolescence or (later) adulthood.

      "title": "Loss of the 'Supplementary Spouse' in Marriages in Later Life",
      "abstract": "An important but often unrecognized relationship must be taken into account. When problems arise in a of many years (marriage here refers to all long-term relationships of committed life partners), one cannot help but ask, Why now? What has happened to challenge and stress the marital bond? What challenge with which they cannot cope is the couple facing now? Is the challenge itself so daunting, or rather, are the resources available to address it inadequate? After all, the couple has a long history of individual and dyadic coping that has been strengthened and refined over the years, and has been applied to numerous challenges. So why now? As a clinician, I often train a diagnostic lens on the individual, appraising what change might have served as precipitant to the current distress. The same questions can be posed when looking at a couple. Is there a new personal challenge for one of the partners? A change in medical condition or medication? Or did something happen to the couple to engender the distress? Has the couple been unsettled by a move, perhaps? Or retirement from work? These frequently occurring events in older age can contribute to structural changes within a marriage, often of sufficient power to cause distress in one or both spouses. The clinical literature addressing these events is extensive. The theme of loss and its impact on the is of continuing importance in later life-most significant, of course, with the eventual death of a There are, however, other losses, often connected to transitional events, that are powerful yet less well identified as contributors to significant structural change in the in later life. These are para-spousal losses, that is, losses of a significant person who plays a very important role in the life of one of the partners in the couple, but is not the spouse-thus the idea of the spouse. While many, perhaps most, marriages in later life are most fittingly thought of as dyada, some are more appropriately described as triads. An apt metaphor could be that of a tripod, a frame with three legs supporting something, in this case a marriage, wherein sturdiness and stability rely on functional intactness of all three legs. In these marriages, the supplementary spouse is the third leg of the tripod. While the specific relationships are different, all supplementary spouses serve a common function of supporting the marriage. When this critical support is lost, the effect is to bring stress upon the marriage. Consider the supplementary spouse as a supporting beam in a building structure. If this beam becomes damaged or collapses, the consequence can be that the entire structure becomes damaged or collapses. Sometimes the loss of a supplementary spouse is behind the presenting problems that come to clinical attention. The major functions of in older age (truly, at any age) are collaboration, companionship, support, intimacy, and self-continuity; the supplementary spouse serves to fulfill these functions well. The supplementary spouse, thus, is an integral segment of the marital triad. Included in this collection of relationships, among others, are the long-term lover, the intimate friend and confidante, the companion, the work wife,'' and the recreational buddy? In the case of the long-term lover, an affair often develops over the years into a marriage with defined rules, roles, and responsibilities and the lover now aparallel. What begins as a relationship outside the primary evolves, over the long term, into a parallel defined as a committed life-partner relationship. Over time, the edges of the two marriages-once having been parallel, maintaining a constant distance apart and thus never meeting-often become increasingly comparable and, not unusually, meet and cross. …",

      "title": "MEASURING INTERGENERATIONAL AMBIVALENCE TOWARD OLDER ADULTS IN THE FAMILY CONTEXT: A SCOPING REVIEW",
      "abstract": "Abstract Informal family caregivers may frequently feel ambivalent toward taking care of older family members. Ambivalence is the simultaneously held conflicting emotions, cognitions and/or behavioral tendencies due to countervailing expectations about how individual should act within the cultural norms. Most existing measurements directly or indirectly measuring caregiving or intergenerational ambivalence were developed from the West. Less is known how ambivalence is understood across distinctive sociocultural context globally. This scoping review examines the dimensions of existing instruments in measuring caregiver ambivalence toward older adults. Peer-reviewed articles were identified in five electronic databases. A keyword search was performed associated with ambivalence, caregiver or family, and measure development. Ten instruments were included. These instruments used different terms to represent caregiver ambivalence, not limited to intergenerational ambivalence and filial maturity. Existing measure items primarily capture the simultaneously held conflicting emotions toward older family members but limited to the domains of behaviors or cognitions. Moreover, existing measures are not inclusive of family caregiving to capture ethnic minorities who provide support to older family members motivated by filial responsibility beliefs. The scoping review uncovers the gaps between conceptual understanding and measurement of caregiver ambivalence toward older adults in the family. Findings will inform the direction of future research and the development of a culturally relevant measure that captures the intergenerational ambivalence experienced by ethnic minority who provide family support to older adults. The review will likely inform practice policy, and research in caregiving in a culturally sensitive manner.",

      "abstract": "The view that behavioural development is continuous, with the child's state at each point in time influencing future behaviour, has recently been challenged. However, the evidence for radical discontinuities between underlying organisations at different stages varies greatly in character and is often equivocal. Apparent discontinuities may appear for trivial reasons. Furthermore, an unequivocal sudden change in behaviour in the course of development may arise from continuous change at an underlying level of organisation. There need be no straightforward relationship between behaviour and the underlying 'psychological structure'. In addition, the complex interaction between sources of variation, and the existence of negative and positive feedback mechanisms in development, make the effects of a given experience difficult to predict. For these different reasons it is argued that a polarisation of views about whether development is continuous or discontinuous is distracting and liable to impede understanding of developmental processes.",

It develops into interests, which in turn develop into personal, social, occupational, and research choices. Being curious and exploratory entails risk; one must be willing to step out of one’s comfort zone to seek new information and experiences. There are individual differences in both the cognitive and sensory forms of curiosity, with cognitive curiosity being closely linked to knowledge-seeking and problem-solving, and sensory curiosity closely associated with creativity and innovation. Research suggests there are age, gender, and to a much lesser extent, ethnic differences in curiosity. Contrary to popular belief, curiosity does not mysteriously disappear as we age; instead, we channel our curiosities into interpersonal, occupational, and intellectual areas. In other words, unless we are physically or psychologically unwell, our curiosity remains as robust as it ever was.",

      "abstract": "Gay, lesbian, and bisexual (sexual minority) individuals are at greater risk of experiencing risk factors for negative health and psychological outcomes in adolescence than their straight counterparts. This is largely due to the stigma and social consequences of outwardly identifying as a sexual minority. However, some sexual minority individuals experience protective factors that bolster social support during adolescence, which may act as a buffer against the effects of stigma leading to more positive health and psychological outcomes in adulthood. Both adolescent risk factors and protective factors in sexual minority individuals may contribute to professional success and achievement in adult life vis-a-vis their resultant psychological and health outcomes. As sexual minority individuals in adolescence tend to experience risk and protective factors differently from their straight counterparts, the same may also be true for individuals attending graduate school. Certain protective factors in adolescence may be commonly experienced for individuals who end up attending graduate school. Very little empirical research has been conducted to examine the differential experiences during adolescence with regard to protective factors and sexual minority identification in graduate students. This paper focuses on the impact that protective factors during adolescence may contribute to graduate school as an outcome for sexual minority individuals. Specifically, family support, social support, ego identity, personal psychological resources, and acceptance are considered. Areas of future research are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The term \"mugging\" has come to be accepted as synonymous with the type of damage which is inflicted by thugs on members of the community. In fact it is the act of attacking from behind or seizing an individual by the throat. To \"assault\" is to attack violently but this need not be entirely physical and may indeed be at least in part verbal, as for example in an argument.Regrettably the incidence of both is increasing year by year, and not infrequently may endanger life. The circumstances relating to muggings and assault are many, but fall essentially into two groups — the provoked attack and that which is unprovoked. There tend to be three distinct patterns of attack — \"man-to-man\" contact, that which falls into the category of \"gang warfare\" in which several individuals attack another group, while gang assaults on individuals are also constantly in the common press. Young people require avenues of expression and if this is improperly provided for, or inadequately controlled, it can lead to violence. Every citizen has a responsibility to the community in which he or she lives and there can be no doubt that they can often discourage such aspects of life as juvenile delinquency and violence by providing facilities and amenities designed to combat such socially unacceptable behavioural patterns. Indiscreet use of the tongue, facial muscles of expression, and digital signs may individually or collectively predispose to evoking physical response from others. Understanding of these precipitating factors and conscious effort to avoid them by whatever means are available will obviously reduce the number of cases of assault. Only a small proportion of such cases reach either the courts or the hospitals and it can be assumed that those which do are of the more serious type.",

Traditionally older problem drinkers have been divided into two categories: Type I, individuals who have drunk excessively throughout life yet survived to old age and Type II, individuals whose problem drinking began late in life. An extensive renew of the research produced some paths to late-onset problem drinking but only a weak profile of the Type II alocholic. Popular situational factors purported to be the triggers for late-onsest abuse have mixed support and no clear causal theory has yet been delineated. A number of alternative theories deserve further attention. Current information does not support the usefulness of the Type II classification or traditional definitions of alcoholism for the late-onset abuser. Research and treatment efforts may need to be redirected to include male-female differences, and family conflicts with less emphasis on the disease model of alcoholism.",

Other, more dramatic, or disastrous, defects have received more publicity than hearing problems. Yet, depending on the age of onset, the hearing defect may alter every aspect of a person's life. Although some types of hearing loss are reversible, many hearing disabilities tend to remain static or reflect a progressively worsening quality. Social, economic,",

Conflict occurs because the performance of one role interferes with the performance of another. Role conflict can be time‐based, strain‐based, or behavior‐based. Antecedents of work–family conflict can be within the same work or family domain or across domains. Role overload exists when an individual fulfills multiple roles simultaneously and lacks the resources to perform them. It can evolve from both excessive time demands and excessive psychological demands. Role strain is an outcome of role conflict and overload. Solutions to reducing the effects of role conflict, overload, and strain include reducing demands, increasing resources, or both. More specifically, role‐sequencing, role‐prioritizing, and role change, as well as increasing social resources and managing boundaries between work and family responsibilities, are options for reducing role conflict, overload, and strain.",

The first argument draws on the widely accepted view that paternalism is easier to justify the more good it promotes for the paternalizee. It argues that paternalism targeting young people generally promotes more good for the people interfered with than similar paternalism targeting older people. While promoting people's interests or well-being is essential to the justification of paternalism, the first argument has certain unfair implications in that it disfavours paternalism towards the worse off. The second argument caters to such fairness concerns. It argues that priority or inequality aversion supports age-differentiated paternalism because young people, who act imprudently and thereby risk their interests or well-being, are worse off than older people who act in similar ways. I suggest that both arguments are pertinent in evaluating specific paternalistic acts and policies.",

Specifically, Black people in the United States experience time losses across numerous domains throughout the life course, putting them at risk of disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Fundamental cause theory holds that social conditions structure health through pathways to resources including money, knowledge, power, prestige, freedom, and social networks. Racialized time indirectly harms health by disrupting or denying access to these flexible resources and by undoing utility among those that are obtained. Racialized time harms health directly when it produces stress and exacerbates conditions of racial subordination. I examine racialized time in three categories: 1) Black people spending too much time to meet basic needs; 2) Black people having less time spent on them than is required; and 3) lost years of (good quality of) life. Linkages between time and health disadvantage exist in material resources, interactions with the state, intimate lives, public space, and cognitive processes.",

Of the three types of violence and nonviolence — the cult, the extermination, and the breakdown of threat systems — the third is most important. Nonviolence involves threat in more subtle and less costly ways than does violence. Conflict is relatively unimportant in biological evolution, except in the very indirect sense of unconscious competition; it is more important in social dynamics and operates as a facilitator or a limiter. Most human activity and most developmental processes are nonconflictual, and where conflict exists it is frequently dealt with by ritualization. The control of violence may be achieved more easily by expanding the nonconflictual aspect of human behavior than by trying to substitute nonviolent for violent conflict. The main problem is dialectical thinking in terms of only two alternatives or two parties, which almost always is a gross oversimplification. A “trialectic” of violence, nonviolence, and nonconflict is a much more realistic approach to the problems of the dynamics of society.",

Since the respective state of health can be influenced and shaped to a certain extent by the individual him- or herself, considerations on what can be derived from the fact of human vulnerability for the individual not only lead to the difficult and fundamental problem of determining what the concept of health actually entails and means; through the connection between vulnerability and health, rather, another ethically weighty complex comes into play, which includes questions of responsibility.

      "abstract": "Healthy life expectancy, that is, years without disability or disease, does not match life expectancy. Aging itself is not a disease or disorder, and the aging process (biological, environmental and behavioural) may be modifiable. Certainly, many risk factors for age-related diseases are modifiable – if recognised at an early stage. Furthermore, aging, a heterogeneous concept, may be influenced by childhood events or lifelong factors. A better understanding of the mechanisms of aging processes, recognition of early biomarkers and solutions to improve quality of life and independent living will provide the end user (individual, clinician, society) with means to increase healthy life years, closing the gap between life span and healthy life span. Longitudinal studies on aging afford an opportunity to better understand mechanisms underpinning the aging process. These studies are multidimensional and as such afford an opportunity to explore many hypotheses underpinning the aging process, such as inflammation, genetic predisposition, childhood experiences, socioeconomic status, social engagement and the interactions between these factors. Demographic aging is a global phenomenon and informing and influencing policy and practice will vary enormously between different countries. In this symposium we will highlight new information on epigenetic factors which influence aging, the role of longitudinal studies for original research andpolicy and practice in developing nations and provide a case study of vascular senescence, implications for new technologies for blood pressure and heart rate measurement and impact of modifiable blood pressure behaviours on brain health and mobility.",

      "abstract": "Smartphone addiction is a new phenomenon. It is also one of the most widespread non-medical addictions, which, in its scale, has already left behind Internet addiction and gambling addiction. Many people cannot imagine their life without a smartphone and always keep it with them. Due to the fact that their attention is constantly riveted to their smartphone, most active users cannot fully study or work, establish relationships with others or live a full life. These and other negative consequences of smartphone addiction make it relevant to study this phenomenon. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between smartphone addition and various personality and other traits. The study involved 406 subjects, including 264 women 18–75 years old and 142 men 17–67 years old. The article demonstrates that smartphone addiction for women and men is negatively associated with self-esteem and positively associated with impulsivity, neuroticism, Internet addiction, use of social networks and the habit of using a smartphone before bedtime. All of those dependencies are linear. Smartphone addition in women is much higher than in men. These connections and relationships are the same as those found in foreign studies. However, there is no positive correlation of smartphone addiction with aggressiveness, extraversion, interpersonal conflicts or openness in the Russian-speaking society. Negative correlation of smartphone addiction with the quality of one's relationships with parents and a positive correlation with education in humanities, found in foreign studies, is only present in Russian men. The practical significance of these results is that they can be used in educational work with school and university students. Psychologists at educational institutions and curators of study groups can use these results as the basis for the development and implementation of measures aimed at preventing smartphone addiction in students. The obtained theoretical results can be useful in planning further studies on smartphone addiction, using the proposed method for studying the problem field and conducting a comparative analysis of the results.",

The degree of male financial consumption may be related to variance in life history strategies, as differences in life history patterns are fundamentally differences in the allocation of effort and/or resources. Males who have higher mating intentions may maximize their economic displays, saving little and even spending beyond their capacity through the use of credit. These men may seek and possibly obtain a greater number of sexual partners. This hypothesis was tested in a randomly selected community sample of men aged 18–45 included in a telephone health interview. The degree of financial consumption was directly related to future mating intentions and past mating success, even when accounting for age, years of education completed, and marital status. The degree of financial consumption was not related to future mating intentions or past mating success for women in the same sample.",

They are frequently perceived to engage in activities considered by adults to be immoral, including sexual behavior, delinquent activities, and low-level forms of violence. Yet the vast majority report surprisingly high levels of religiosity. Ninety-five percent of American teens aged 13-17 believe in God or a universal spirit, and 76% believe that God observes their actions and rewards or punishes them. Nearly half engage in religious practices, such as praying alone or attending church or synagogue services. Adolescents' religious beliefs are clearly important to them. Yet, the law does not know how to approach adolescents' religious rights and needs. In Not by Faith Alone , Roger J. R. Levesque argues that teens' search for meaning does not always serve adolescents or society well. Religious doctrines and institutions are not all \"good,\" with violence linked to religious beliefs, for exampleparticularly racial/ethnic and sexual orientation harassmentbecoming an increasing concern. Not by Faith Alone is the first attempt to integrate research on the place of religion in adolescent development and to discuss the relevance of that research for policies and laws which regulate religion in their lives. Levesque asks how religion, broadly defined, influences the development of teens' inner moral compasses, and how we can ensure that religion and the apparent need for \"religious\" activity lead to positive outcomes for individual adolescents and for society.",

      "title": "PREFERENCE FOR AGE-HOMOGENEOUS VERSUS AGE-HETEROGENEOUS SOCIAL INTERACTION",
      "abstract": "A major argument made in favor of age-segregated services is that older people prefer and benefit from age-homogeneous social interaction. Past studies indicate that older people who are attracted to age-segregated services do indeed benefit from them. However, no evidence of a widespread preference for age homogeneous social interaction was found in previous investigations. A review of the theoretical and empirical literature did, however, suggest that a preference for age-homogeneity might be more characteristic of those considered target groups, for social services, such as the old-old, frail, isolated, poor, and minorities. The present study sought to assess this preference through secondary analysis of the national data from The Myth and Reality of Aging survey (Harris, 1975). All respondents 18 years of age or older were asked \"Would you personally prefer to spend most of your time with people about your own age or with people of all different ages?\" Two-thirds of persons under 65 and three-quarters of those 65 or over expressed a preference for interaction with people of all different ages. Among those 65 or over a preference for interaction limited to people ones own age was expressed by significantly higher proportions of males, ethnic minorities, poor, retirees, less educated, those experiencing problems indicative of role loss and need, and those with older age identifications. However, even among these subgroups, a majority still preferred interaction with people of all ages. No difference was found between the young-old and the old-old. Surprisingly, senior center members expressed an even higher preference for interaction with people of all ages than did nonmembers. It is recommended that the high level of interest expressed by both young and old in interacting with people of all ages is promising and should, therefore, be further explored. Optimal conditions conducive to such interaction need to be identified. It is also recommended that age-segregated service providers consider opportunities for cross-generational interaction in the design and planning of these programs. Finally, while age-segregated services are a desirable option for some older persons, they should not be relied upon exclusively to connect those in need with appropriate services. Multiple entry points into the service network should be encouraged.",

Common misunderstandings about the transgressor (such as the assumption of psychopathy and the likelihood of multiple offenses) are countered with a summary of data derived from the evaluation and/or treatment of over two hundred cases, most of them one-time transgressors. The typical characteristics of the analyst or therapist who engages in sexual misconduct are presented and discussed as qualities that are to some extent present in analysts generally. The temptation to deny this universal vulnerability is viewed as effectively replicating the kind of vertical splitting or compartmentalization that makes one vulnerable to sexual misconduct in the first place.",

Vulnerable individuals with psychiatric and/or neuropsychiatric conditions are more at risk for compromise in their relational functional capacity and to be taken advantage of by others.

      "abstract": "This chapter looks at the intersections of homelessness and health by exploring the ways in which the experience of homelessness can influence the social determinants of health. The social quality approach (SQA) is designed to provide a theoretical framework for exploring the relationships between societal participation, health and well-being. Homelessness presents a number of potentially serious risks to mental and physical health. There is evidence of early mortality in some populations of people experiencing homelessness and high prevalence of severe mental illness and addiction, but health research has often looked at people experiencing homelessness on a long-term or repeated basis, who have multiple and complex needs, rather than conduct wider analyses of the whole experience of homelessness. Among people experiencing homelessness, health needs may differ by age, gender and other factors. Using the SQA to explore homelessness as a whole, it is clear that socioeconomic security, living in a socially cohesive community, access to basic social inclusion and social empowerment to develop one's own abilities are all conspicuous by their absence, existing in a mutually reinforcing negative relationship with the absence of an adequate, affordable, settled and stable home. Homelessness represents a set of multidimensional risks to health that extend well beyond the absence of physical shelter.",

      "title": "Who Is A Parent? Intrastate and Interstate Differences",
      "abstract": "When the parental status of one or more people involved in a civil action is contested in a court in the United States, the need for a legal parentage determination arises. Fifty years ago such contests were rare. Today they are common. In these contests, legal parentage can differ from personally and/or publicly perceived parentage. Legal parentage can also differ by context, as between child custody and child support. Legal parentage most often varies by context in a single American state where the purposes behind varying parentage laws differ, as where biology is key in one setting and where parental-like acts are key in another setting. A need for a parentage determination can arise, inter alia, in contests over child custody/visitation/parental responsibility allocation; child support; heirship in probate; and standing to pursue tort remedies. Parental status laws are challenging today because increasingly they no longer operate chiefly due to acts at birth or during a formal adoption. Rather, more frequently parental status under law arises due to acts occurring preconception; postconception but prebirth; or long after birth, but with no formal adoption. Parentage contests are especially challenging when relevant conduct occurs in several states. Family relationships can first be established in one state, be continued in a second state, and only become legally disputed in a third state. For example, an unwed couple can conceive a child via sex in one state, the child can be born in a second state, and the birth mother and child can thereafter move to a third state where a parent status contest first arises. Or, a romantic female couple can first reside in one state, prompt per agreement a pregnancy for one spouse/partner or a surrogate in a second state, and then split up, whereupon one of the women and the child move to a third state where parentage is first contested. This article reflects on the challenges facing judges, lawyers, families, the public at large, and the states interested in legal parentage contests.

      "title": "The Influence of Bush Identity on Attitudes to Mental Health in a Queensland Community",
      "abstract": "There are many factors that impact on mental health and the utilization of these services in the bush. The results from a three year ethnographic study in a bush community indicate that attitudes to mental health in this area of Queensland are influenced by bush identity, defined by reference to historical and current characteristics which include self-reliance, resilience, independence and stoicism. In turn, these incorporated attributes and values have a direct impact on attitudes to mental health and the willingness to seek help for problems of a psychological nature. Other aspects of bush life such as the perceived lack of confidentiality and anonymity, fear of gossip, and isolation also impact on attitudes and the utilisation of mental health resources. Stigma is a significant barrier to the recognition and acceptance of mental health issues. Mental health services, therefore, are not as readily accepted or utilised in this bush community. It can be argued that, without the acknowledgement of the impact of bush identity and culture on attitudes to mental health, many in the bush will continue to suffer in silence and deny the need for treatment.",

      "abstract": "A substantial amount of literature suggests that illness behavior in the United States is a product of a patient's core culture; equally credible findings do not support this contention. Most students and graduates in the health care professions believe that illness and disability behavior are affected by a patient's culture, but they are hard put to find convincing examples of that relationship. In experience with medical students studying the social and cultural bases of illness behavior, with patients who are disabled and with persons who claim disability in the absence of physical disease or disabling psychopathology, I observed no deviant disability behavior that was typical for the members of any cultural group, and no behavior was displayed by the members of one cultural group that was not seen in members of other cultural groups. No cultural stereotypes were upheld. I did find evidence that disability behavior is influenced by personality factors, social situations and the gains derived from the disability status. Evolving concepts of \"entitlement,\" which are closely related to socioeconomic status, also have a significant influence. The impact of feedback from others in a person's many social and medical subcultures is a more crucial determinant of illness and disability behavior, except in those for whom illness and disability behavior is determined by the limitations imposed by the disease or by a personality structure resistant to cultural expectations and social feedback.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Homelessness is a form of extreme poverty characterized by poor health, barriers to accessing health care, and premature death. Homelessness is associated with multiple stigmatized and interlocking identities associated with poverty; substance use and mental illness; disease conditions such as addiction and HIV/AIDS; as well as structural discrimination related to class, gender, age, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. Stigma and discrimination contribute to poor health and the social exclusion of people experiencing poverty and homelessness. Intersectionality is an approach that highlights how multiple identities and structural conditions form interlocking systems of oppression and privilege which benefit some and disadvantage others. Recognizing both constructed and taken‐for‐granted identities highlights the way in which people are positioned in society, especially in relation to policies that constrain choices, structure experiences, and provide access to resources for health and well‐being. Recognizing and challenging multiple constructed identifies and shifting power balances to enhance the social inclusion of people experiencing homelessness is central to addressing the multiple stigmas of homelessness. Structural and systemic discrimination derive from policies that are implicated in the development of homelessness; an understanding of these shifts the responsibility for solving homelessness from individuals to the society in which they live.",

In this chapter, I argue against this view because it\nover-estimates the importance of declining death rates and underestimates that of adverse\ntrends in a range of non-fatal, chronic health problems, both physical and mental. These\nproblems have their sources in quite fundamental features of modern societies, and\noptimizing wellbeing will mean making correspondingly fundamental social and cultural\nchanges.\nYoung people reﬂect best the tenor and tempo of the times because they are growingup in them. Because of their stages of biological and social development, they are also\nmost vulnerable to social risks. Many of the attitudes and behaviours – even the illnesses – that largely determine adult health have their origins in childhood, adolescence\nand early adulthood. So the health of young people shapes the future health of the\nwhole population: their health is not only important in its own right, or for their sake, it\nis crucial to assessing the overall state and fate of societies.\nI deﬁne health very broadly to include all aspects of wellbeing, not just clinical disease,disorder and disability. I use the terms ‘health’ and ‘wellbeing’ somewhat interchangeably\nand sometimes together to emphasize their many dimensions: illness and wellness, physical and psychological, objective and subjective. My focus, however, is on mental health\nand wellbeing; physical health is discussed elsewhere.",

      "abstract": "We tested a model of prosocial development, which predicted that prosocial action might decline, not increase, throughout childhood, becoming increasingly selective, individual, gender-related, and linked to emotional dysregulation. Sixty-six focal children at 18, 24, or 30 months of age were observed at home with familiar peers and then again 6 months later. Episodes of peer interaction were analysed for instances of sharing. The predicted decline in sharing with age was qualified by cohort differences and many associations with gender. Most children shared less as they grew older, but the oldest girls slightly increased their rate of sharing over time. As peer relationships developed, girls were more likely to share with other girls; boys were more likely to show reciprocity in sharing. Individual differences in sharing were moderately stable over time and linked to another form of prosocial action, sensitivity to the peer's distress. As predicted, children who shared at higher rates were rated more negatively by their mothers. The positive relationship between prosocial action and mothers' ratings of negative personality traits was especially strong for boys.",

So, it is rational to ask, what is the point of making kids use decent language with each other and insisting that they do not indulge in bullying in the absence of adults? There are three good reasons to enforce civility when an adult is within earshot. The first reason is about teaching the child good values. Parental rules also have value as a way of teaching the child what an adult thinks is right or wrong. The second reason is that even among nice kids, bad language and smarminess can very easily become a habit. The third reason for enforcing civility and consideration is that the way brothers and sisters treat each other while growing up can influence their emotional impressions of their relationship.",

The WHO has defined 'sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well being in relation to sexuality and it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity' [1]. Good sexual health comprises an absence of sexually transmitted disease (STD), fertility problems and unwanted pregnancies and also the ability to enjoy one's sexuality without abuse and/or oppression [1]. The topic of sex and sexuality in itself is now no longer confined to hushed discussions in the twenty-first century. Yet, there is still anxiety and abstinence when the topic of sex comes up for discussion, especially more so between the clinician and the patient [2, 3].

For example, some people believe that nudges are manipulative; that nudges are hidden or covert; that nudges are difficult to define; that nudges are an insult to human agency; that nudges are based on excessive trust in government; that nudges exploit behavioral biases; that nudges depend on a belief that human beings are irrational; and that nudges work only at the margins, do not affect structures, and cannot accomplish much. These are mistakes. Nudges are generally transparent rather than covert or forms of manipulation; nudges are not difficult to define; nudges always respect, and often promote, human agency; because nudges insist on preserving freedom of choice, they do not put excessive trust in government; many nudges are educative, and even when they are not, they tend to make life simpler and more navigable; and some nudges have quite large impacts. It is true that for countless problems, nudges are hardly enough. They cannot eliminate poverty, unemployment, and corruption. But by itself, any individual initiative - whether it is a tax, a subsidy, a mandate, or a ban - is unlikely to solve large problems. Denting them counts as an achievement.",

Such concerns did not originate from recent technological advances but from the ancient Greeks and Romans who honored health more than life, and the early Christians who honored life more than health. These opposing concepts reflect differing notions of quality of life. Determining the quality of life involves personal issues--the cognitive ability to evaluate one's own life; the perception of a satisfactory state of social, emotional, physical, and mental health; and an acceptable feeling of well-being despite physical limitations. In contrast, and often conflict, are objective evaluations of treatment outcomes, morbidity/mortality statistics, cost/benefit analyses, and age studies performed in an attempt to determine quality of life by persons other than the patient.",

Physical and mental health, and illness-related variables impact upon happiness, though it may be more pronounced by mental illnesses. Positive emotions, resilience, sex and intimacy, and social connectedness are usually associated with happiness, whereas stress, worry, pain, and depression are not. Happier people probably live longer, and there is excess mortality associated with unhappiness; however, many confounding variables exist. Interestingly, in recent years, biological substrates for happiness have been suggested. Genetics, neurotransmitters, specific areas of the brain, and biomarkers have been identified as being associated with the states of happiness. Achieving and maintaining happiness through health appears to have simple messages of being physically active, maintaining good health, preventing and managing illnesses well, having positive emotions, learning to be resilient against stress, and being generous and spiritual. Studies on health and happiness are building up in recent years, providing more insights into their interrelation. Happiness is being used as an outcome measure in clinical interventional trials and other health research, and there is an enhanced scope for its use in common clinical practice.",

The definitions can have important practical consequences, determining the measurements that are monitored by governments and international agencies and the activities that will be supported by resources earmarked to address health disparities/inequalities or health equity. This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups-such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination-systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. (Social advantage refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given category-e.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic group-and all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such health disparities/inequalities.",

Perceived racial harassment is driven by social classifications that extend beyond racial group membership. While race clearly matters, there is also diversity in the harassment experiences of individuals of the same race with diverging organizational, cultural or social experiences. Social prescriptions constraining inter-racial interactions are associated with higher rates of offensive racial encounters and more careerrelated discrimination, while aspects of an installation’s institutional culture also directly affect harassment. Together, these results lend support for a model of racial harassment that encompasses both institutional factors and a multifaceted notion of racial identity.",

Subjective age is the self&amp;mdash;perception of one's own age, it&amp;rsquo;s a subjective age identification. Foreign and domestic studies convincingly show the predictive role of subjective age in life expectancy, somatic health, regulation of vital activity; countering stress and post-stress disorders, as well. Subjective age becomes an intuitive assessment of a person's own resources, possibilities of their reorganization and integration in threatening situations. This is a flexible psychological mechanism for regulating vital activity. Subjective age is considered as a predictor of successful aging, which is important not only for psychology, but also for economics and social policy. The question of the interrelationship between a person's subjective age and indicators of his psychological well-being remains open. Many scientific papers point to the importance of psychological factors, including subjective age, for psychological well-being. At the same time, several longitudinal studies suggest the opposite: health and well-being may be prerequisites for subjective age.&lt;/p&gt;",

The two, however, complement each other in practice. Institutions must be truly socially accountable, which is possible if there is spontaneous SR to the needs, and is fueled by compassion. Compassion in this article is defined as a “feeling for other people’s sufferings, and the desire to act to relieve the suffering.” Compassion has a long history, whereas SA is more recently described concept that follows the historical development of social justice. SR is the moral or ethical duty of an individual to behave in a way that benefits society. Not everyone feels the need to do something for others. Even if the need is felt, there may be a lack of will to act for the needs or to act effectively to fulfill the needs of society. The reasons are many, some visible and others not. SR provides the basis for being compassionate; hence, medical schools need to include SR as a criterion in their admissions process for student recruitment and inculcate compassion in health professions education and health care. By fostering SR and engaging compassion and self-compassion to achieve SA, we can humanize medical education systems and health care.",

      "abstract": "Disability advocacy has been built by challenging ableist prejudice. The same prejudice can be encountered within the disability sector in the shape of dysfunction-driven hierarchies. The lower the dysfunction, the higher the position in the hierarchy ladder. Occupiers of the top rungs change from country to country. Whilst in India, the top tier is occupied by the blind, in other countries, it is persons with physical disability. Persons with intellectual, developmental and psychosocial disability almost uniformly occupy the bottom rungs, often finding their disability colleagues endorsing the same exclusionary statements mouthed by the non-disabled community. The desire to be part of the privileged majority causes this mis-alignment. It is often not understood that this reinforcement of disability exclusion from within strengthens the forces of external exclusion.",

We use the example of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to show that it is necessary for people with cognitive differences to seek legal protection from discrimination within a disability framework. This approach can be problematic because of the stigma that attaches to disability and because of the way that provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) are interpreted. An alternative approach is to treat cognitive and behavioural attributes within a framework that recognises different abilities, rather than starting from a presumptive provision of disability, in much the same way that gender or religious beliefs are treated.",

      "abstract": "This chapter explores aspects of peer culture that are thought to conflict with academic achievement: attitudes and beliefs (about racism and discrimination, peer culture attitudes, and perceptions of opportunities) and behavioral scripts with respect to conflict. In terms of attitudes and beliefs, there is little evidence for oppositional peer cultures and no evidence that perceptions of discrimination lead to low aspirations. The few students who express oppositional attitudes cannot account for the overall low achievement rates, where only a minority of students leave qualified to start a university education. In terms of behavior, teens place much importance on defending self-pride and showing toughness when it comes to conflict with peers, which sometimes end in physical fighting. Engaging in peer conflicts serves two purposes: preventing real, physical violence, because in schools, appearing weak led to being bullied; and also, because it brought peer status by demonstrating self-pride and toughness. These conflicts do not signal defiance of school authorities or opposition to school norms, nor do they stem from a lack of interest in academic excellence. Rather, they are described by teens as inevitable and sometimes necessary responses to situations at school. As with consumption, gender is found to matter. For young men, masculinity is tied to toughness, defending self-pride, and being seen as hip. Pressures of masculinity lead boys to place more importance on maintaining self-pride among peers. This connection makes boys even more invested in peer status than their girl counterparts, for whom femininity is less likely to come into conflict with adult school culture.",

Holistic care for persons with disabilities means the rehabilitation nurse intervenes when problems of sexual function are discovered, observed, or expressed. However, most people with chronic illnesses and disabilities must confront prevalent myths about their sexual nature and abilities. These myths often have their basis in the notion, common in our society, that the only people who are sexual are those who are young and beautiful. People who are obese, old, or do not conform to current standards of sexual attractiveness are usually deemed as asexual or undesirable. These narrow sterotypes have been particularly damaging to physically or mentally disabled people. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities often have special needs regarding their sexual behavior. Most of us will confront chronic illness or disability in our own lives to some degree. In addition, illnss or disability can occur at any age. In this study, I discuss some of the special needs of people with chronic illnesses and disabilities and the methods of coping with those needs. I also discuss some of the sexual concerns that people with chronic illnesses and disabilities have in common, and the assessment of sexual function and nursing strategies through literature review.",

These relations mean an overt action by one partner with a sexual intent ranging from physical fondling to genital contact and/or intercourse. Many legal codes extend the incest restrictions to adopted and/or stepchildren. This definition technically includes prepubertal sex play between siblings. However, curiosity appears to be the motivating factor in the prepubertal age group and clear evidence of the intent for sexual exploitation inappropriate for the children's age is usually lacking. Father-daughter incest, including stepfather-stepdaughter incest, constitutes approximately 75% to 85% of the cases reported. Although brother-sister incest is thought to be the most common form of incestuous behavior, only 15% of the cases reported to the authorities are of this type. Most brother-sister incest represents exploitative sexual behavior rather than age-appropriate mutual curiosity and experimentation. Such sibling incestuous behavior does not cross generational lines and seems, therefore, to be less influenced by the guilt of the incest taboo. In mother-son incest, which is the most uncommon type, the taboo appears to be so strong that one or both of the partners are usually severely emotionally disturbed or psychotic.",

      "abstract": "Increasing use of internet has numerous reflections on relationships. Within the range of chatroom friendship and flirting to shared sexuality, cybersex addiction and criminal behaviours are among the most intriguing. Searching for sexual satisfaction on internet may have a number of functions such as decreasing anxiety and distress; expressing emotions such as loneliness, depression, anger and disappointment; or providing support to not being able to judge the level of intimacy in a realtionship. The incredible ease with which one obtains sexual content on the internet, at home, at the work place or even through mobile phones is one of the most important reason for its widespread prevalence. Another important allure of the cybersex is its anonimity, the relative ease to disguise normally disturbing characteristics and its being mostly ignored by others. It is also low-cost. On the other hand it causes increased social isolation, damages trust in relationships, and causes the individual to seek for help due to dramatic consequences following a period of virtual mirroring, when the feeling of finding a soulmate causes mutual adoration and idealization. This review examines the definition of infidelity in the context of internet use, its characteristics, types and various aspects; its negative consequences on relationships; its effects on couples and families; and treatment alternatives. The problems caused by increasing compulsivity of cybersex are also highlighted.",

      "title": "\"Developing Capacity\": Adolescent \"Consent\" At Work, At Law, And In The Sciences Of The Mind",
      "abstract": "No national consensus exists concerning adolescent capacity to consent to sex. The law gives differing legal significance to adolescent “consent” to teen-adult sex depending upon a variety of factors. In response to an increase in teen sexual harassment cases, this Article examines three subject areas that should inform the debate over the actual meaning of adolescent consent: adolescent development, adolescent sexuality, and child/adolescent sexual abuse. First, new neuroscientific and psychosocial science data suggest that adolescent physical and psychosocial development continue into the third decade of life. Studies reveal that adolescents’ activities influence their physical brain development and growth. In other words, adolescents “hardwire” their experiences into their brains. Second, statistics regarding adolescent sexuality indicate that teens are having sex that is not always completely voluntary. Moreover, parents are often unaware that their children are having sex. * Associate Professor of Law, Indiana University School of LawIndianapolis. J.S.D., Stanford Law School, 2000.

Finally, I am grateful for summer research stipends from Indiana University School of Law-Indianapolis that supported this work. 2 UC Davis Journal of Juvenile Law & Policy Vol. 10:1 Finally, evidence demonstrates that child sexual abuse can permanently and physically disable youth. This Article suggests that the new scientific and statistical evidence should prompt law reform pertaining to teen capacity and consent. It concludes that while adolescents need to exercise their decision-making skills as they mature, they still need protection from adult sexual predators. As the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Roper v. Simmons suggests, we should not presume full capacity where science indicates adolescents are immature and still developing capacity. This Article recommends, in particular, that sexual harassment law should be revised to make teen consent to workplace sex with an adult supervisor voidable by the minor. Courts should find teen-adult sex unwelcome as a matter of law, when the minor alleges sexual harassment. This Article recommends a strict liability civil response to teen sexual harassment, whether or not the teenager once consented to sex with the adult supervisor. In accordance with this Court’s decisions in Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988), and Stanford v.

      "title": "Exploring Societal Interaction with Emerging Technologies",
      "abstract": "Abstract Emerging technologies are an integral part of technological progress in this era. Research in emerging technologies is characterized as having a sudden or persistent impact on society by inducing far-reaching changes in an attempt to influence human quality of life. While scientific progress gets certain amount of leeway when research is concerned, as it is difficult to exactly predict the outcomes of a hypothesis till all avenues are explored, it also faces obstacles when research touches human safety or the concept of human life and dignity. Hence, progress in research of emerging technologies is strongly predisposed to the attitudes of society and perceptions of individuals. These perceptions, however, are prejudiced by political and religious opinions, among other reasons. Strong political opinions regarding emerging technologies might sound as representing the collective morality of individuals in the society, backed by a religious base. However, the basis for individual opinions differ based on multiple factors and the political or public opinion is usually a spin off reaction to majority of the common factors amongst these opinions. These factors include but are not limited to: public policy, political agenda and affiliations, individual morality based on religious beliefs, safety concerns and societal perceptions. Ethical questions that are associated with emerging technologies and the factors influencing individual opinions can be broadly classified as safety and welfare, political and religious agenda, and individual perception. A survey was created as part of a study aimed at ranking these factors that influence individuals in forming an opinion about an emerging technology. The purpose of the study was to provide knowledge that can be used by ethical engineers and scientists into applying innovation and creativity to help society arrive at properly informed middle ground solutions. The survey responders were asked to support or oppose an emerging technology. The opinions of their political leaders and religious leaders were included along with perception or image associated with that research while explaining the potential risks and benefits of the emerging technology. 82% of the responders said that the most important factor that influenced their decision was safety concerns and 61% said that negative or positive image associated with the research was the second factor. The survey ascertained that political and religious objection to emerging technology that seemed to be based on the moral bias of the society neither represent nor fuel the ethical objections to emerging technologies. When ethical debate of whether an emerging technology is road to salvation or disaster waiting to happen, is fueled by society’s perception of that technology, it can be observed that the fundamental cause for deliberation is not just political or religious misinformation. As knowledgeable citizens, the role of ethical engineers and scientists involved in research can be envisaged as going beyond educating society passively and becoming an essential part of helping society establish public policy regarding emerging technologies through properly informing society of the facts. In order for these public policies to move research and development past gridlocks of advancement based on prejudiced perception, they must encompass middle ground solutions.",

For many disabled men, repositioning disability from a personal tragedy to a focus on profound social devaluation lies at the heart of their identity, political commitment and ethics. The apparent contradictions between disabled masculinities and hegemonic masculinity cannot be denied. Hegemonic masculinity emphasizes self-reliance, refuses care, valorizes physical activity, devalues a lack of mobility, and discourages discussions of pain. One of the most common effects of disasters is a significant increase in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which has flow-on effects on newly disabled masculinities. Disasters evoke multiple expressions of disabled masculinities. As a result of such disabling barriers, abjection and the power of normativity, disabled masculinities experience unique social expressions and social location seven though they are shaped by other forms of power such as race, class and gender.",

      "title": "Ending-Life Decisions: Some Disability Perspectives",
      "abstract": "In the forty years since Quinlan, disability has been present in the conversation within medicine, bioethics, and law about the acceptability of death-hastening medical decisions, but it has at times been viewed as an interloper, an uninvited guest to the party, or perhaps the guest whom the host was obliged to invite, but whose presence was not entirely welcomed. Notwithstanding some short-term reversals and counter-currents, the steady arc of end-of-life law during the past four decades has been towards liberalization of ending-life choices by and for patients who are severely compromised or near the end of their lives. During that time, many leading thinkers and activists in the disability community have questioned that liberalization. My sense is that physicians, bioethicists, and lawyers have sometimes viewed disability advocates’ questioning as marginal, if not bordering on the paranoid, or as the product of manipulation by other interest groups. Disability concerns may be perceived as distracting attention from broadly-held values and interfering with progress. As a result, discussions about ending-life decisions within the bioethics, medicine, and law communities and those within the disability community too often proceed along parallel tracks, rather than directly engaging with each other. I contend that, because most ending-life decisions are made by or for disabled persons, persons with disabilities must be included at the center of conversations about the meaning of and limits on those decisions. This essay does two things. First, it briefly describes the nature of and basis for disability concerns about the liberalization of ending-life decisions. This account is largely descriptive and explanatory, summarizing the reasons for the apprehension that many in the disability community experience surrounding treatment termination and physician-aided dying. I offer this account recognizing both that I am not a person with a disability and that people with disabilities have diverse views on these issues. Second, this essay considers how recent conversations about racial justice issues in policing and criminal justice, promoted by the Black Lives Matter movement, among others, might offer parallels to the concerns of disability advocates. To my mind, these parallels help explicate the concerns of disability activists and reveal them as deeply imbued with social justice commitments.",

Age discrimination can be experienced in different life-domains and perceived as a social (others’ experiences) or as a personal phenomenon (own experiences). Our first goal was to examine country- and age-related differences in personal experiences of age discrimination in distinct life domains, reported by 2,817 participants aged 40 to 90 years from the US, China, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Taiwan. As another goal, we investigated the impact of age discrimination on life satisfaction. Personal age discrimination was domain-specific, with more experiences reported in the family, work, and personality domains. Personal age discrimination increased with age and was higher in China and Taiwan. Age discrimination negatively predicted life satisfaction. This negative effect was more pronounced if age discrimination was experienced in domains with high subjective importance.",

This paper estimates the effect of attractiveness on engagement in risky behaviours in adolescence. We find marked effects across a range of risky behaviours with notable contrasts. More attractive adolescents are more likely to engage in underage drink- ing; while they are less likely to smoke, use drugs, or practice unprotected sex.

      "abstract": "In contrast to the male orgasm, female orgasm is characterized by high variability and diversity, not only in the general population, but also during the life. Women experience sexual pleasure on many levels: physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual. Sexual functioning of women and men is determined by many factors. A strong correlation between the state of subjective arousal and genital response (erection) is typical for men. In the case of women important role played: emotions, cognitive interpretation of the situation, age, self-esteem and previous sexual experiences. Among women experience orgasm during intercourse or masturbation is not a goal in itself. Modern approach to the phenomenon of orgasm and sexual education of women, make absence of orgasm as a failure. It becomes a source of low self-esteem, less self-confidence or sense of lack of attractiveness.",

The decisions pertaining to end of life, whether legalized or otherwise, are practiced in many parts of the world but not reported on account of legal implications. Lack of awareness regarding the distinction between different procedures on account of legal status granted to them in some countries is the other area of concern.

At a minimum, illness can be thought of in biological, social, psychological, moral/religious, and probabilistic terms. Various aspects of illness maybe understood to be embedded in a number of explanatory contexts or theories. Any one \"fact\" about illness may involve a number of theories. For example there are several (partial) explanations for why sick children do not go to school. There is a biological rationale: sick people may be contagious and so may contaminate others they contact. There is also a social prohibition. It is a social norm that sick people are released from certain obligations and enjoined to others: one gets to stay home and should avoid making others ill. There also may be a psychological rationale: sick people feel bad and weak and so do not want to go to school.",

      "abstract": "The possible association between heavy drinking and intoxication with aggression and violence has been debated for centuries. A select and concise review of some of the evidence on this topic will be presented. This seeks to draw some general conclusions from an extensive, flawed and often contradictory literature. The main focus of this review is on social and contextual factors. Experimental evidence suggests that alcohol consumption probably does increase the propensity for aggression in men, but less so for women. The effects of drinking depend upon the alcohol consumed, the drinker and the setting in which consumption occurs. Most drinking occasions do not result in aggression or violence, and drinking is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause violence. Heavy and inappropriate drinking is associated with both violent and nonviolent crimes; heavy and problem drinkers are at risk of being violent or of being the victims of violence. Experience of violence (including sexual abuse) in childhood or later in life are associated with the development of heavy or problem drinking. The risk of exposure to violence is influenced by a host of demographic, lifestyle and contextual factors. Responses to alcohol-related violence at the societal level involve a number of harm minimization strategies. At an individual level it has been shown that treatment for problem drinking can lead to reduced risk levels (for both perpetrators and victims of violence).",

      "abstract": "For social species, having strong and high-quality social relationships is an important safety cue. Loneliness occurs when an individual perceives they have insufficient relationships resulting in feelings of lack of safety. States of perceived unsafety are linked to an increased tendency to construe ambiguous information—information lacking a unique clear interpretation--as threatening. Here, we explore whether the ambiguity of social cues of interpersonal rejection moderates effects of loneliness on feelings of rejection while undergoing social exclusion. Data were collected in 2021; 144 adults completed a progressive social exclusion paradigm where they were randomly assigned to be equally included, excluded, or over-included. Social exclusion/inclusion cues became more pronounced over the course of multiple rounds of a ball-tossing game (Cyberball) resulting in a scenario where ambiguity was highest in earlier rounds and decreased over time. Participants reported feelings of loneliness prior to the task and feelings of rejection throughout the task. Results demonstrated that higher loneliness predicted increased feelings of rejection regardless of exclusion condition. Notably, this positive relationship was strongest during earlier rounds when social cues were most ambiguous. These findings contribute to our understanding of how loneliness modulates social perception to enable organisms to adequately adapt to changing circumstances.",

      "title": "The social and emotional profiles of adolescent bullies, victims, and bully-victims",
      "abstract": "Peer bullying is a highly prevalent issue for children and adolescents worldwide. There is now convincing evidence that bullying has adverse consequences for physical, psychological, social, and emotional health that last throughout adolescence and into adulthood. Despite heightened efforts to prevent and tackle bullying, the factors that motivate this behaviour, and may predispose individuals to being either the perpetrators or victims of bullying remain partly unclear. With focus on the perpetration of bullying, one possible motivation described by resource control theories, is the pursuit of social dominance and enhancing status within the peer group. Bullies have been described as popular although controversial in their social acceptance. However there has been little exploration of how this group compares to victimised adolescents, and in particular to those who are concurrently victimised and bully others (bully-victims). Differences in sociometric outcomes between bullies and bully-victims, or between these perpetration roles and those who are ‘pure’ victims or uninvolved, may be explained by differences in social-cognitive and emotional attributes. Bullies were historically portrayed as socially incompetent and thought to show deficiencies in their emotional functioning. However the strategic and manipulative behaviour of bullies suggests that this group may be relatively skilled in their processing of social information and understanding of others. It may be bully-victims who display the most deficiencies in their social and emotional functioning, and this may be fundamental in explaining their failure to gain the same social status as bullies. \r\n\r\nThree studies were conducted, in which adolescents were first screened for bullying involvement using both self-reports and peer-nominations, and completed measures for behavioural problems, self-esteem, and peer-reported sociometric status. Participants were assigned to a bullying role (bully, bully-victim, victim or uninvolved), and a sub- sample of participants were assessed on abilities in the early stages of social information processing (encoding and interpretation) and emotional attributes (empathy, callous-unemotional traits, and affective instability). Study one investigated differences between the bullying roles on levels of social impact, social acceptance, and perceived popularity. It was found that all adolescents involved in bullying had higher social impact than those uninvolved. Bullies had the highest levels of perceived popularity, whereas bully-victims, like victims, scored low on perceived popularity and had the lowest levels of social acceptance. Additionally, bullying role made the greatest contribution compared to other demographic and individual characteristics in predicting all aspects of sociometric status. \r\n\r\nStudy two explored the differences in abilities between the bullying roles on the encoding and interpretation stages of social information. There were no differences found between the groups with regards to emotion recognition abilities (encoding), however the victimised groups exhibited the most interpretation biases. Bully-victims showed the most hostile attribution biases, whereas victims endorsed more characterological self-blame attributions. Bullies showed no differences to uninvolved adolescents in their accuracy for encoding and interpreting social information. Finally study three investigated whether those involved in bullying showed differences in emotional traits and attributes. Those who were victimised, i.e., victims and bully- victims, had high levels of affective instability, and bully-victims also had the lowest levels of empathy and the most callous-unemotional traits. Bullies also had high levels of callous-unemotional traits, however showed no differences to the uninvolved group on any other emotional measure. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, bullies were associated with the most positive attributes across the measures of sociometric status, and did not differ in social information processing and emotional attributes from those uninvolved in bullying; however they were found to be callous-unemotional. This supports resource control approaches in suggesting that bullying is used to acquire dominance in the peer group, which in turn reinforces the bullying behaviour. Bullies’ social and emotional skills, in combination with being callous in pursuit of social status, may account for the ability to successfully use a combination of coercive and prosocial strategies to gain this social dominance. If bullies experience such social rewards, i.e., increased popularity, their behaviour will ultimately be more difficult to change. In contrast, bully-victims showed low sociometric status, showed the most interpretation biases, and the most negative emotional attributes. These adolescents are likely to represent the ineffective aggressors whose poor social skills, reactive behaviour, and dysregulated emotional style, explains their lack of success in gaining social dominance, along with their increased victimisation and rejection by peers. Interventions should target the whole peer group in reducing the social rewards received by bullies and encourage prosocial means for enhancing social status. Social hierarchies in schools should also be addressed to increase the status of those who are victimised and provide the social support needed to reduce victimisation. Finally, interventions may benefit from considering the emotional traits and processing biases that increase the risk of involvement in bullying, and may ultimately influence the outcomes of those involved.",

Homicide is defined as the killing of a human being by another human being. Not all homicides are illegal. At the top of the scale of crimes relating to homicide is murder in the first degree. At the other end of the scale are excusable and justifiable homicides, which are not subject to punishment under the law. The common law crime of murder is defined as “the unlawful killing of a human being by another human being with malice aforethought.” At common law, and in some states, there are no degrees of murder.

People with predominantly cyclical cultural perceptions of time tend to see life and death as part of an eternal movement. Severity and persistence of mental trauma are not directly related to the magnitude of the catastrophe or even of the traumatic experience, but rather to the way they pervade the mind and to the roles they represent on it. Modern culture tends to produce individuals prepared to a highly complex world, running in a frantic rhythm and under constant pressure. Nearly all events must be anticipated, planned or controlled, and obsessive traits tend to be facilitated. However, in catastrophic, unpredictable events, when nothing can be done, these full-schedule people may show frailty and despair. Traditional communities seem capable to bear extremely high levels of aggression or suffering - in traumatic and catastrophic situations - without showing proportional signs of mental stress. While in the high social layers of modern communities an act of violence as an assault or rape may have serious and long lasting consequences, in everyday public hospital practice we come across victims of potentially traumatic events without any of the expected devastating effects on their mental life. Periodic dissociative rituals may have a role in their resilience.",

This conviction is held and persists despite the painfully obvious fact of normal male anatomy and genitalia, before and after puberty, and in the absence of delusional ideation or psychosis in the majority of transsexuals studied. He is disgusted with the development of his primary and secondary sexual characteristics, to the point where the male transsexual frequently contemplates and occasionally performs self-mutilation of his genitalia. He prefers normal, heterosexual men as sexual partners, and rejects homosexual men or the idea that his sexual activity is homosexual. Feeling he belongs to the female gender, he considers it appropriate to have a love relationship with a man, and he feels “unnatural” in a relationship with a woman, considering this “homosexual.” There is some evidence that sex or overt sexual activity, whether it be considered homosexual or heterosexual, plays a minor or secondary role. The transsexual may decide to pass and become accepted as a female, either before or after sex reassignment surgery, depending upon individual circumstances. The postoperative results of 121 male transsexuals who have obtained sex reassignment surgery are reviewed. A satisfactory outcome, as indicated by improved social and emotional adjustment, is 10 times more likely than an unsatisfacory result. Improvement is enhanced if the transsexual has functional use of an artificial vagina, obtains a legal change of gender status and freely passes in society as a member of the opposite sex. At the present time one is impressed with the lack of success in attempting to alter gender identity, once established, by traditional psychotherapy. This fact, together with the apparent success of sex reassignment surgery, compels one to accept the surgical treatment of transsexualism on an experimental basis until the initial results can be verified or contradicted or until alternative treatment procedures prove successful.",

      "title": "Choosing not to choose.",
      "abstract": "Choice can be an extraordinary benefit or an immense burden. In some contexts, people choose not to choose, or would do so if they were asked. In part because of limitations of \"bandwidth,\" and in part because of awareness of their own lack of information and potential biases, people sometimes want other people to choose for them. For example, many people prefer not to make choices about their health or retirement plans; they want to delegate those choices to a private or public institution that they trust (and may well be willing to pay a considerable amount to those who are willing to accept such delegations). This point suggests that however well accepted, the line between active choosing and paternalism is often illusory. When private or public institutions override people's desire not to choose and insist on active choosing, they may well be behaving paternalistically, through a form of choice-requiring paternalism. Active choosing can be seen as a form of libertarian paternalism, and a frequently attractive one, if people are permitted to opt out of choosing in favor of a default (and in that sense permitted not to choose); it is a form of nonlibertarian paternalism insofar as people are required to choose. For both ordinary people and private or public institutions, the ultimate judgment in favor of active choosing, or in favor of choosing not to choose, depends largely on the costs of decisions and the costs of errors.",

      "title": "Why do People Suffer from Eating Disorders? A Critical Evaluation of the Contemporary Etiological Models of Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Eating disorders is one of the most prominent health issues among adolescents not only in the West but also in non-Eastern countries like India. Its higher prevalence during adolescence is often seen as a form of defense against the demands for greater autonomy and responsibility during this period of transition and often linked with stress as the key variable. However, empirical studies attribute this to the changing patters of family dynamics during adolescence. Whereas, in contrast to this, the psychiatric morbidity model suggests that, eating disorders are seen as manifestation of psychological disturbances such as major depression and obsessivecompulsive disorders, at some point of time, as these disorders are almost three times more common among patients, particularly, with anorexia nervosa. Whereas, addictive models of eating disorders suggest that, eating disorders are driven by compulsion to eat or avoid eating in spite of either satiation or deprivation, respectively in obesity and anorexia nervosa, whereas sociocultural models emphasize social and familial expectations as well as social desirability as the driving force. Psychoanalytic models on the other hand focus on the underlying unconscious motives at the core of eating disorders, and cognitive models, on the underlying thoughts and belief systems, whereas, the biological models have attributed eating disorders to genetics and biochemistry. The article attempts to critically evaluate these prevalent contemporary models of eating disorders.",

      "title": "Disability and Population Ethics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Population ethics is concerned with the evaluation of populations that vary in terms of the identity, number, or well-being of the individuals that compose them. The ethics of disability focuses on, among other things, the evaluation of the lives of people with disabilities and decisions concerning current and future disabled individuals. The ethics of disability raises philosophically interesting questions, some of which fall directly within the scope of population ethics. Some people with disabilities have sometimes, as a group, lower average well-being than other salient social groups. Moreover, the size of disabled populations is susceptible to change due to, for example, the availability of reproductive technologies. Given their theoretical similarities, the ethics of disability inherits some of the problems that arise in population ethics. This chapter presents and analyzes some of those problems, focusing on three in particular: (1) problems of procreation where the person created is disabled, (2) problems involving the infliction or removal of a disability, and (3) problems involving changes in the size of the disabled population.",

Those who are subordinate experience it as constraining, often humiliating and sometimes life-threatening; and many would escape it if they could. Those who hold power, or seek to do so, are themselves frequently at odds with one another over the scope of their power and the control over their subordinates, with potentially damaging consequences. Power, in other words, is a highly problematical, as well as recurrent feature of human societies. And because it is so problematical, societies will seek to subject it to justifiable rules, and the powerful themselves will seek to secure consent to their power from at least the most important among their subordinates. Where power is acquired and exercised according to justifiable rules, and with evidence of consent, we call it rightful or legitimate.",

      "abstract": "A police officer sees a suspicious bulge in the pocket of a passing pedestrian and deliberates whether to stop and search. The pedestrian is also a young, black man and from past searches and convictions the police arguably know that such men are much likelier than other people to carry an illegal firearm. Should the police officer be instructed to take this information into account? This paper objects to racial profiling because it relies on the following type of inference: from the individual’s membership of a certain racial group, the searcher is invited to infer that he is likelier to exhibit some culpable behaviour. The paper shows that such an inference to culpable behaviour requires contradictory presuppositions about the freedom of the suspected behaviour. On the one hand, racial profiling ought to presuppose that the individual suspect’s behaviour is unfree because the inference it involves takes the suspect’s behaviour to be determined by his race, age and gender, none of which is within his control. On the other hand, similarly to criminal trials, search practices also ought to presuppose the exact opposite: that the individual is free to determine her own behaviour. If the suspected behaviour is free, the involved inference to culpable behaviour is not probative of the individual suspect’s behaviour, so profiling methods which rely on it are useless. And if the suspected behaviour is unfree, the inference is probative but the suspect is not culpable and should thus not be put to trial, whatever the profiled-search yields.",

      "title": "A Social Studies Curriculum for Inquiry.",
      "abstract": "most of the twentieth century, certainly since the progressive era of education, theorists in social studies have stated and elaborated theories on problem solving, critical thinking, reflective thinking, and inquiry. Some of these theoretical propositions have been translated into curriculum plans and teaching methods to be taught to the young of the society. New generations of critically minded and inquiring citizens were envisioned as the consequence of the application of these ideas in schools. Those envisioned consequences have indeed occurred, albeit imperfectly. Students today are questioning and challenging traditional patterns, relationships, and roles. However, there is less than perfect evidence that what the schools have done has been a significant cause. That these questions and challenges have emerged from processes of critical inquiry learned in school seems less probable than their emergence from the abrasions of authority or from the youths' single minded disgust with the hard and prolonged rituals of adolescence. It would seem as probable that the surliness of youth is explainable by the application of an old principle to the effect that disaffection with the old order occurs largely in times of increasing affluence and rising expectations, when those without power see less faintly the possibility of assuming authority roles in the society. Such times, they say, are preceded by a certain loosening of the lines of power and an uneasiness or reluctance among the power elite to apply the old sanctions. The analogy has some faithful elements, at least. But the task here is to speculate on a more effective series of social studies experiences for a new generation rather than to commiserate over the failures of such experiences in the past. The intention, however, will be to recognize the nature of these failures in order to avoid their repetition in our reconstruction. As was mentioned in the first sentences of this paper, the basic theoretical grounds for an inquiry curriculum have been adequately developed and stated. These statements include such",

      "abstract": "Since the foundation of the United Nations at the conclusion of the Second World War, the issue of human rights protection has been persistently addressed in numerous international human rights documents and conventions. Human rights are, in a nutshell, the fundamental, multifaceted, and inalienable rights that primarily evolved from notions of self-respect. They are innate to all humans from birth and are freely accessible to everyone regardless of religion, caste, color, sex, gender, ethnicity, etc. Hence by virtue of this pervasive norm, human rights are also available even to the least dignified members of our society who usually remain detained in prisons. But it has been witnessed quite often that because of the physical and mental torture which the prisoners suffer at the hands of the prison officials and due to the poor prison health infrastructure their Mental Health care needs which is an important facet of Right to well-being and health is being violated continuously as a result of which many prisoners commit suicides and further become incompetent to live a healthy and dignified life whenever they are released from prisons. Prisons exemplify an inhuman cycle of psychological disorders and human rights violations. Due to the dearth of any mental support inside prisons, this situation often leads to deterioration of mental health of prisoners which can cause serious impairments and disabilities. In India, prison-based mental health services are in a very primitive level. As a result, mental health legislation can serve as a valuable weapon for protecting the rights of detained persons suffering from a mental condition; yet, mental health regulations in India continue to fall short of addressing the mental health requirements of the prison population.",

This is especially true of laws and policies that govern reproductive decision-making for adolescents. In my view, these laws and policies must be reformed to permit adolescents to make and to carry out the decisions that govern the sexual and reproductive aspects of their lives. Otherwise, efforts to prevent further horizon tal and vertical spread of HIV/AIDS will be significantly impeded. The prevailing liberal view in this society has been that individuals should have freedom of choice in reproductive matters. Whether and how to reproduce has been a private matter with which government and health-care providers should not interfere. A darker reality, however, has existed alongside this view. A persistent belief that in some circumstances individuals should not be permitted to reproduce or should be strongly discouraged from doing so also endures. A challenge posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic is whether being HIV-infected is such a circumstance.",

Hence, miscarriages and failures to conceive can feel devastating. The fact that friends of the same age are having children can heighten these strains. Men with little or no sperm often feel guilty, ashamed, and less “macho” and are uncomfortable discussing infertility, even with their doctors, hampering communication and referrals.

      "abstract": "Late modernity’s binary intrigue of child sexuality/abuse is understood as a backlash phenomenon reactive to a general trans‐Atlantic crisis concerning the interlocking of kinship, religion, gender, and sexuality. Tellingly dissociated from 1980s gay liberation and recent encounters between queer theory and kinship studies, the child abuse theme articulates modernity’s guarded axiom of tabooed incest and its projected contemporary predicament “after the orgy”—after the proclaimed disarticulation of religion‐motivated, kin‐pivoted, reproductivist, and gender‐rigid socialities. “Child sexual abuse” illustrates a general situation of decompensated nostalgia: an increasingly imminent loss of the child’s vital otherness is counterproductively embattled by the late modern overproduction of its banal difference, its status as “minor.” Attempts to humanize, reform, or otherwise moderate incest’s current “survivalist” and commemorative regime of subjectivation, whether by means of ethical, empirical, historical, critical, legal, or therapeutic gestures, typically trigger the latter’s panicked empiricism. Accordingly, most “critical” interventions, from feminist sociology and anthropology to critical legal studies, have largely been collusive with the backlash: rather than appraising the radical precariousness of incest’s ethogram of avoidance in the face of late modernity’s dispossessing analytics and semiotics, they tend to feed its state of ontological vertigo and consequently hyperextended, manneristic forensics.",

There were four different types of stories: magical stories violating ordinary causal regularities; religious stories also violating ordinary causal regularities but via a Divine agent; unusual stories not violating ordinary causal regularities but with an improbable event; and realistic stories not violating ordinary causal regularities and with no improbable event. Overall, children were less likely to judge that religious and magical stories could really happen than unusual and realistic stories although religious children were more likely than secular children to judge that religious stories could really happen. Irrespective of background, children frequently invoked causal regularities in justifying their judgments. Thus, in justifying their conclusion that a story could really happen, children often invoked a causal regularity whereas in justifying their conclusion that a story could not really happen, they often pointed to the violation of a causal regularity. Overall, the findings show that children appraise the likelihood of story events actually happening in light of their beliefs about causal regularities. A religious upbringing does not impact the frequency with which children invoke causal regularities in judging what can happen, even if it does impact the type of causal factors that children endorse.",

      "abstract": "At any given moment in time, age group differences can be the result of three overlapping processes:1) Life cycle effects: young people may be different from older people today, but they may well become morelike them tomorrow, once they themselves age. 2) Period effects: major events (wars; social movements;economic downturns; medical, scientific or technological breakthroughs) affect all age groups simultaneously,but the degree of impact may differ according to where people are located in the life cycle. 3) Cohort effects:period events and trends often leave a particularly deep impression on young adults because they are stilldeveloping their core values; these imprints stay with them as they move through their life cycle. Macedonianyoung generation belongs to the Millennial generation (born between 1981-2000). There are a lot of beliefsabout this generation cohort, which are based upon empirical findings that characterize its members as veryenthusiastic and tolerant people, with high self-esteem, highly educated, technologically skilled, with greatexpectations from work, career and life in general. They value their parents’ opinions very highly, they supportand believe in social rules, and are more in line with their parents’ values than most other generations have been.The focus on getting good grades, hard work, and involvement in extracurricular activities, etc. is resulting inhigher achievement levels. They see college as the key to a high paying job and success, and may miss thebigger picture of what a college education is all about. They are pressured to decide early on a career – and havebeen put on a career track orientation since grade school. Their focus is more on the world of achievement ratherthan personal development. The Macedonian Millennials during their childhood and adolescence were witnessesof many significant events in their nearby surrounding but also in the globe. Therefore one of our researchquestions was to investigate which events are remembered as the most positive and most negative ones, whichleft mark on their personality and life in overall. Another intention was to investigate what is their preferredlifestyle and what are their aspirations. This paper is a result of a cross-sectional qualitative research study aboutthe Macedonian youth, which was conducted in September 2016, by a research project team from the Institutefor Sociological, Political and Juridical Research, University “Ss.

      "abstract": "This study was an investigation of children's understanding that others' judgments of the self can be based on the actions of another person with whom one is associated. Five-, 8-, and 11-year-old children in Scotland were presented with hypothetical scenarios that indicated that they were responsible for a toddler who breached normative expectations of behavior. The children were required to make a variety of judgments, most notably concerning their likely emotion and its causes, and what others would think of them. The majority recognized that others would make negative judgments of the self. However, emotional self-attributions indicated that only among the 11-year-olds was there a widespread tendency to be self-punitive-that is, to attribute reflexive emotions such as embarrassment. Particularly among the 5-year-olds, punitive responses (e.g., anger) were directed only at the norm-violating toddler, implying that, unlike the oldest children, they did not view the toddler as constituting part of their extended identity. Eight-year-olds appeared to represent an intermediate step between the younger and older groups. In the light of these findings it is suggested that a mature form of extended identity may be a relatively late development.",

For example, evolving societal attitudes support the equal right of persons with physical disabilities to sexual intimacy, even if the means by which to fulfill this right (e.g., accessible social clubs) remain elusive. By contrast, persons with intellectual disabilities seeking volitional sex still face multitudinous attitudinal barriers.",

      "title": "Management of joyful living for ageing people",
      "abstract": "Our second innings start when we retire from ‘active’ work life. Retirement brings with it a mixed feeling. The feeling could be that of leisure and freedom or boredom and isolation. Retirement may change our attitude towards ourselves as well as others. It may affect our identity and relationship. Some think we are no longer ‘useful.’ In the mid of last century retirement was seen as rest, by the 80’s it had become a reward, and by the 90’s leisure became the predominant choice. In the present setting the idea of ‘extended period of leisure’ is not the choice of many; people want to practice ‘active ageing’. And this is possible, thanks to healthier lifestyle and new opportunities. What criteria should be followed to decide if one is ‘young’ or ‘old’? A physically ‘old’ person can be ‘mentally’ young and vice versa. We cannot stop physical ageing, but we can stop to age mentally, and may even reverse it, and become ‘childlike’. We get to know our inner world. We begin to realize the futility of projecting ourselves with too much make-up and begin to enjoy life again. The paper shows that longevity requires a strong cohesiveness between the body, the mind, and most importantly, the spirit. The spirit, being a direct connection to God's energy, is an ever-present source of vitality. The body is a tool that enables us to interact on this physical plane of existence. The mind permits to learn and better ourselves which is a tremendous aid in connecting the spiritual and the physical sides of ourselves. The strength, power and efficiency of old age is to benefit others with the treasure of experience.",

According to concern to the children in the heteronormative society, I explore the role of lesbian mothers raising an adolescent child which goes to Primary School. Dealing with the case of study, I collect data on descriptive level. The findings demonstrate that lesbian relationship is not lasting short and due to that threatening for a child. Jealousy among partners makes relationship uncertain. Lesbian mothers are not raising a gay, child has no emotional difficulties, is enough self-esteem, no too gentle and too sensitive. A student is an ordinary teenage, self-initiative included in diversity of activities. At the sociometry pupil reaches medium sociometric status, his social preference is average and social influence high. A child is controversial and assertive. Furthermore, division of labour by gender is not known in this family. That is also reason for boy choosing typical female profession. Strategy of positionism is not means for mother's operating in school; teachers also consider it as unwanted. Experience with queer family in school sphere is important for non-structural and non-institutional violence. Homophobia is also not present. Teachers are not qualified for teaching about homosexuality, but they feel autonomous about it. Clearly written aim in the curriculum and a person who will protect teachers from hetenormative reaction of parents are not needed.",

      "abstract": "Early social experiences can affect the development and expression of individual social behaviour throughout life. In particular, early-life social deprivations, notably of parental care, can later have deleterious consequences. We can, therefore, expect rearing procedures such as hand-raising-widely used in ethology and socio-cognitive science-to alter the development of individual social behaviour. We investigated how the rearing style later affected (a) variation in relationship strength among peers and (b) individuals' patterns of social interactions, in three captive groups of juvenile non-breeders consisting of either parent-raised or hand-raised birds, or a mix of both rearing styles. In the three groups, irrespectively of rearing style: strongest relationships (i.e., higher rates of association and affiliations) primarily emerged among siblings and familiar partners (i.e., non-relatives encountered in early life), and mixed-sex and male-male partners established relationships of similar strength, indicating that the rearing style does not severely affect the quality and structure of relationships in young ravens. However, compared to parent-raised ravens, hand-raised ravens showed higher connectedness, i.e., number of partners with whom they mainly associated and affiliated, but formed on average relationships of lower strength, indicating that social experience in early life is not without consequences on the development of ravens' patterns of social interaction. The deprivation of parental care associated with the presence of same-age peers during hand-raising seemed to maximize ravens' propensity to interact with others, indicating that besides parents, interactions with same-age peers matter. Opportunities to interact with, and socially learn from peers, might thus be the key to the acquisition of early social competences in ravens.",

      "abstract": "Even if we have epistemic responsibility, exculpatory reasons exist for holding undesirable beliefs. One of the most important of these is ignorance. While a variety of ignorances exist, some ignorance is a socially constructed obfuscatory practice. When this occurs, individuals may not reasonably be expected to know any better—and if we can't know better, then there is an important sense in which we are not responsible. In systemically racist or sexist societies where those beliefs are built into the epistemic practices of the community, individual epistemic agents might just have good epistemic reasons to hold undesirable beliefs. We can ask, however, to what extent we are obligated to overcome socially constructed ignorance. While it is surely impossible for us to challenge all our biases, it is possible for us to challenge some of them. There are occasions when we encounter other epistemic communities with beliefs that challenge our; there are times when we encounter evidence that potentially undermines the beliefs we hold. That there may be some specific instances of exculpation does not mean all socially constructed ignorance is always exculpatory. Each of us has an epistemic responsibility, but not each of us has the same epistemic responsibility.",

      "abstract": "If sociomedical research is to move beyond the stage of repeatedly reporting correlations between social variables and disease, a viable conceptualization of the connection between social and physiological variables must be developed. We suggest that subjective interpretations of information perceived in a situation as congruous or incongruous with learned expectations is the key point of articulation. Each individual has an information repertoire derived from social interaction and direct contact with the non-social environment. If the individual's perceptions of the situation are not congruous with his information repertoire, he is likely to experience activation of the autonomic nervous system and related neuroendocrine and somatic processes. If these physiological processes are intense and/or prolonged enough, they may alter the body's resistance to infectious organisms, temporarily or irreversibly damage the body or reduce behavioral efficiency, increasing the likelihood of accidents. At the same time, encountering of information incongruities may lead to rejection by the individual of the source of the invalidated information. If this source is a social network, the member may become alienated from the network. If this alienation is shared by others, it may lead to social change. Social communication networks protect their members from incongruities by teaching them correct information, by isolating them from incongruous information, by explaining incongruities encountered so they are no longer perceived as incongruous, and by providing means of relieving tensions produced by encounters with incongruities.",

      "abstract": "More than a decade has passed since the landmark High Court decision in Marion’s Case,1 where the Court authorised the sterilisation of a young woman who suffered from a disability. Recently, the principles established in that case were applied by the Family Court in a different context – for the provision of hormonal treatment for a 13 year old child,2 some aspects of which are irreversible. Previously, the Family Court had authorised gender reassignment surgery for a child suffering from a physical, congenital condition,3 but notably in Re Alex, the subject child suffered no identified physical condition indicating treatment, but from an identified psychological condition, gender identity dysphoria. This article considers the issues raised by recent applications of the principles relating to the capacity of children to consent to medical treatment, including the decision in Re Alex and the application of those principles to transgender and intersex children. While not all children or adults who identify as transgender or intersex choose the long and difficult path of gender reassignment, some will choose surgical gender reassignment or hormonal treatment at some stage of their lives. In cases where it is proposed that a minor undergo such treatment, the application of the principles of child consent poses particular difficulties.",

There are three obvious ways in which it might be thought that moral claims could be age related.\n\nOne is that the strength of the claims might be thought to vary with elapsed time, that they might diminish (or increase) in proportion to the amount of lifetime an individual had experienced or “consumed”.\n\nThe second concerns not lifetime lived, but lifetime in prospect. It is often thought that moral claims vary with life expectancy, in proportion to the amount of life an individual has left or (more likely) is reasonably expected to have left. This will always be related to elapsed time but may also arise through illness, injury or indeed genetic constitution.\n\nFinally many think that moral claims are legitimately varied by quality of life considerations—for example, …",

      "abstract": "Tactics used to perpetrate sexual violence may be crucial to understanding when and why sexual violence occurs. Moreover, most sexual violence occurs between people who know each other—including in the context of dating or sexual relationships. Little is known about the context of sexual violence that occurs with non-romantic partners. To address these research gaps, we examined online survey data from 786 young adults (weighted n = 763) aged 19 to 27 years, living across the United States. Findings suggest that 60% of sexual assault, 40% of attempted rape, 42% of rape, and 67% of coercive sex were perpetrated against a romantic partner, defined as a current or ex-boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse, or domestic partner. Contextual differences were noted by relationship type: Those who perpetrated against romantic partners were more likely than those who targeted non-romantic partners to report that it occurred because they were feeling sad or angry. They were also more likely to say that the other person was completely responsible for what happened. Conversely, those who aggressed against non-romantic partners were more likely to say that someone else found out about what happened. Making the other person feel guilty was the most common tactic for both groups. The most frequently endorsed reason for perpetrating sexual violence was “feeling really horny,” although feeling “good” or being drunk/high were also common reasons noted by aggressors. Afterward, many said they felt guilty or ashamed and were worried about the other person’s feelings. Fear of getting caught was universally absent. Findings support the importance of building emotion regulation and emotional awareness skills in sexual violence prevention programming. Prevention programs should also discuss coercion as a violence tactic, since perpetrators may not always recognize this to be sexual violence. More generally, violence prevention programs should also address healthy relationships, consent, and taking responsibility.",

However, even 6‐ and 7‐year‐olds had some difficulty grasping the relation between critical or unambiguous evidence and knowledge, and in basing their ascriptions of knowledge exclusively on the availability of such evidence. Two important transitions in epistemological understanding were observed. The first at about 5#fr1/2> years of age was the transition from ascribing beliefs to others on the basis of one's own beliefs to ascribing them on the basis of the evidence available to that person—a transition that may depend on their understanding of the possibility of someone holding a false belief; the second was the transition from 6 to 7 years of age when they begin to understand the implications of critical evidence.",

      "title": "Violence in sports",
      "abstract": "Sport, as an important socio-cultural phenomenon, fascinates so many people because it performs its compensatory function as an opposite pole to the killing stereotype of the “predictability of life”. Sometimes violence and bad behaviour in sports can be understood as an effective way of bringing about victory. Thus, the medialized top-level sports that are attractive to spectators are seen as a possible outlet for human aggression: today’s medialized sports provide an experience of suspense rather than relaxation. In this context, four basic types of violence within the field of sports should be mentioned: brutal physical contact, borderline violence, semi-criminal violence and criminal violence. Strength-requiring highperformance sports sometimes use harsh physical contact in various manifestations of violence, brutality or intimidation as a part of the game strategy. Criminal or semi-criminal behaviour is condemned, while brutal physical contact on the verge of violence has become part of the rules of the game.The existence of violence among spectators evokes a number of questions. Perhaps the most cardinal one is: does sport provoke violence among spectators/viewers? Today, attention is paid to negative phenomena in the field of sports, particularly in the context of various forms and manifestations of deviation. However, it has to be taken into account the fact that diverse socio-cultural environments evaluate the same phenomena or behaviour in different ways, and consequently also apply different criteria regarding what constitutes deviation. In the field of sport, deviation is a behaviour that grossly violates the principles of fair play since it is a behaviour that is aggressive, often unlawful but tolerated, and in many cases is inflicted on purpose.As a symbol of the ideas of society, sport is seen as one of the most important markers of the identity of today’s world. Be it parents of children doing sports, fans of “their” teams, trainers of athletes: they all express typical emotions reflecting the present importance of sport. Tears of defeat and euphoria of victory provide evidence of the passion of sport. Captivated TV viewers, people crowding in front of giant open-air screens, the “boiling cauldrons” of sport stadiums, all these illustrate today’s culture of sports, and the nature of our contemporary world. It has been suggested that for fans of sport who are usually passive as regards physical exercise, sport can also create a source of grudges and hostility. Fanship in the field of top-performance sport that is attractive to the media (but also outside its framework) may both bring people together and also divide them due to an intensified polarization of likes and dislikes. In this context it is possible to define three large groups of sports fanship: sports spectators, sports fans and hooligans (hoolifans).",

      "abstract": "Treating and assessing adolescents with substance abuse can present difficult ethical problems. Each of these areas alone can be difficult. Together, they are even more challenging. Confidentiality in regard to sharing information with parents and the law is an important consideration. If possible, it is usually best to respect confidentiality and privilege with adolescents. Sharing information with parents might depend on the seriousness of the substance problem as well as the therapeutic contract established at the outset of treatment. Ethics and the law are not the same. Although they usually are consistent, they can conflict. It is always ethical to follow the law, but sometimes it can be ethical not to do so. Ethical conflicts can arise when having dual conflicting loyalties and being a \"double agent\". These can be most marked in corrections settings, but can arise in school, college, or hospital settings. Informed consent is complex too. Adolescents generally have the cognitive ability to make important decisions but may lack the emotional maturity to do so. The law often deals with this by somewhat arbitrarily using specific ages to define capacity. It is usually best though to involve patents in complex decisions. Professional ethical guidelines are helpful, but they are the minimum in any ethical analysis and not the last word. They are merely how to stay out of trouble. The ethical practitioner will try to go beyond them in aspiring to the best ethical course of action. Resolving some of the ethical dilemmas is best seen as part of the challenge of practicing in this area. Experience and training in recognizing and resolving ethical dilemmas can be part of the appeal of practicing in this area.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents of Anglo‐Celtic, Greek, Italian and Chinese descent attending a wide range of post‐secondary institutions in Victoria (mean age = 18 years) were asked about their sexual behaviours, knowledge about AIDS, and social responses to the threat of AIDS. There was evidence of relatively high levels of sexual activity, with some members of all groups engaging in risky sexual behaviour. Anglo‐Australians were more sexually active and informed about AIDS, with more equality between the sexes in these respects than the other groups. There was a distinction made between behaviours regarded as safe with regular and casual partners, but the meaning attributed to regular partnership differed. Greek‐ and Italian‐Australian young men endorsed monogamy for their regular partners but not necessarily for themselves, and Anglo‐Australians accepted a relationship of shorter duration as regular. Greater knowledge was not related to safer sexual behaviour, but discussion about a regular partner's previous sexual history correlated with more risky sexual behaviour. Overall, risk levels were not high but the casual‐regular partner distinction, together with the greater use of relatively unrealistic strategies for dealing with AIDS in association with risky behaviour in the non‐Anglo groups, gives cause for concern.",

At the macrosocial level the subject of analysis of gender deprivation in education is gender perceptions as a reflection of the state gender policy in general and the educational level in particular has been revealed. At the level of intergroup interaction there are gender stereotypes, at the level of interpersonal relations there are gender guidelines, at the intraindividual level there is a gender identity. Gender relations of participants in the educational process are considered as real practices and models of intersex interaction, determined by gender perceptions, prejudices, stereotypes, social rules, which are reflected in the minds of subjects. Gender bias is analyzed as social rules with negative and distorted content, as a prejudised opinion towards the representatives of one or another sex, which reflects the common norms of gender-specific behavior. Three components in the structure of gender bias: cognitive which is unreasonably biased, irrational thoughts about men/women in general or about their ability to be successful in some areas or unsuccessful in others; affective which means rejection, humiliation, underestimation, negative feelings towards members of one or another sex; behavioral which is connected with destructive, negative behavior towards them have been distinguished. The need to study the gender deprivation in education from the standpoint of different psychological approaches in the context of a comprehensive analysis of deprivation conditions, deprivation factors, the consequences of being brought up or living temporarily in such conditions and ways of their resocialization and integration into society in the process of socio-psychological support has been emphasized. The importance of systematic monitoring and finding diagnostic indicators of gender deprivation in the education system in order to prevent the deprivation of subjects of the educational process and create a gender-sensitive educational environment has been established.",

      "title": "Introduction to applied social psychology",
      "abstract": "Social psychology is a basic science aimed at understanding human social behaviour and the motivations, cognitions and emotions related to such behaviour. For example, social psychologists try to understand why people so easily give into social pressure, why people often seem insensitive to the needs of others, why people become aggressive, why people like each other or why people are unhappy even though they seem to have everything going for them. Social psychology tries to build knowledge primarily through laboratory experiments, and therefore theories and findings from social psychology may sometimes seem remote from the actual problems in society. However, many, if not most, societal problems have social-psychological aspects, that is, they are rooted in behaviour or human cognitions. For example, integration problems may result from conflicts between groups and the inherent human tendency to favour one's own group, and traffic accidents are to a large extent caused by unsafe driving styles and the unrealistic perception that one is a better driver than most others. Moreover, health problems are related to unhealthy eating habits and a sense of not being able to control one's appetite, and environmental problems result in part from growing consumption levels and a tendency to pay attention only to one's immediate interests. Consequently, solutions and prevention of such problems require changes in attitudes, values, behaviour and lifestyles (Zimbardo, 2002). Social psychologists can play an important role in this respect.",

      "abstract": "It has become conventional to think of an adult's permissiveness toward a child as representing neutralization of adult control. By behaving permissively (acceptantly, nonjudgmentally, etc.), the adult is thought to be freeing the child from his presence and authority, and in some loose sense to be permitting the child to behave as he would in the absence of any adult. Such thinking has emphasized the punitive or threatening aspects of adultchild relations. Adult permissiveness is seen as a way of reducing the child's fear of adult punishment and thus as a way of encouraging him to express in behavior those impulses whose expression he knows to be normally unacceptable to adults. Such thinking about permissiveness has been the basis for explanations which have been advanced for a frequent finding about aggression in doll play. It has repeatedly been observed that aggression in doll play increases over time or from session to session (i, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9). This finding has typically been explained by reference to the adult experimenter's acceptant and nonjudgmental interaction with the child and the fear-reducing effect this interaction has. For example, in discussing recent evidence confirming the finding, Levin and Sears state that",

Evolving scientific knowledge of the era is at times used to justify and support mental illnesses. Too often, however, remasked nomenclatures fail to alter social stigma, in part because political arguments are used. Scientific validations of variant behaviors as symptoms with a pathologic status are unfortunately overshadowed. Examples of cultural bias effects on recurring diagnostic challenges illustrate a need for scientific validation. Renaming fails to improve stigma or diagnostic clarity. For example, neurasthenia, or nervous exhaustion, was attributed to fast-paced urban life through the late 1970s. Its symptoms are now largely, to no real advantage, retitled as chronic fatigue syndrome. Diagnoses like \"hysteria\" have evolved into histrionic personality disorder and somatoform spectrum disorders, although less as a result of demonic possession or a \"wandering uterus.\" Decriminalized and depathologized homosexuality remains a political football, where religious \"sin\" conceptualizations have not been displaced by studies documenting healthy adjustments among groups with diverse sexual orientations and preferences. Each of these remains severely socially stigmatized. The pseudoscience of \"drapetomania,\" once used to rationalize and pathologize a slave's freedom, is perceived now as psychiatric incarcerations of mentally healthy individuals, more commonly in totalitarian regimes-a politicization of stigma. Research reviews and funding efforts need to emphasize a sound basis for individuals caught in perpetuated diagnostic challenges, not remedied by simple shifts in nomenclature.",

Children were, to varying degrees, disembodied from their own bodies, literally as well as metaphorically, and also from their mothers' bodies, and their fathers'. Descartes had argued that the body is a machine, and a number of nineteenth-century physicians determined to put this theory into practice by advocating that children be raised with mechanical precision.

      "abstract": "The concept of adoption is not of common law origin, but a 'creature of statutory origin' in United States. Adoption is, therefore, a court procedure by which an adult becomes legal parent of someone who is not his or her biological child. Adoption creates a parent-child relationship recognized for all purposes-including support obligations, inheritance rights and custody. While in most cases adults adopt miners, it is possible in most states for one adult to adopt another. Regardless of type, adoptions can be granted only by a court and are allowed only when court declares adoption to be in best interests of child. To assist court in making this determination, state (or local) welfare department conducts on investigation into home maintained by prospective adopting parents. The court looks at: occupations, earnings and stability of prospective parents; medical, emotional and physical needs of child; religious and racial compatibility; whether prospective parents has any criminal record or history of abuse; age of child. In recent years, some people have challenged certain aspects of adoption process, calling for reform. Many of these people have conflicting concerns. Biological parents have challenged time limits when their consent for adoption becomes final. They want a longer period of time. For them, adoption should be viewed as a process of last resort. Conversely, adoptive parents wants shorter time limits in order to assure certainty and finality of adoption process. Adult adoptees, who were adopted as children, assert that adoption files that were closed when they were adopted and remain confidential should be open upon their request. They are in search of their biological identity. States are at various stages in responding to these reform demands. The Uniform Adoption Act, promulgated in 1994 by National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and also adopted by American Bar Association in 1995, attempts to respond to these conflicting concerns. The promoters of Act also seek to influence various states to adopt this Act and bring uniformity of adoption law among states.

The diversity of violence types, the education segments, the age segments who aggress and who are aggressed, get more and more extended. The social context is crucial for both the performance and understanding of violence. The term „senseless violence‟ is often heard in cases where a serious violent incident was apparently unprovoked or has emerged from “insignificant” insults or altercation. The notion of “senseless” violence is, by implication, contrasted to some other „reasonable‟ kind, or perhaps suggests that what we find repugnant needs to be placed beyond the bound of sense. Most people probably have a wordless conception of what is a reasonable response to offence or provocation, for example, a fatal shooting following an altercation over a parking place appears inexplicable and senseless. Still many acts of extreme violence occur in response to apparently minor incidents and violence nearly always has “sense”, that is, social meaning, to both perpetrators and victims. The targets of violence are rarely chosen randomly and the victims and perpetrators are frequently already known to each other. In some cases the attribution “senseless” refers to an assumed mental illness or other pathology that might account for otherwise incomprehensible behavior. Human society registered besides direct violence: war, murder, rape, assault, verbal attacks, that is the kind that we physically perceive, another two invisible forms and can‟t be eliminated without eliminating them, cultural violence and structural violence. Direct violence has its roots in cultural and structural violence; then it feeds back and strengthens them. All three forms interact as a triad. Direct violence reinforces structural and cultural violence. We are trapped in a vicious cycle that is now threatening to destroy life on earth.",

      "abstract": "From early in life, human infants appear capable of taking others' perspectives, and can do so even when the other's perspective conflicts with the infant's perspective. Infants' success in perspective-taking contexts implies that they are managing conflicting perspectives despite a wealth of data suggesting that doing so relies on sufficiently mature Executive Functions, and is a challenge even for adults. In a new theory, I propose that infants can take other's perspectives because they have an altercentric bias. This bias results from a combination of the value that human cognition places on others' attention, and an absence of a competing self-perspective, which would, in older children, create a conflict requiring resolution by Executive Functions. A self-perspective emerges with the development of cognitive self-awareness, sometime in the second year of life, at which point it leads to competition between perspectives. This theory provides a way of explaining infants' ability to take others' perspectives, but raises the possibility that they could do so without representing or understanding the implications of perspective for others' mental states.

Hate, mistrust, and intolerance are often propagated via hate speech. It may also be used to harm or frighten others. People may feel alienated, anxious, and exposed as a result. Hate crimes may also result from it. Furthermore, hate speech may undermine intergroup trust. It is crucial to identify hate speech since doing so may assist to stop these negative impacts. Social media has recently developed into a haven for hate speech. Social media hate speech may be detrimental to society. Free speech, racial slur, and laws not for it have all been striving issues. Any speech, behaviour, writing, or display that encourages violence or other unpleasant deeds against a cohort of people or an organisation based on that person's subscription in the group, or that defames or affects that person or personal based on that membership, is considered racial slur under the laws of most countries. The laws may designate a category based on particular identities. Many countries do not consider racial slur to be a legal word. Additionally, the constitution permits the majority of what is seen as \"hate speech\" in many countries, including the US. In different countries, a sufferer of racial slurs may seek justice through civil lawsuit, convict lawsuit, or both. As communications are delivered and received virtually instantly, social media networks (SMNs) are the quickest form of communication. The emergence of social media platforms has irreparably altered how people interact in our society, and one result of these changes is an increase in unacceptable behaviours like the use of nasty and angry language online. It might be challenging to express harsh or disrespectful ideas to someone right in the face. People believe it is safe to abuse people or publish harmful content online. Hate speech may be harmful to an individual or a community. For improper material on the Web to be changed or blocked, it must be detected. Massive amounts of text data need human processing and classification, which takes time and effort. But since there is so much data released each day, automated approaches are crucial for recognising this kind of material.",

La mayoria de los adolescentes llegan a ser sexualmente activos sin haber accedido a los servicios de planificacion familiar por lo que la prevencion de los embarazos no deseados se plantea como un objetivo prioritario. En general, los adolescentes pueden utilizar cualquier metodo contraceptivo ya que la edad no constituye una contraindicacion y las ventajas de evitar un embarazo suelen superar los riesgos teoricos o probados. Cuando exista el riesgo de contraer infecciones de transmision sexual, se recomendara la doble proteccion. Mediante una actitud abierta y dialogante y una atencion confidencial, los profesionales de la salud pueden ayudar a los adolescentes a reconocer sus necesidades contraceptivas y a tomar decisiones responsables relacionadas con su comportamiento sexual.",

      "title": "Human trafficking as a form of organized crime: Main phenomenological features",
      "abstract": "Human trafficking is a complex socio-pathological phenomenon based on (historical) institutions of slavery and exploitation, i.e. on treating a man as goods or a thing, in order to exploit his labor power, knowledge and skills, bodily and sexual integrity in order to satisfy one's own or someone else's instinct, health or emotional needs or in order to gain direct or indirect material profit for oneself or somebody else. Certain forms of slavery and exploitation of persons known from ancient times can be seen today in identical form (public selling of victims, working exploitation in agricultural and home sector, sexual exploitation, forced participation in armed conflicts) or in modified forms (working exploitation in industrial sector, illegal adoption), and there are completely new forms (trafficking in bodily organs or parts, performing medical experiments, forced pregnancy, and similar). On the other hand, manifesting forms of trafficking do not differ in practice from some other similar phenomena primarily smuggling of migrants, prostitution and work of illegal migrants in so-called black economy sector. This is why it has been pointed to the main features of this phenomenon. The conclusion is that trafficking is a multi-manifesting phenomenon, and this is why it is very difficult to come to a comprehensive, generally accepted classification of its manifesting forms. The offered classification of forms of trafficking according to the degree of social danger, geographical level of implementation, physical and biological characteristics of victims and relation of victim to his/her position, in principle, does not exclude the possibility of some other classification. The cases of trafficking in practice can almost always be identified as some of possible combination of previously mentioned forms and types. In addition to being a multi-manifesting, trafficking is also a multi-structural phenomenon. The process of its realization, in principle, consists of four stages with many sub-stages within each of them. The dominant moments in realization of trafficking are certainly recruiting of victims, their transport, exploitation and elimination. Finally, trafficking is exceptionally developed and represented activity of organized criminal groups, more and more oft en transnational in scope. Excessive demand for sexual services increased the excessive demand for the victims of trafficking, but also the division of jobs among criminal organizations, their specialization and tendency to create monopole position at human market, which is more and more characterized by marketing, work of agencies, rules of business operations and other epithets of modern economic management. There are huge possibilities of profit since the victims can be exploited in many various ways. The knowledge of the main characteristics of certain forms of trafficking is an important condition to identify these complex and dynamic phenomena in practice, then to distinguish the trafficking from other similar security problems as well as to identify active and passive subjects in trafficking.",

      "title": "The Role of Social Approach and Avoidance Motives for Subjective Well‐Being and the Successful Transition to Adulthood",
      "abstract": "Social affiliation appears to be a central human need. Taking a developmental perspective, we discuss whether and how the desire to belong (approach motivation) and the fear of being rejected (avoidance motivation) might be of central importance for understanding success or failure in transitional phases, especially in the transition from adolescence into adulthood. Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral consequences of social motives (approach, avoidance, and their co‐occurrence) are reviewed. We argue that both tendencies need to be taken into account for understanding affiliation motivation and behavior and its significance for life satisfaction and well‐being. A predominant social approach motivation has positive consequences for cognition, behavior, emotion, and well‐being, whereas the opposite pattern holds for a predominant avoidance motivation. Co‐occurrence of both is characterised by ambivalent cognitions and emotions, and unstable behavior. Taking a developmental perspective, however, and considering social development in the transition to adulthood, co‐occurrence might be more beneficial than a predominant avoidance motivation. Il est clair que l’affiliation est un besoin humain fondamental. On se demande, dans une perspective développementale, si et comment le désir d’être accueilli (motivation à l’approche) et la crainte d’être rejeté (motivation à l’évitement) pourraient être d’une importance majeure dans l’explication du succès ou de l’échec des périodes de transition, en particulier lors du passage de l’adolescence à l’âge adulte. On passe en revue les prolongements cognitifs, émotionnels et comportementaux des motivations sociales (approche, évitement et leurs corollaires). On soutient que les deux tendances doivent être prises en compte pour comprendre la motivation à l’affiliation et les comportements qui s’ensuivent, ainsi que leur portée pour le bien‐être et le bonheur de vivre. Etre prioritairement motivé par les contacts sociaux a des retombées positives sur la cognition, le comportement, les émotions et le bien‐être, tandis que le schéma inverse renvoie à une motivation dominante pour l’évitement. La co‐occurrence de ces deux motivations provoque des cognitions et des émotions ambivalentes et un comportement instable. Toutefois, d’un point de vue développemental, et pour ce qui est de la maturation sociale lors du passage vers l’âge adulte, la co‐occurrence pourrait se révéler plus bénéfique que la seule motivation à l’évitement.",

      "title": "Fear and Loathing in Animus: Moral Panic, the Contextualizing Tool for Challenging Gender-affirming Care Bans",
      "abstract": "Recent legislative attempts to restrict or prohibit gender-affirming care for non-binary and transgender individuals are part of a broader trend by some states to undermine LGBTQ rights. Advocacy groups are actively challenging the constitutionality of these measures. This article argues that these groups should apply the sociological theory of moral panic to argue that the legislation is unconstitutional because the laws are based on and foster fear and irrationality. Moral panic is a social phenomenon that involves an exaggerated reaction to a perceived threat, often of an already marginalized group, that the rest of society or community views as a danger to a social value, norm, or morality. Laws drafted to capitalize on the fear of constituents or in reaction to the disproportional fear do not address the root issues of these panics but rather target marginalized groups that exercise existing stigma. The constitutional doctrine of animus has long been a useful, though recently underused, tool to strike down laws that, whether intentionally or not, discriminatorily impact a particular group due to fear, dislike, or disgust. While animus is not a central argument that advocates are making in the current litigation challenging gender-affirming care bans, advocates should use moral panic to highlight the foundation role fear and loathing play in the legislation's discriminatory intent to harm transgender individuals.",

We use the example of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder to show that, for people with cognitive differences, it is necessary to seek legal protection from discrimination within a disability framework. This approach can be problematic because of the stigma that attaches to disability and because of the way that provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth) are interpreted. An alternative approach is to treat cognitive and behavioural attributes within a framework that recognises different abilities, rather than starting from a presumptive position of disability, in much the same way that gender or religious beliefs are treated.]",

By being single, what have these women gained and what have they missed? How do they deal with sexuality? In the nineteenth century women were thought to have greater moral purity than men, and spinsters were supposed to exist in a realm above or beyond sexuality. After the sexualisation of women, single women seemed to have no legitimate relationship to sexuality. Celibacy came to be seen as abnormal and deviant, but sexuality was to be expressed in the context of marriage. With growing permissiveness and tolerance in social and moral attitudes the opportunities for single women to define their sexuality increased. But stereotypical views of single women as a sexual threat have not disappeared; women still walk the tightrope strung between a continuum of representations from madonnas to whores. A sexually active woman, who does not express her sexuality in the context of romantic attachments institutionalised in cornpanionate marriage, is still judged and feared.",

Yet, we have little hesitation in describing the two main topics of this volume—(1) self and social identity and (2) social and behavioral aspects of physical health and illness-as research areas whose current high levels of activity and productivity are likely to remain constant, if not intensify, in the foreseeable future. Over the past few decades, each of these topics has become a firmly established focus of investigation.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays young people during the phase of their puberty and adolescence often show symptoms of a grave crisis of identity which particularly idspose them to drug-abuse. On the one hand this search for one's identity is characteristic of the formative years of a juvenile; on the other hand it is a general problem of the generations which must be seen in the full context of the social, technological, industrial and political development of our time. Lacking possibilities of identification in the context of a general relativism of traditional norms and values, radical changes in the structures of the family and of our society, accompained by over-exaggerated demands on one's personal performance and prosperity, and significant failures of communication as well as the unreflected liberalization of a \"permissive society\" make young people look for new possibilities of identification which they try to find in sub-cultural groups and fascinating experiences which drugs. Many juvenile drugconsumers show increasing crises in their personalites and farreaching psychological distrubances often followed by a serious development. All these phenomena illustrate the frustrated search for genuine personal identity in an illusionary world of drugs. Only the solidaric and constructive cooperation of the generations can overcome the manifold problems and conflicts of young people which are concentrated in their identitycrises, and only this cooperation can open up new perspectives for a future which is humane and worth living, a future which is the real aim of the subcultural movements and psychodelic experiences.",

Most, however, pass quickly through this phase and although, like most adults, they may continue to swear they do so mainly to relieve feelings of tension and frustration and only then in situations where such language is uncensured and inoffensive to those present. There is, indeed, a developmental pattern to the swear words that children use. Between the ages of around four to seven years children tend to use words associated with excrement (even indirectly in some cases; e.g., knickers). Often the delight in using them stems not only from the knowledge that they are forbidden, but also from a fairly precise knowledge of their meaning. The next stage is the use of sexual obscenities and the delight in using these stems from their reference to forbidden things or their power to affect or provoke adults, rather than from an awareness of their precise meaning. Finally, older children may use blasphemies widely and openly; e.g. Jesus Christ! There is much disagreement among adults as regards the use and nature of such blasphemies and a whole area of uncertainty surrounds them. When using these words older children are often testing out their positions vis-à-vis adults within an area of perceived controversy, but it frequently represents a growing awareness of what is or is not acceptable.",

      "abstract": "Alcoholism is a disease that attacks regardless of age, religion, nationality, sex, level of education, mental health, family situation, socio-economic status or character. Research on students' attitudes towards alcohol was carried out in Poland and Ukraine, in the countries where there is widespread positive feedback on its effects. In wide social circles put to the survey, alcohol consumption is a tradition taking place during different celebrations or almost every meeting. In addition, the use of alcohol means a quick drink up of large quantities of strong alcoholic drinks. This way of drinking does not function as a symbol of the meeting or its background, but becomes the center and the main reason. Alcohol used by teens generally does not cause surprise or concern. Many communities treat alcohol drunk in childhood, as natural and inevitable. It sometimes happens that young people and even children receive the first can of beer or a glass of champagne from the hands of their own parents. Until recently, public awareness of the phenomenon of using psychoactive substances has related to the margin of society, people from the so-called pathological and criminal environments. A little later there were reports that the alcohol and other drugs are in the range of interests of adolescents, coming from \"good homes\" and having good future prospects. The aim of the study was to investigate the attitudes of Polish and Ukrainian students towards alcohol. The main problem of the research focused on the question: Is there a difference in the attitudes of young people towards alcohol because of the country of origin? Research shows that among the students there is a problem of alcohol abuse. We must therefore start to implement effectively, not just \"on paper\", alcohol prevention programs already in primary schools.",

Infidelity is a phenomenon that existed since instituted marriage. In fact, although the phenomenon of infidelity is not new, some people are saying that they would never have guessed at all that their partners do so. Infidelity can occur in all circles, including to the police, where a police officer every day to face and must relate to the community. This research is a qualitative description of the type of research that attempted to link psychological phenomena with other aspects that are considered important.\r\nThe results obtained show that the phenomenon of husband's infidelity that occurs because of the need for a friend who can be invited to communicate, physical keterpikatan that occur between husbands and their mistresses, the influence of the existing environment so as to make the husband having an affair, and certainly the perceived sexual satisfaction husband when dealing with the affair. It must be realized that in order to dare to separate himself from the cheating partner is difficult, it takes energy, thoughts, sacrifice, and incredible time. This involves the liver needs, tastes, and biological. The occurrence of cheating actually started because of the situation himself the husband who was in dire need of attention and affection touches to create different nuances of everyday life is her husband. Based on the results of this study can be concluded that generally the husband who cheated on the need to release tension caused by biological, they need a friend to talk, they need someone who can be invited to communicate and so forth. Every couple should better understand the meaning of marriage as something sacred. Communicative open communication between couples is essential.

These struggles translate into lower marital satisfaction perceived by both intimate partners. However, this connection is bidirectional, since conflicts with a romantic partner are the most common precipitating factors of decompensation in BPD patients.This narrative review was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases with keywords \"borderline personality disorder\", \"partnership\", marital problems\", and \"marital conflicts\". Articles, books, and book chapters published within January 1980 - December 2020 were extracted and analysed. Additional sources were found while reviewing references of relevant articles. The total of 131 papers met the inclusion criteria.Patients with BPD struggle with reaching marital satisfaction. They often find themselves in disharmonic and unfulfilling relationships. The association between the relationship issues and BPD may partly come from misunderstanding one or both partners' behaviour. Individuals with BPD tend to misinterpret their partner's behaviour, struggle with communication, and sometimes be verbally and physically aggressive. They often do not recognize that their intrapersonal processes influence their interpersonal struggles. Understanding the role of the maladaptive personality traits in the relationship and their management could be beneficial for both partners.Individuals with BPD often report dysfunctional romantic relationships characterized by insecure attachment, maladaptive communication, and lower relationship satisfaction.

From the Iranian medicine point of view, because of different mental and physical differences in human, their sexual power and need for sex is different. It is necessary to observe the normal range, since the sexual indulgence causes different illnesses. Evidence Acquisitions: In Iranian medicine, different variables such as time, location, mental and physical situation, and also various forms of sex are discussed in sexual health. Safe sex not just reduces many mental disorders, but also prevents many neurological, digestive, urinary and genital disorders. Also, sexual indulgence is most harmful for health and causes stiffness, weakness and different diseases; therefore observing moderation in sex, according to the therapeutic characteristics and power, has been emphasized. Results: To have safe sex, it is necessary to consider time, mental, and physical status. Having sex when the stomach is full impairs digestion. Sexual relationship after heavy sports and severe emotional reactions such as anger or sadness, and after diarrhea or blood sampling is harmful. It has been recommended that having sex in temperate weather, and after evacuation of urine and feces, considering necessary arrangements, make the couple reach orgasm. Also, in the Iranian traditional medicine references, specific nutritional and health recommendations have been proposed for the sexually active people. Conclusions: Health care recommendations of Iranian physicians involve precious and new points for the updated scientific communities. Scientific revision of these recommendations can be promising for public health improvement.",

      "abstract": "A matched sample of fifty cohabiting and fifty married couples revealed that cohabiting individuals were less church oriented, more anti-establish ment, and pessimistic than married individuals. The cohabitors felt repressed by authority and used marijuana, LSD, and speed with greater frequency than marrieds. They entered an ephemeral relationship with more previous sexual experiences of poor quality and were less committed to the relationship, although they were as faithful as married individuals while in the relationship. Cohabitors tended to be more dissatisfied with life, nonconforming, rebellious, fearful of close ties, withdraum, and more likely to experience internal conflicts and bizarre thoughts or behavior. They evidenced greater restlessness, impulsiveness, and scattered interests and energies. Their interpersonal relationships tended in the direction of superficiality, and attitudes of self-criticism seemed prevalent. Cohabiting males were more demanding, sensitive, idealistically and aesthetically inclined, blaming and touchy. Cohabiting females were more likely to be shy and retiring in unfamiliar situations than married females. In general, coha bitors tended to be more discouraged and less well-adjusted than marrieds.",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse and assault can be characterized by an individual committing a sexual act against other individuals who are too young to consent. Sexual acts could range from verbal sexual harassment, to sexual organs being fondled, to penetration (oral or genital), and other sexual acts. Perpetrators stem from heterogeneous populations and can be related to their victims, known by their victims or, more rarely, strangers to their victims. Victims of sexual abuse can suffer short-term and long term adverse consequences on different levels. In many, mostly western, societies the occurrence of child sexual abuse is regarded as a traumatic experience for the victims on an individual level and as a problem of the corresponding society on a macro-societal level. One (Western) response to the problem has been the development of group-based empowerment prevention programmes which are seen as cost cutting and cost-effective. Still, many critiques view the empowerment model is ineffective and dangerous for children at the same time. Some critiques are outlined here and suggestions are made for further preventive directions in child protection.",

      "abstract": "The term 'Honour Killing' is conventionally used to denote a specific category of extralegal killings where the act of murder is seen to have been motivated by pre-modern affiliations/sentiments of some sort. Acts of violence committed against people for marrying outside of caste/religion/ethnicity or other similar infringements where they are seen by their actions to have besmirched the honour of the family and the larger community come under the broad rubric of honour crime. Implicit in using the term are assumptions that mark it as different from other crimes. Honour is defined in terms of women assigned sexual and familial roles as dictated by traditional family ideology. Thus, adultery, premarital relationships (which may or may not include sexual relations), rape, and falling in love with an \"inappropriate\" person may constitute violations of family honour. 'Crimes of honour' as a form of violence against women does not imply that men also are not subjected to such crimes. In cases of forced marriage or interference with the right of choice and whom to marry, pressure from older family members over younger members will apply to men as well as to women. However, women remain the victims and survivors of 'crimes of honour' and have fewer available remedies.",

The person who has a transformative self can too easily strive for growth in ways that are paradoxically counter to eudaimonic growth and that are harmful to the self and others. This chapter explores the dark side of the transformative self in four forms. First, perfectionism in its maladaptive forms involves impossible or otherwise unchecked ideals for perfection. Second, eudaimonic materialism values moral virtue and wisdom but veers toward moralism and intellectual self-adulation. Third, “wanting it all” aims for a well-rounded life but can manifest as a problem of overcommitment, for which cultural master narratives of success place women at particular risk. Fourth, in contrast, a never-ending search for meaning, or “ceaseless seeking,” involves an unrelenting pursuit of an idealistically true self or meaning in life and can manifest as a problem of undercommitment.",

However, it is posited that parricide can be considered a form of elder abuse in Russia, as the line between elder abuse and parricide can be vague. Instances of parricide can appear trivial, hardly realized as such by victims and the social environment. Borderline cases can include involving older people in binge drinking, denying them help, and manipulating them to commit suicide. The perpetrators are often nonpsychotic, although sometimes exhibiting abnormal personality traits. Anger toward the victim can be absent on the part of the perpetrator, with their actions often driven by economic desires. A concluding point is that for better prevention of parricide and, therefore, elder abuse, it should not be considered only an unusual horrific crime committed by the mentally ill.",

The challenge of physical development, especially the demands of mature sexuality and the push to become free of dependence on parents during adolescence, places the individual in a critical situation, when he can either move forward or cling to infantile modes of functioning. We do not fully understand the smooth transition from adolescence to adulthood, but our work with disturbed individuals helps us to recognize some of the factors that interfere with this process. Before giving examples of disturbed individuals, I would like to spell out some of the special features of adolescent development.",

When dealing with HIV/AIDS and older adults, it is essential that all parties involved address the many preconceived ideas and myths that present obstacles to education, diagnosis, and treatment. The first is that seniors are not at risk for HIV/AIDS because they do not have sex, the second is that persons to whom they are providing services could not possibly have a current or past history of substance abuse, and the third is that persons are most likely heterosexual. In addition to failing to recognize that older people are indeed at risk, another factor that prevents timely diagnosis of HIV/AIDS in the older population is the supposition that the symptoms experienced by the aging patient are related to diseases common to elderly persons. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS status produces a wide range of emotional responses.",

      "title": "VIOLENCIA: UNA REVISIÓN DEL TEMA DENTRO DEL MARCO DE TRABAJO DE INVESTIGACIÓN EN EL INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE PSIQUIATRÍA*",
      "abstract": "Hasta hace relativamente poco no se le daba importancia plena a las diversas manifestaciones de la violencia, pero en la actualidad cada vez son mas los trabajos de investigacion que se realizan para conocer este problema en sus diversas areas. La violencia es un fenomeno extenso que se manifiesta tanto en el ambito interpersonal e individual como social. En consecuencia, como concepto es igualmente amplio, multisemantico, ya que senala distintos atributos que hacen enfasis segun el campo especifico del que se habla. El fenomeno esta imbricado lo mismo en la guerra que en el crimen organizado y la delincuencia comun. En ocasiones se da en las instituciones del Estado, pero tambien se manifiesta en la familia, ya sea entre los conyuges o la pareja, hacia los hijos o cualquier otro integrante de esta. Existe violencia con implicaciones particulares como la violencia sexual hacia los ninos, el incesto y la violacion, asi como violencia autoinfligida, como el suicidio. Para los profesionales de la salud mental, cada forma en que se manifiesta la violencia tiene implicaciones particulares en terminos de los efectos, ya sean en la salud fisica, la salud mental o en los aspectos psicosociales. En este sentido es importante obtener conocimiento sobre el tema, ya que muchas de estas areas no han recibido la atencion que merecen. Dado lo anterior, el interes del presente trabajo ha sido organizar y sintetizar la informacion de las diversas investigaciones llevadas a cabo en el Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria sobre el tema de violencia, con el fin de ofrecer una panoramica que nos permita ubicar las principales areas y como se han trabajado, asi como discutir hacia donde seria conveniente continuar los esfuerzos. Durante la vida academica de nuestra institucion de salud se han llevado a cabo diversos proyectos de investigacion vinculados con la problematica de la violencia. Por un lado, estan los trabajos que asocian el consumo de alcohol y violencias como los accidentes de transito, los delitos, los ingresos a salas de urgencia y la violencia en la familia, entre otros. Por otro, se encuentran los trabajos que asocian el consumo de drogas con alguna forma de violencia, particularmente las muertes violentas como los accidentes, la violencia delictiva y la familiar. El mayor numero de trabajos se concentra en el area de la salud mental, ya que esta incluye una amplia variedad de temas como la conducta suicida -que incluye ideacion, intento y suicidio consumado-, ademas de trastornos asociados, intimamente ligados con hechos de violencia, como el estres postraumatico. Asimismo se han abordado gran variedad de aspectos psicologicos y psicosociales, como la violencia de genero. A pesar de lo anterior, aun hace falta mayor investigacion en areas especificas como los efectos del secuestro, la tortura y el abuso sexual, asi como investigacion centrada en los perpetradores. El resultado de la investigacion es fundamental ya que, previo a la intervencion, es necesario conocer las diversas implicaciones en la salud mental; por ejemplo, que trastornos se asocian y por que a las distintas violencias, y que otras consecuencias pueden surgir. Precisamente, todo el conocimiento generado es de gran ayuda para una intervencion oportuna en las victimas. Pero tambien se puede incidir en un ambito mas amplio; por ejemplo, utilizando la informacion obtenida para influir en las instituciones, tanto legales como educativas, asi como considerar la posible influencia de los medios masivos de comunicacion. Esto podria tener una repercusion positiva en el nivel social, ya que el fenomeno de la violencia comprende por igual a las victimas y a los perpetradores. Ambos grupos han recibido una influencia cultural y social que hay que conocer para hacer lo posible por contrarrestarla.",

College Students; Higher Education; Racial Factors; *Role; *Role Perception; Role Theory; Sex Stereotypes; Social Cognition; *Stereotypes The purpose of this study was to test hypotheses drawn from the social role model about the process that people use in deciding what other people are like, focusing on the difference that other people's age, race, and sex make. A sample of non-Latino White students (671) ranging in age from 18 to 81 years used the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI) to rate a person in one of 12 target groups (a race-unspecified or African-American woman or man in their late 20s, late 40s or late 60s). Race-unspecified targets were almost always seen as non-Latiro Whites. Old persons and women were seen as significantly more communal and less agentic in personality than younger adults and men, respectively. When students' estimates of the likelihood that the target they were rating was retired was controlled, the main effect for age of target in communal traits disappeared. This finding supports the interpretation that age stereotypes partly stem from perceivers' observations of people's social roles.

Primary aging, a genetically determined series of biologic alterations, is usually observed as declines in physiologic efficiency. The human organism consists of three biologic components, two cellular and one noncellular. Consequently, there is not one uniform explanation for all of the various aging processes. Unfortunately, the so-called primary aging processes are not completely independent of the environment, thus making it difficult to distinguish them from disease and trauma. Changes within the nervous system are of particular importance. The observable changes, such as in the electroencephalogram with the focal abnormalities predominantly in the left temporal lobe, appear to be an interaction of several important variables. In many individuals mild to moderate hypertension appears to be a protective mechanism rather than a pathological one. Stress for the older person arises not only from excessive conflicts and stimuli but also from partial isolation and deprivation. From a socioeconomic viewpoint the elderly American can be identified as belonging to a deprived minority group.",

In this chapter, we examine respect as a case study of such behavioral codes or norms. By respect, we mean that people are impelled to treat each other as individuals of goodwill and competence, even if they do not privately believe it. This norm explains why people, including strangers, trust each other much more than the underlying rational economic analysis would suggest. It also explains a host of other interpersonal behaviors, such as helping and avoiding confrontation. The anatomy of respect is complex. It works often against a person's underlying preferences rather than for them, constitutes what people think they should do rather than what they want to do, is driven by anxiety, focuses on regulating actions rather than their outcomes, comprises avoidance motivation rather than approach motivation, and is more moral (ie, private and personal) than social (ie, honored only because it is actively enforced by others) in nature. Despite the range and power of its influence, the norm of respect itself receives too little respect, in that people commonly underestimate its impact on human behavior.",

It is asserted that the character faults are present even before the appearance of the seizures. Increasing slowness and diminished capacity for any kind ofactivity is said to occur long before the epileptic disorder manifests itself. In recent years, Clark 1 has formulated the conception that epilepsy should be looked on as a psychobiologic disorder, and he regards it as an outflow from the homosexual component which is not sublimated or accepted. According to this point of view, the epileptic make-up is deep-rooted in narcissism, which results from poorly repressed homosexuality. The extroverted sexual life of epileptic persons is said to cease somewhere between 25 and 30 years of age, and the whole libido is then focused",

Abarca una enorme amplitud de situaciones y alternativas sociales y morales para un menor indefenso, que fue o puede ser victima de la impulsividad sexual y perversa de un eventual y aun esporadico abusador. La primera senal que acusa su gravedad es la falta de igualdad y la no equiparabilidad y desequilibrio entre recursos y vias de prevencion y defensa entre la victima del abuso sexual infantil, el menor abusado, y su abusador, aunque este podria ser otro menor y no solo un adulto. En el menor abusado recae todo el peso y el dano de esta disparidad y desequilibrio que quedan caracterizados y patentados por su inocencia e incapacidad e inmadurez etaria para salvar o eludir el caracter inherente y esencialmente vejatorio y abusivo del ASI. En el trabajo se exponen sus circunstancias mas comunes e inmediatas, susriesgos y mas temibles consecuencias, las distintas figuras de la victima y delvictimario, los estudios que se siguen para su prevencion y deteccion temprana,como las condiciones previas y las consecuencias inmediatas tanto sociales comolegales e institucionales que van formando sus variadas alternativas. Se dan datos y resultados relevantes referentes al mes del ano en que la casuistica se eleva significativamente (febrero, como mes habitual de vacaciones de verano en el hemisferio sud) y, asimismo, el abandono o interrupcion de sus estudios primarios y secundarios por parte del menor y por causas que pueden ser propias o ambientales.",

      "abstract": "The social structure of illiteracy is relatively simple to chart and not hard to understand. Limited educational opportunity in a hierarchically organized society, together with the scant need for literacy in many occupations, may explain why the response to the promotion of literacy was so thin and socially selective. More troublesome, however, are variations in illiteracy over time. There appears to have been no steady, cumulative progress in the reduction of illiteracy among men in the early modern period. Nor did the different social groups maintain the same level of illiteracy in relation to each other at all times from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. Rather, the record reveals an irregular fluctuation, a series of spurts and setbacks, plateaux, arrests and accelerations in the progress of literacy, which sometimes involved large sectors of society but at other times were confined to particular sets or specific social groups.",

Anxiety is a pervasive factor. Total understanding of the aging person within the context of his cultural climate, as well as the test situation itself, is essential for accurate judgments of projective and objective tests in this age group. A more meaningful evaluation is obtained if allowance is made for the intricate pattern of psycho-social factors affecting test performance, and if various alternative interpretations are entertained.",

      "abstract": "Cultures play a major role in shaping people’s behaviours and attitudes. They also shape individuals’ social and cognitive development, and the idioms of distress they use and the pathways into care they take. In addition, cultures shape the causation, precipitation, and perpetuation of psychiatric symptoms which may not always fit neatly into diagnostic categories. Cultures define what is normal and what is abnormal or deviant. This, in turn, will influence how diseases are recognized and what early intervention strategies are put into place. For psychoses, the untreated duration of mental illness can last for years depending upon the resources available and the models of illness. The preclinical state is often a non-state and offers a critical threshold, and, according to resources, cultures will often dictate, in subtle ways, what the threshold is in order to develop psychiatric services. In many cultures—depending upon the available services and the personality of individuals, as well as the level of family support—a risk assessment may well contribute to stress and may also affect the likelihood of getting health or other insurance. It may also lead to personal difficulties, such as marriage problems. Clinicians need to remember that cultural differences in communication between doctors and patients may well contribute to tensions and poor therapeutic engagement if the patients’ or their carers’ views and explanatory models are not taken into account.",

Some disability rights activists and philosophers, however, assert that disability has little or no impact on how well a person’s life goes, that it is neutral with respect to flourishing. In recent articles Stephen Campbell and Joseph Stramondo, while rejecting both views, claim that we cannot make any broad generalizations about the effect of disability on well-being. Whether they are right about physical and sensory disabilities, I do not know, but I argue that they are wrong about intellectual disabilities (ID). A broad generalization about intellectual disabilities is justified: it always has a negative impact on quality of life, even though there is no single negative impact. The disadvantages of ID are plain (all ID is bad) but complicated (its badness depends on multidimensional influences including biological condition, social environment and personal temperament).",

Ada beberapa tahapan pada masa remaja, salah satunya adalah remaja akhir. Pada tahap remaja akhir terdapat banyak perubahan yang akan muncul sebagai bentuk pengembangan diri, diantaranya mengenal lawan jenis, jatuh cinta, dan mulai berkembangnya alat reproduksi. Salah satu faktor terjadinya pernikahan dini di Bangka Belitung disebabkan oleh seks pranikah. Teknik pengumpulan data pada artikel ini menggunakan studi kepustakaan. Dengan menggunakan perspektif psikodinamika dan teori psikoseksual yaitu adanya dorongan dan kebutuhan seksual yang harus terpenuhi, serta pengaruh emosional yang menjadi faktor utama seseorang melakukan dan menyalurkan aktivitas seksualnya. Hal ini berkaitan dengan hasil penelitian yang mengungkapkan bahwa perilaku seks bebas tidak hanya disebabkan oleh faktor lingkungan tetapi juga didorong oleh diri sendiri. Selain itu, individu yang melakukan hubungan seks pranikah cenderung mengalami kerentanan dan mengganggu fungsi sosial. Adolescence is a very vulnerable period. At the adolescent stage, individual personalities and characters begin to form. There are several stages in adolescence, one of which is late adolescence. At the late adolescence stagemany changes will appear as a form of self-development, including knowing the opposite sex, falling in love, and starting to develop reproductive organs. One of the factors in the occurrence of early marriage in Bangka Belitung is premarital sex. The data collection technique in this article uses a literature study. By using a psychodynamic perspective and psychosexual theory, namely the existence of sexual urges and needs that must be met, as well as emotional influences which are the main factors for a person to carry out and channel sexual activity. This is related to the results of research which reveals that free sex behavior is not only caused by environmental factors but is also driven by oneself. In addition, individuals who have premarital sex tend to experience vulnerability and interfere with social functioning.",

Also in academic research greed is often defined as a self-interested desire for gain at the expense of others. In current ongoing research we demonstrate that dispositional greed is driven by resource insecurity. When resource access is insecure, this leads to both acquisitive behavior and positive effects for others in certain circumstances. Furthermore we show that when resource access is secure, there is no behavioral difference between greedy and non-greedy people.",

Several \"developmental lines\" of anxiety are described in some detail: strangeness and stranger anxiety, anxiety by contagion, separation anxiety, and anxiety through loss of love or security. Stranger anxiety can occur whether or not mother is present, whereas separation anxiety occurs in the absence of mother whether or not anyone else is present. Harry Stack Sullivan describes learning by the \"anxiety gradient\" as learning to discriminate increasing from diminishing anxiety, with alteration of activity in the direction of the latter. The self-system is an antianxiety system - not the whole self - which functions as a compass to steer the infant away from experiences of increasing anxiety and toward maximum euphoria. The dynamism of the self-system is purely a product of interpersonal experience arising from the general pursuit of satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Trust is essential for a secure and flourishing social life, but many economic and philosophical approaches argue that rational people should never extend it, in particular to strangers they will never encounter again. Emerging data on the trust game, a laboratory economic exchange, suggests that people trust strangers excessively (i.e., far more than their tolerance for risk and cynical views of their peers should allow). What produces this puzzling \"excess\" of trust? We argue that people trust due to a norm mandating that they show respect for the other person's character, presuming the other person has sufficient integrity and goodwill even if they do not believe it privately. Six studies provided converging evidence that decisions to trust follow the logic of norms. Trusting others is what people think they should do, and the emotions associated with fulfilling a social duty or responsibility (e.g., guilt, anxiety) account for at least a significant proportion of the excessive trust observed. Regarding the specific norm in play, trust rates collapse when respect for the other person's character is eliminated as an issue.",

Meanwhile, the term “sexuality” has come to connote a wide variety of human sociobiological responses that range from varying levels of social attraction or physiological arousal to intimate body contact that may or may not include physical penetration. The failure of research scientists to define what they mean by “sexuality,” “sexual behavior,” or “late life” when designing studies or publishing their results complicates attempts to compare research findings within older age groups and across societies and sociocultural environments. Still, at least five themes emerge as constant premises in the literature concerning sexual desire and activity in later life as defined by some form of mental and/or physical sexual response at age 50 or older.",

In both conditions, we allow the group size to vary. We find that children aged 9 and higher are better able to resist selfish impulses in public environments. Younger children, however, display no such effect. Further, we find self-control substantially impacted by group size. When decisions are public, larger groups lead to better self-control, while in the private condition the opposite holds. Our findings suggest that announcing decisions publicly and to large groups may be part of a solution to some social dilemmas. In addition, the fact that public decision-making promotes pro-social behavior only in older children suggests this positive effect may stem from a desire to avoid shame.",

A person who fails to control their emotions faces lot of problems in day to day life. Even emotional stability results happy and adjustable life therefore emotional stability is an important aspect of human life. Emotional stability is the process in which the personality is continuously striving for greater sense of emotional health, both intra-physically and intra-personally. Emotionally stable individuals are calm and happy, they are satisfied with their life; they deal with the situation in perfect way and solve their problems easily. As population aging becomes more and more pronounced, the concern for mental health and wellbeing of older people is also increasing. With the unprecedented increase in the number of oldest adults, several studies have paid attention to centenarians and their lives exploring factors related to longevity, such as health, generic influences, general life style etc. However, till date in India, research on aging was primarily confined to socio-demographic profiles, problems of and services to the aged etc. As a result certain issues related to the problems of elderly have received in sufficient and one such area is elderly well-being, self-esteem and mental health. Even speculation about the nature of the problem has been difficult because of invisibility and sensitiveness of the problem. The elderly often experience mental health issues and mental disorders. The present study focuses on the emotional stability of the elderly people. The study is descriptive in nature. 102 elderly people were selected for the study.

      "title": "Social phobia in late‐life: is it worth a diagnosis?",
      "abstract": "Despite their high prevalence in older people, anxiety disorders have received scant research attention compared to other common conditions such as depression and dementia. Social phobia is known to be disabling at any age but is likely to be particularly important in late-life because of the recognised associations between social support deficits and many adverse outcomes, including depression (1), dementia (2, 3) and physical disorders such as coronary heart disease (4, 5) and some vascular risk factors (6, 7), as well as enhancing the association between depression and mortality (8). Clearly a person's level of social contact is a mixture of their own preference and environmental imposition. As a source of stress, it is most likely that adverse consequences are highest for people whose social networks are limited against their wishes (for example, through bereavement or limitations imposed by health conditions) rather than those who have always preferred a more solitary existence. Social phobia can be considered as representing an extreme form of the former scenario and, as such, should be taken just as seriously in older compared to younger people, if not more so. The study by Karlsson et al. (9) in this issue is therefore welcome because it provides novel and important information on the temporal stability of the condition in older people both in terms of 'new' cases arising and of 'recovery' in previous cases. As with most affective disorders, the observed prevalence of social phobia at a given time point depends substantially on the instrument and criteria used to define it. Estimates for the prevalence of anxiety disorders in older people have ranged from 1.2% using the GMS-AGECAT diagnostic interview (10) to 14% using DSM-IV criteria (11), while prevalence estimates for any phobic disorder in similar age groups have ranged from 1.4% using the GMS-AGECAT (10) to 25.6% using the Phobic Disorders Screen (12). Previously reported cross-sectional data from the Swedish cohort for which prospective data are described here indicated a one month period prevalence of 1.6% for social phobia if strict DSM-IV criteria were applied (13). While this figure cannot be generalised to other older populations because of the nature of the sample (consisting of 70 year old men and women, and 78 year old women), what was important was that the observed prevalence increased almost two-fold (to 3.5%) if the specific DSM-IV requirement was dropped for 'experiencing the fear as unreasonable or excessive'– i.e. all participants defined in this broader manner still described a fear of a social situation, an avoidance of the feared social situation (or an endurance of it with intense anxiety and distress), and adverse social consequences arising as a result (14). Over-rigorous application of diagnostic criteria may therefore be misleading and, indeed, could be construed as 'ageist' if they are allowed to support potentially false inferences concerning differences in prevalence between age groups which may simply have arisen because older people report a given syndrome in a different manner. If an older person reports a disabling social fear resulting in avoidance of the feared situation, is it reasonable to say that they do not have a phobic disorder (and therefore under-estimate prevalence) if they fail to report the fear as being unreasonable or excessive, perhaps because of a higher level of stoicism (or reluctance to report something as problematic)? On the other hand, research criteria for mental disorders traditionally include some prerequisite effect on function, and it is important to bear in mind that the threshold at which a given level of symptomatology affects daily activities may be determined by other contextual factors. An older person might therefore be more likely to report functional impairment relating to phobic symptoms (i.e. resulting in an over-estimated prevalence) if that function has already been compromised because of physical health worries (e.g. fear of incontinence) or other mental disorders (e.g. mild cognitive impairment). Clearly, the problem here relates to the underlying semantics and applicability of standard diagnostic criteria. Researchers should constantly bear in mind that traditional 'diagnoses' are simply constructs applied to help a clinician communicate with a consulting patient, and that 'research diagnostic criteria' exist to standardise the way in which these constructs are elicited (i.e. their reliability), but that achieving good reliability does not mean that the constructs necessarily have validity (i.e. may not reflect the underlying reality of mental ill-health). A commendable feature of the paper by Karlsson et al.(9) is that it takes a flexible approach to the issue of 'diagnosis' applied in social phobia; in particular, that the analyses apply both the strict DSM-IV criteria and the more loose but probably more clinically realistic definition (labelled here 'clinical social phobia') as well as other sub-clinical and symptomatic categories. The most striking finding from this naturalistic study is that only around a quarter of participants with clinical social phobia at baseline were defined as having this condition 5 years later, and close to one half did not describe any social anxiety at all at follow-up. These proportions were not changed substantially if the baseline 'diagnosis' was restricted to full DSM-IV criteria. Social phobia defined in a community population therefore appears to be a much less stable construct than the chronic condition which has been inferred from prospective clinical research (15). While no data are displayed on treatment received, it is unlikely that the high 'recovery' rate is accounted for by medical or psychological interventions, as common mental disorders are generally poorly recognised or treated in community samples and the report does state that receipt or not of antidepressants at baseline or follow-up was not associated with prognosis in the sample. Spontaneous recovery therefore appears to be the norm for social phobia, and clinicians working with older people, as well as people affected, can surely take heart from this, although as the authors warn, we need to bear in mind that social phobia seen in secondary or tertiary care settings may contain more severe or intractable syndromes than screened cases in community samples. The authors go on to describe the five-year 'incidence' of social phobia (i.e. the proportion fulfilling criteria at follow-up who did not do so at baseline), and describe proportions ranging from 2.0% for DSM-IV social phobia through 4.2% for clinical social phobia, to 16.6% for any social fear. This illustrates the point where traditional constructs applied in epidemiological research begin to fail in the face of conditions for which they are not suited. 'Incidence' of course is typically, and most usefully, applied to an event whose occurrence can be accurately ascertained and located in time (for example, a myocardial infarction or stroke) or to a change of state from health to ill-health where the change is relatively abrupt and where spontaneous recovery from the state of ill-health is unlikely (for example, cancer or diabetes). Mental disorders do not readily fit either of these patterns, either because they develop insidiously (for example, dementia and many cases of psychotic disorder in early adult life) or because they fluctuate in intensity between case/non-case levels. Affective disorders typically follow the latter pattern and present a substantial challenge for researchers who wish to communicate something about their course. Is 5-year incidence a helpful construct for a disorder such as social phobia where only a quarter will continue to experience the disorder after a further 5 years? This problem is accentuated in late adult life because of the greater length of preceding time over which such a fluctuation may have occurred. Most community studies of common mental disorders in older people have relied on 2-wave panel survey designs, similar to the analysis reported here. Disorder 'incidence' or 'onset' tends to refer to its absence at time 1 and presence at time 2. The 'incident' cases include both those who are experiencing their first ever episode at time 2 and those who have had chronic ill-health over a much longer period, perhaps even over most of their life, but whose symptomatology happened to be below case-level at time 1. The non-incident cases include those who remained free of symptoms throughout the follow-up period, those who remained at sub-case levels during that period and those who experienced a case-level episode which had fallen below case-level criteria before the time 2 examination. Clearly all of these groups represent very different levels of mental ill-health; however, they are poorly characterised by the 'incidence' paradigm. The 'recovery' paradigm can be criticised in a similar manner, there being a variety of patterns of change from an initial case-level state, although 2-phase studies do more readily convey clinically useful information, for example, in the case of the study by Karlsson et al. (9)., being able to tell someone with social phobia that, regardless of treatment, they have a nearly 50% chance of not having any social anxiety within 5 years time (although clearly information on shorter-term prognosis would also be helpful). What are the potential solutions? The use of multiple diagnostic 'levels' is a helpful start, as mentioned earlier. However, it is clear that mental health research may have to move beyond 'traditional epidemiology' and forge ahead with new ways of classifying patterns of transitions between health and ill-health over time, just as it has led the way in the field of psychometrics by necessity because of the lack of biological measurements and the reliance on accessing individuals' subjective experiences for standard diagnostic constructs. Psychometrics as a field has made substantial advances in characterising states of health at a single point in time, and perhaps a new discipline of 'prospective psychometrics' is required to quantify the complex ways in which mental health states can fluctuate over weeks, months or years. Reasonable progress has been made in describing the clinical course of conditions which have reached sufficient severity to present to secondary care services (16), as well as some naturalistic research in screened community samples (17), although even these involve relatively crude categorisation of different course patterns which do not move very far beyond the 'rule of thirds' beloved of medical students for describing outcomes for most chronic conditions. Characterisation of longer-term course is more challenging and will involve a move beyond simple two-phase designs with shorter intervals between multiple examinations to plot symptom changes more accurately, as well as transitions between states with differing symptom predominance (e.g. between generalised anxiety and depressive syndromes). A certain amount of retrospective recall is likely to be necessary if fluctuations between examinations are to be quantified. However, attempts to define 'lifetime' disorders in older people are likely to prove more problematic given evidence that even major depressive episodes are very poorly recalled 25 years later (18). Finally, just as the field of 'cross-sectional psychometrics' has provided the mathematical models for quantifying symptom clustering and underlying dimensions, so 'prospective psychometrics' needs the further development of mathematical models which take the field beyond simple 'incidence' and 'maintenance' categorisation.",

      "title": "DO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FEEL EXCLUDED? COMPARISON OF LEARNING AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Little prior research has examined altitudinal differences between those with learning and physical disabilities, but an enhanced understanding can be critical to institutions in order to better work with people across range of disability types. Then are expected to be specific differences in disability attitudes between people with physical and learning disabilities. People with physical disabilities are hypothesised to report greater feelings of exclusion, pride, and social activism, whereas people with learning disabilities will have greater tendency to value treatment assistance from doctors. Hypotheses were generally supported. Attitudes of people with physical disabilities are often different from those of people with learning disabilities, distinction that requires understanding, acknowledgment, sensitivity and appmpriate interaction.Keywords: learning disability; physical disability; attitudes; orientation; social; exclusion1. IntroductionAccording to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (U.S. Department of Justice, 1991), disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.... The U.S. Census Bureau (2003) describes and tracks certain types of disabilities, some more physical and some more learning-oriented. For example a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying would be classified as physical disability. Sensory disabilities, such as blindness, deafness, or severe vision or hearing impairment, might also be considered more physical in nature. However, difficulty remembering, or concentrating would more accurately describe learning disability. According to U.S. Census data for the year 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003), there are 30.5 million people with physical, sight or hearing disabilities, and 12.4 million with disabilities relating to learning, remembering, or concentrating.Learning disabilities are disorders that affect the ability to understand or use spoken or written language, do mathematical calculations, coordinate movements, or direct attention (National Institutes of Health, 2011). Learning disabilities occur in very young children, but are not usually recognized until school age. About 8 to 10 percent of American children under 18 years old have some type of learning disability (National Institutes of Health, 2011). Thus, learning disabilities are prevalent but are more difficult to recognize and define in comparison to physical disabilities.There can be tension between two alternatives for people with learning disabilities: 1) passing as non-disabled, thus avoiding immediate potential stigmatization, but risking unintended exposure; and 2) proactive disclosure, acknowledging potential stigmatization and getting assistance for the disability. Of course, there are many alternatives in between, in which disclosure can be made selectively to certain individuals but not others. It has been suggested that learning disabilities can be more stressful and psychologically damaging than physical disabilities, because of ambivalence regarding disclosure (Patterson and Blum, 1996). This leads to interesting questions regarding the emotional and cognitive processing dynamics of people with learning disabilities, in contrast to those with physical disabilities.The purpose of the current research is to specifically compare, for people with learning versus physical disabilities, specific attitudes toward their disability. Those with physical disabilities are more likely to define themselves as disabled, because their disabilities are more obvious and affect many aspects of their lives. Those with learning disabilities, on the other hand, may feel normal in many life situations which do not involve cognitive prowess (family life, sports, social events, etc.), potentially providing more incentive to pass as non-disabled. …",

      "title": "Identification in the socialization process",
      "abstract": "This development of the child is all the more remarkable when we consider the magnitude of the task. The impatient, self-centered, pleasure-seeking infant, concerned only with himself and with his own survival, is somehow induced within the child-parent relationship to defer his pleasures, consider others, become educated, develop self-control and eventually to assume some degree of responsibility in his society. This important process cannot be taken for granted as something that occurs inevitably and automatically; we have too many failures in socialization in our society for that, as the great number of delinquents, neurotics, and the maladjusted about us reveal. Mother-wisdom, valuable as it is, is inextricably related to personal adjustment and cultural patterns; instinct alone does not provide a guide. Great thinkers of the past have developed rich but incredibly varied views on the nature of the child. The infant has been regarded as a being full of original sin, as an imperfect small adult, as one who comes from Heaven trailing clouds of glory, or as one who is born free and then enslaved by society. These half-truths have not been enough to serve as a basis for the development of a sound philosophy and psychology of the parent-child relationship. So far the relatively new science of psychology, from which we have expected so much, has offered us disappointingly inconsistent views of the child in its various schools of thought. In the behavioristic school, the child is regarded more or less as a bundle of conditioned reflexes which can be established or eliminated in a scientific fashion. Developing as it did, during America's adjustment to the machine age, this view of the child lent itself to treatment of the infant in a hygienic, impersonal manner. Even today many mothers",

      "abstract": "The belief that people are generally fair and trustworthy has generated plenty of scholarly attention in recent decades, particularly in the Scandinavian countries, which are often known for high levels of social trust. This article draws attention to the current discussion in the literature on whether social trust is a stable cultural trait marked by persistence or is based on experiences and subject to change throughout life. Based on unique longitudinal data from five different cohorts of young people in Sweden, ranging in age from 13 to 28 years, this article provides an empirical contribution on how social trust develops over time. The results show that there is a greater degree of instability in social trust between 13 and 15 years of age than in other age groups, and that social trust appears to stabilize with age. Findings also indicate that there are substantial inter‐individual differences in social trust among young people within the same age group, both in initial levels and in the rates of change over time. The article concludes that although social trust is relatively stable it tends to crystallize in early adulthood, highlighting the relevance of the impressionable‐years hypothesis.",

Зростання числа тяжких насильницьких злочинів, безкарність багатьох злочинів, побоювання помсти з боку злочинців – все це свідчить про те, що реальна кількість тяжких статевих злочинів, яким є зґвалтування, у два-три рази перевищує офіційні дані. Суспільна небезпека статевих злочинів визначається перш за все посяганням на статеву свободу або статеву недоторканість особи, а також заподіянням шкоди здоров'ю, честі та гідності особи, нормальному фізичному психічному і соціальному розвитку дітей і підлітків. Небезпечність зґвалтування визначається тим, що воно може тягти за собою тяжкі наслідки, шкідливо впливає на психіку і здоров’я потерпілої особи, нерідко призводить до розірвання шлюбу, сприяє поширенню розпусти, знижує культурний рівень суспільства.

      "title": "It Isn’t Just Them",
      "abstract": "It Isn’t Just Them Kathryn Lofton51 For some time I thought about the problem of sex abuse by clergy as a historian of religion and as a person who grew intellectually through reading queer and feminist theory. But over the last several years I have increasingly considered such abuses in the context of ongoing revelations about misconduct in higher education. When I was thinking intensely about sex abuse in the lead-up to a conference, “Sex Abuse and the Study of Religion,” that I hosted with Robert Orsi and Terence McKiernan at Yale in September 2011, I came across this description of the web of emotions that occurs in sexually abusive relationships from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: The child of five or older who knows and cares for the abuser becomes trapped between affection or loyalty for the person, and the sense that the sexual activities are terribly wrong. If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence or loss of love. When sexual abuse occurs within the family, the child may fear the anger, jealousy or shame of other family members, or be afraid the family will break up if the secret is told.52 Within the documentary materials available, this standardized profile of abuse is rendered relentlessly specific to Catholicism. Sexual abuse is a practice within an existent relational dynamic, one that simultaneously transforms and calcifies the hierarchies and codes that determined the original affiliation. For me it would be absurd to talk about Roman Catholic sex abuse in today’s context without also thinking about what learning about it can help us understand about the hierarchical spaces in which scholars spend so much of our time. If abuse is a ritual practice of hierarchy, then it might be inevitable that institutions—academic and Roman [End Page 26] Catholic—include significant abuse. Consider the above description from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Note how it described that the child becomes trapped between affection for their abuser and recognition of the wrong they make; how they know what they are doing is wrong, but they can’t break from that wrong abuse because they might then experience other repercussions, including, most chillingly, loss of love. How many situations of abuse in the academy occur on the exact same terms? That the abused person needs the relationship, needs that bad love, they think, more than the freedom from it. Why? Because if they say what is happening is wrong, they don’t just destroy this particular relationship. As is written: “When sexual abuse occurs within the family, the child may fear the anger, jealousy or shame of other family members, or be afraid the family will break up if the secret is told.” Nobody wants to break up with love—the love of a caretaker, the love of knowledge. Even more: nobody wants to break up with the container in which the love is transferred: the family, the church, or the university. What if the secret of the academy is told? To tell the truth of one abuse of power is to show the abuse of power that suffuses the whole system. Because while every story is particular, every individual faculty member or student singular, the refrain once told is not: “I was afraid to tell the truth. I worried that I wouldn’t get a good letter of recommendation. I worried I wouldn’t get a job.” We are silent because the system keeps us in it by our desire to stay in it, to keep it, to keep open the possibility that we could become a part of it. I need the family, I need this job; I need these more than I need my security from the harm they do me. This is a very, very hard problem to solve. Our love of learning, and of the institutions that facilitate our learning, is a tender thing. We want to stay in it: to be in that place. We want to be in it—we will lie to keep ourselves in it. We will cover up the pain it...",

      "title": "The Evolutionary Basis for Human Tolerance – Physiological Responses",
      "abstract": "For most animals, unfamiliar members of other groups present more of a threat than an opportunity, and are best avoided or even attacked. In contrast, our attitudes are markedly different. There is no denying that we are capable of being hostile to people we do not know, particularly if we feel anxious or threatened. However, compared to other animals, we are unusually open to new relationships, and form strong bonds with individuals outside our family group. Although we tend to focus on the ‘thinking’ part of our minds, or our cognitive appraisal of social situations, our physiological responses and emotional reactions play a central role in how we build and maintain relationships. Subtle changes in ‘gut feelings’ can have an important influence on our attitudes to people around us, particularly to unfamiliar outsiders or people we have not seen for some time. An understanding of how different hormones affect social behaviour in other species, as well as in humans, provides insights into the type of changes that led to increasing human ‘friendliness’. Genetic and anatomical evidence documents subtle changes in neuroendocrine function in recent human evolution after 300,000 years ago that appear to have played an important role in increasing tolerance of unfamiliarity, and abilities to forge new external bonds. Being able to make external connections, and form new relationships based on give and take despite lengthy periods apart, seems to have been important to our success as a species. Friends in distant communities may often have been important to survival by providing resources or help that could buffer the effects of crises and resource shortfalls. We find that it is genuine emotional commitments to distant friends, rather than strategic alliances, that allow modern hunter-gatherers to survive in times of crisis. Changes in emotional dispositions towards being less aggressive and more tolerant of unfamiliar individuals might seem to be progress, but we should be cautious in thinking in these terms. Increased ‘friendliness’ is not without its disadvantages. It also brings downsides in terms of social sensitivities and emotional vulnerabilities that influence much of human behaviour.",

      "abstract": "The imaginary audience of 328 early and late adolescents was studied from the viewpoint of providing educators and clinicians with insight into its attributes--those which both facilitate and hinder youths' development. Early adolescents (about 14 or 15 years of age) displayed a greater awareness of an imaginary audience which probably contributed to their observed, elevated group dependence. Unexpectedly, the shyness of adolescents highly sensitive to an imaginary audience increased with age, possibly because they are unwilling to provide themselves with the social experiences necessary for decentering. Likewise, those highly sensitive to an imaginary audience projected low self-concepts and thus imply that their audience is relatively critical; thus, they probably validate a self-fulfilling prophecy, oblivious to a possible contradictory external reality. The anticipated fact that females appeared to be less socially bold and more group dependent than males might account, in part, for females' greater responsiveness to an imaginary audience. It is suggested that educators and clinicians encourage youth to validate social hypotheses in order to promote the dissolution of the imaginary audience, especially of those who are shy and display self-deprecatory tendencies.",

The needed explicit policy creates political and ethical issues the former because competing interests are involved and the latter because priorities need to be given to competing values and accommodations between competing standards or criteria of evaluation have to be reached. The 2 ethical issues of freedom and justice in the limitation of population require top priority. Volunteer family planning is ethically appealing but in the interest of both security and survival some compromise is necessary. Designed incentives is just such a compromise for it allows the individual free choice while encouraging planning. Support of both planned parenthood and a policy of incentives for limiting population is rational and ethically responsible behavior at this time. Dilemmas of justice arise when the unit of ethical consideration is the nation tribe or ethnic group rather than the individual. Most people become disturbed to think of the prevailing population as different from themselves. The difficulty is to reach agreement on the structure of an optimum population. Presently the problem appears to be beyond ethical or political solution for justice can neither be defined nor attained in the realm of population policy as long as there continues to be injustice in relations between races and ethnic groups or between classes and nations.",

      "abstract": "The concept of ‘social exclusion,’ which entered our vocabulary only recently, covers a wide variety of social discriminations, deprivations, and denials of equal social opportunities to different groups or sections of society. Broadly speaking, it refers to the exclusion of groups of people from access to such things as are considered normal or taken for granted by others in society. It covers far more than the exclusions rooted in India's historical divisions on lines of caste, religion, and gender; it includes discrimination against minorities, Dalits, tribals, widows, sex-workers, migrants, nomadic tribes, etc. Exclusion is also the fate of the communities displaced by pro-business development projects, the slum-dwellers, the poor, the shelterless or homeless, the child labourers, the street children (a recent estimate put the number of street children in India at 15 million – 15 per cent of the global count). Both the state and society are implicated in different forms of social exclusion. Much of the responsibility for not only the persistence but also extension of such social inequities and deprivations in our society may be traced largely to the inability or failure of the state in meeting its constitutional obligations. The basic problem lies, of course, in the structural arrangements in our society, which tend to determine how the state's largely non-inclusive institutions and processes would operate. When governance is poor and the state backtracks from its presumed obligations in the social sector, it is the most vulnerable sections such as the poor and the low caste that are most adversely affected and disabled.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The authors suggest that the concept of loss may serve as an organizing principle to clarify many of the dynamics of close relationships. Prior to the ultimate loss of the relationship, there may be intermediate losses that undermine relationship stability. Research on social allergies, or extreme responses to minor annoyances, suggests that relatively mild antigens, if frequently repeated, can gradually cause a loss of feelings of idealization of the partner, comfort with the partner, or feelings of being cared about or respected by the partner. Larger problems may cause loss of major elements of love. The loss of physical attractiveness may, depending on the partner's attributions, be associated with the loss of passion. The loss of desired levels of social support may lead to the loss of intimacy, whereas the loss of customary levels of interdependent behavior may lead to a loss of commitment. The loss of honesty in the relationship may lead to a cascade of other losses. Finally, the partner's differing perspectives on the loss can lead to account-making and the deriving of meaning from the loss.",

Here, we assess the extent to which individuals engage in dishonest behavior aimed at helping or harming others after they experience (un)fair treatment. Across three financially incentivized experiments, recipients in a dictator game received a fair or unfair amount and then could, by means of dishonesty, inflate or deflate their counterparts’ pay. Results show that dishonest helping is a common and robust behavior. Individuals lie to help others after fair, unfair, and no prior treatment. Dishonest harming, however, is less prevalent. Only after unfair treatment, some, but not all, individuals engage in dishonest harming. Dishonest harming was associated with high levels of anger and disappointment, and low levels of gratitude. Interestingly, the source of (un)fairness, whether it is intentional or not, did not attenuate peoples’ behavior, suggesting that dishonest reactions to (un)fairness were driven by the mere (un)fair treatment, and not by a motivation to reciprocate an (un)fair counterpart.",

Adolescent development is classified into three stages: early adolescence (11-14 years old), middle adolescence (15-17 years old), and late adolescence (18-21 years old). The developments that occur in adolescence are very diverse, such as language, cognitive, physical motor skills, and social emotions. This is often not understood by adolescents and leaves many confused. Many adolescents have a misconception about their identity, so many of them fall into promiscuity. Adolescents are at risk of experiencing promiscuity, promiscuity is a form of deviant behavior, where \"free\" means crossing the boundaries of existing religious norms, such as free sex, drugs, and acts of violence. This promiscuity can be triggered by increasingly sophisticated technology and cultural exchange. Promiscuity is one of the major challenges facing today's young generation. Thus, it is necessary to conduct outreach that provides an understanding of the urgency of developmental tasks for adolescents entering high school to maximize adolescent development. The seminar, titled \"Socialization of Prevention and Impact of Free Association at SMKS MAHADIKA 1 JAKARTA,\" is expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the importance of the impact of free association and how adolescents can prevent it.",

Gender-diverse people may be gender nonconforming, gender nonbinary, gender fluid, gender exploring, transgender, and so forth. Some gender-diverse individuals experience gender dysphoria and/or gender incongruence and may require gender-affirming supports, including gender-affirming medical interventions. The co-occurrence of autism and gender diversity has been highlighted in a series of studies internationally as well as through rich community expressions. Studies in gender-referred individuals reveal high rates of autism traits as well as high rates of existing autism diagnoses. Studies in autistic populations reveal greater gender diversity characteristics. The long-term course of gender diversity in autistic individuals is poorly understood. Clinical guidelines have been developed for adolescents with the co-occurrence, but much work remains: No gender-related measures have been developed and tested for use in neurodiverse populations, no programs exist to support gender-diverse neurodiverse adults, and little is known about co-occurring mental health profiles, risks, or protective factors for people with the co-occurrence. The inclusion of this chapter on co-occurring autism and gender diversity within a book on “co-occurring psychiatric conditions” is problematic, because gender diversity is not a “psychiatric condition,” but instead a form of human diversity. The diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria is useful only insomuch as it allows individuals to obtain necessary gender-related supports. The authors’ choice to include this chapter in this book reflects a compromise, motivated by the need for educating both autism and gender specialists in this common co-occurrence.",

      "title": "Lessons Learned from Child Sexual Abuse Research: Prevalence, Outcomes, and Preventive Strategies",
      "abstract": "Until recently, there was much disagreement as to what should be included in the definition of CSA [1]. In some definitions, only contact abuse was included, such as penetration, fondling, kissing, and touching [2]. Noncontact sexual abuse, such as exhibitionism and voyeurism, were not always considered abusive. Nowadays, the field is evolving towards a more inclusive understanding of CSA that is broadly defined as any sexual activity perpetrated against a minor by threat, force, intimidation, or manipulation. The array of sexual activities thus includes fondling, inviting a child to touch or be touched sexually, intercourse, rape, incest, sodomy, exhibitionism, involving a child in prostitution or pornography, or online child luring by cyberpredators [3,4]. CSA experiences vary greatly over multiple dimensions including, but not limited to: duration, frequency, intrusiveness of acts perpetrated, and relationship with perpetrator. Although sexual activity between children has long been thought to be harmless, child on child CSA experiences, such as those involving siblings, is increasingly being recognized as detrimental for the emotional well-being of children as adult on child CSA [5-7]. While adult-to-child interactions in which the purpose is sexual gratification are considered abusive, sexual behaviours between children are less clear-cut as there is no universal definition of sexual abuse that differentiates it from normal sex play and exploration [8]. Although a 2to 5-year age difference between children was first suggested as necessary to consider sexual behaviours between siblings to be incest [9], this criterion is being questioned as studies have shown this age difference to be much lower in many substantiated cases of child-to-child abuse [10]. This formulation of CSA is in keeping with the recommendations from the 1999 World Health Organization Consultation on Child AbusePrevention, where CSA is defined as any activity of a sexual nature 'between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person'. That said, some definitional issues have not yet been resolved in the field. First, much disparity exists regarding age for sexual consent, or age for sexual maturity, which has an influence on the extent to which statutory sex offenses are considered CSA. Sexual activities that involve a person below a statutorily designated age fall under the large umbrella of CSA; however, the age of consent varies greatly across countries, from as young as 12 or 13 (e.g. Tonga, Spain) to 17 or 18 years of age (e.g. some states in the US, Australia). In virtually all European jurisdictions, sexual relations are legal from age 16 onwards, but some countries have set the age for sexual consent at 14 or 15 [11]. In other words, when no coercion or force is used, cases that involve sexual activities between an adult and, for example, a 14-year-old teenager, will be either perceived as a consensual sexual relationship or criminalized and defined as sexual abuse, depending on the legal statutorily designated age of the country where the event occurred. In Canada, a bill was recently adopted to change the age of consent from 14 to 16, a premiere in Canada's history, which emphasizes the impact governmental decisions can have on definitional issues of CSA in societies over time [12]. Second, although coerced sexual activities that occur in dating or romantic relationships is recognized as a form of sexual violence by the World Health Association (see for example a WHO multicountry study from Garcia-Moreno and colleagues [13]), the extent to which this form of interpersonal violence is socially recognized and acknowledged in different legislations around the world is unclear.",

Extra judical executions in Manipur, mostly of young men, have resulted in the proliferation of young widows and orphans.

In such cases persistent and methodical investigation tends to yield a consensually credible view of what really happened without resort to special forensic techniques of truth-finding. In order to make a diagnosis of incest hoax, the investigator must thoroughly understand the mechanics of the hoax and the psychodynamics of the perpetrator. Failure to recognizing a delusional hoax can delay treatment for the perpetrator of the hoax. Failure to recognize a child's fabrication can subject the family to unnecessary legal action and unwittingly support the use of a similar manipulative technique by other susceptible children. Failure to recognize the false retraction of an incest accusation may leave the victim in danger of further sexual abuse or of physical punishment for having revealed the secret.",

      "title": "Euthanasia and normality in Romania or Being reluctant to a good death",
      "abstract": "Thinking about usually brings by feelings of fear and restlessness. Notwithstanding age, gender or profession, the end of life is rather connected to anxiety than to peacefulness. Still, as they get old, people tend to preoccupy more about when and how their life journey would end up. Aging causes varying levels of fear, anxiety, and apprehension each person. Biosocial, cognitive, and psychosocial changes as one ages cause people to realize their own mortality. Attitudes of aging and go together, because as people get older they are concerned with their own mortality (Benton, 2007 Suslick, 2013).Due to the continuous development of technology and life maintaining capabilities within health care systems and also due to improving overall living conditions, life expectancy has increased worldwide. Still, sooner or later does occur and postponing the inevitable cannot help individuals from facing the above mentioned feelings of anxiety while being terminally ill or suffering from incurable diseases. Even if you push a little further away you still get to it one way or another.The dilemmas regarding the end of life are neither of recent date nor are they soon to be vanished away. However, the entire progress aimed at bettering humans' life quality determined the re-emergence of an otherwise ancient paradigm regarding death. The consequence is that the end of life is more often considered a matter of how than a matter of when. Once they succeeded to be more and more control of their own lives, people's concern regarding the final act of their living gained importance also. Still, this approach is by no means recent as people are said to have been interested the topic for thousands of years. As a proof for the ancientness of the preoccupation regarding ones' stands euthanasia, a word considered to be coming from the ancient Greece where the procedure itself was widely practiced cases of incurable diseases (Otlowski, 2000, p.1).For the ancient Greek, was similar to a good/ easy and the values imbued within the construction pointed to the person's dying a dignified manner by dealing away with pain and feelings of helplessness.According to the online edition of the English Oxford Dictionary, the term euthanasia was introduced the basic vocabulary around the 17th century as referring to the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or an irreversible coma. Even if at a first sight the dignifying feature of a non-painful seems to have been left out of the recent definitions of euthanasia, it has been largely invoked by the public opinion especially given the prolongation of life on the one hand and the fact that various illnesses as Alzheimer or AIDS remained incurable on the other hand.Voluntary was not immediately embraced by society as a whole. In fact, was considered a taboo subject for a long time. The Catholic Church has been strongly opposing the concept (Otlowski, 2000, p.2) especially by frequently invoking the Fifth Commandment underling the sacredness of life. Still, secularization has diminished the influence of the Church. Moreover, the media made common knowledge out of the topic by introducing the issue of death on the public agenda. As a matter of consequence, in May 1995, ground breaking legislation was enacted the Northern Territory of Australia with the passage of the rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 which legalizes medical assistance dying certain circumstances (idem).At the moment this paper was written, human and/or physicianassisted suicide had been legalized a few European countries as Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Estonia or Albania and also some parts of the United States of America as Washington or Oregon (http://euthanasia.procon.org). As expected, the procedure is facing greater opposition from people and authorities more traditional countries where individualism and self-determination are not of primary importance. …",

      "title": "Why are some individuals more resilient than others: the role of social support",
      "abstract": "Trauma is an inextricable component of the human condition. Most individuals are exposed to one or more traumas during their lifetime, but there is great psychological and neurobiological variability in how people respond to these events. While the majority of individuals are largely psychologically resistant or resilient to the negative consequences of trauma, a significant minority develop chronic, debilitating psychological symptoms that markedly interfere with their capacity to function; others may initially develop symptoms and recover, or develop late or delayed symptoms over time. What explains these differences? The answer is complex and only partially understood. Resilience is generally defined as the ability of an individual to bend but not break, to bounce back, and \"to adapt well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or even significant sources of stress\"1. However, this definition primarily focuses on the individual. In so doing, it fails to explicitly acknowledge that individuals are embedded in social systems, and that these systems may be more or less resilient in their own right, as well as more or less able to support the adaptive psychological capacities of the individual. Thus, responses to trauma and significant stressors are determined by multiple dynamic, interacting individual-level systems (e.g., genetic, epigenetic, developmental, neurobiological), which are embedded in larger social systems (e.g., family, cultural, economic, and political systems). Like resilience, social support is a complex construct with many definitions. One is from Cohen, who defines it as \"a social network's provision of psychological and material resources intended to benefit an individual's capacity to cope with stress\"2; another is from Eisenberger, who defines it as \"having or perceiving to have close others who can provide help or care, particularly during times of stress\"3. There are many facets of social support which, while overlapping to some extent, reflect unique aspects of this construct. These facets include: structural social support (i.e., the size and extent of the individual's social network, frequency of social interactions); functional social support (i.e., the perception that social interactions have been beneficial in terms of meeting emotional or instrumental needs); emotional social support (i.e., behavior that fosters feelings of comfort leading the person to believe that he/she is loved, respected, and/or cared for by others); instrumental/material social support (i.e., goods and services that help solve practical problems); and informational/cognitive social support (i.e., provision of advice or guidance intended to help individuals cope with current difficulties). These facets of social support can be facilitated and maintained by different systems, including family, community, and state, national, and international systems. Notably, while social support is a key correlate of psychological resilience, it is not universally helpful, as its effectiveness may vary by the type of support provided and the extent to which it matches individual's needs, which may change over time. For example, among Iraq/Afghanistan combat veterans, perceptions of family members' understanding of deployment-related concerns (i.e., functional support) was more strongly related to mental health and resilience than structural and instrumental support4. A large body of research has found that psychological resilience is generally fostered by environmental/caregiving conditions during childhood that are loving, emotionally responsive, consistent, and reliable5. This work suggests that, when the environment also provides ample opportunities to master challenges and stresses, it can have an \"inoculating\" or \"steeling\" effect, which can help promote resilience. Such social and environmental conditions can also support the development of individual attributes and skills commonly associated with resilience, including the ability to regulate emotions, self-soothe, solve problems under stress, form secure attachments, sustain friendships and intimate relationships, and acquire a realistic and positive sense of agency/self-efficacy5. However, when the caregiving environment is highly stressful and chaotic, animals and humans are at increased risk for developing exaggerated sympathetic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and emotional and behavioral responses to future stressors, which can persist into adulthood6. Many features of personality are heritable and some of these, such as extraversion and dispositional optimism, are associated with one's capacity to seek and utilize social support. However, the social caregiving environment may influence whether and to what extent these inherited features are actually expressed. For example, short allele carriers of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism were found to be more susceptible to the influence of parenting than long carriers7. Positive social support was also shown to moderate genetic risk for depression in maltreated children8. There is also emerging evidence that one's social environment may moderate genetic vulnerability to stress by triggering epigenetic modification of genes implicated in the stress response system9. Social support appears to be associated with resilience to psychopathology via a number of psychological and behavioral mechanisms, including motivation to adopt healthy and reduce risky behaviors; feelings of being understood; appraisal of potentially stressful events as being less threatening; enhanced sense of control or mastery; increased self-esteem; use of active coping strategies; and impact of social influence and social comparison. For example, in a study of individuals with cardiac disease, high functional and emotional social support (i.e., perceiving understanding from and confiding in family members, work employees, and the broader social network) was associated with increased use of active problem-solving, a coping mechanism that has been associated with resilience in several traumatized populations10. An emerging body of research has shown that threats to social connectedness, such as rejection and loneliness, activate many of the same neurobiological systems associated with physical threats and fear, including the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, sympathetic nervous system, and HPA axis3. In contrast, positive social support has been shown to inhibit activation of fear-related neurobiological systems by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and brain regions, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and caudate, which are implicated in the processing of safety cues3. Positive social support has also been shown to stimulate the release of oxytocin11, which is critical for social cognition and social behaviors, including accurate facial affect identification, social approach, affiliation, perceptions of trustworthiness, and sexual behavior11. Oxytocin has also been shown to have anxiolytic effects and to attenuate physiological, hormonal, and brain-level responses to aversive and potentially stress-inducing signals11. Overall, positive social support, through a variety of neurobiological mechanisms, can have a buffering effect on physiological stress responses, with a resultant salutary effect on mental (e.g., depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) and physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disorders, immune function)3. On the other hand, preclinical and clinical research finds that weak social support and isolation are associated with indicators of compromised physical and mental health. The magnitude of impact of poor social support on all-cause mortality is similar to that of obesity, cigarette smoking and physical inactivity. Social support also influences rates of mental disorders. For example, meta-analytic findings have reported that low post-trauma social support is a consistent risk factor for PTSD12. Psychological interventions to increase individual resilience typically target personal skill development (e.g., training in physical fitness, cognitive reframing, mindfulness, social skills). However, they can also target family and community social systems13. For example, there is substantial evidence that one of the most effective ways to increase resilience in a child is to focus on the well-being and child-rearing skills of his/her parents6. A number of studies and programs have demonstrated that teaching at-risk parents to understand their own needs as well as the emotional and mental needs of their infant/child may enhance attachment security, and reduce a variety of later maladaptive outcomes, including child maltreatment and criminal behavior. Social support from one's community can also help foster resilience in the individual. Community members are strongly affected by the coping strategies of other community members, as well as by the community's capacity to prepare for and deal with adverse events and conditions. This becomes apparent during disasters, when individuals who are linked to pre-existing organizations and communities that are well prepared to deal with adversity tend to fare better than those who are not connected to or supported by community13. Communities can also enhance resilience in the individual through policies and programs that promote safe neighborhoods, affordable housing, food and employment stability, access to healthcare, effective schools, emergency and disaster preparedness, and ample public spaces for relaxation and exercise. Like other animals, humans have been endowed with great potential to weather and adapt to trauma and significant stressors. However, for natural protective systems to develop and operate effectively in the individual, ample social and material resources are necessary. Because resilience is dependent on multiple individual-level systems, which are embedded in larger social systems, future advances in understanding resilience and how to best foster it will require a broad-based multidisciplinary approach.

The dominant explanatory model links suicide to mental disorders, particularly depression, but interesting research contextualizing suicide now provides evidence for a number of different interpretations. Alternative explanatory models, for example, are of suicide as escape from unbearable circumstances or expectations, as a desperate protest or rebellion against family and/or societal oppression and abuse, as a relational rather than an individual act, as a specific way of communicating distress, and/or as a way of taking back lost control in life. Consequences of hegemonic masculinity also seem important for suicide for both men and women, albeit in different ways.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate how teenage boys who had offended against peers in a rape-like way talked about their childhood experiences and about themselves as teenagers. Through the narratives, troubled families in which the boys had experienced neglect, abuse, and lack of monitoring and care become visible. However, on a semantic level, the boys stated that all was good and nothing was bad and recurrent was that these boys seldom found a storyline or a prominent chronology. The boys seemed to want to present an image of not being preoccupied with sex and they seemed to have no discussion partner concerning sexuality. The boys were reluctant to talk about the sexual abuse committed by them, and it was common to describe these assaults as something taking place out of one's control. Many stated a wish to forget the offences they had done due to the pain and distress connected to remembering. For a majority, the role of a rowdy boy and a young troublemaker almost seemed to function as an identity. A part of these boys' “tough attitudes” to life was to state that they did not need anybody and few told of friendships or emotional closeness to others. The boys' experiences of interpersonal rejection, together with a “tough-guy” attitude as young troublemakers, could be interpreted as a foundation for hostile masculinity, described, for example, by Malamuth et al.

Second, the behaviors of concern to most health, exercise, and sport psychologists are not the kinds of behaviors to which this definition of habit applies easily, if at all. Third, the kind of mindless behavior suggested by this definition may be conducive to enhancing physical health and athletic performance, but it may be inconsistent with the essential elements of happiness or subjective well-being according to Eastern philosophies such as Taoism and Buddhism, and according to the growing research on the psychology of happiness.",

Research on health resistance has contributed two central reasons for the deliberate disregard or dismissal of health messages by reasonable people: one, a different definition or interpretation of health and health maintenance (largely encompassing free-will ideas) and two, a suspicion of authority-driven science, medicine, and government-funded communication. These findings ask questions about a strict adherence to a particular idea of human health and life, and a particular format of communicating these ideas.",

      "title": "Abuse Canʼt be Diagnosed Unless it is Suspected",
      "abstract": "Domestic violence is a widespread problem that affects all social, economic, age, racial, and educational groups. The toll that it places on our society as a whole is enormous. The emergency department plays an important role in detecting abuse because it is where most patients seek medical care for trauma injuries. In fact, studies looking at domestic violence have shown that up to 35 percent of all ED visits by women are prompted by domestic violence.1 Battery by a current or former partner accounts for approximately 21 percent of traumatic injuries in women.1 If it is so common, why is domestic violence so often undetected in the emergency department? Obscuring the Source There are many psychosocial causes to obscure the source of trauma. The complex relationship between a woman and her abusive partner presents many barriers to the detection of abuse. Disclosure to the physician risks escalation of the violence, and can affect the relationship in several ways. Many women are economically dependent on their partners, and would risk becoming homeless or losing their children to foster care if they leave. Batterers frequently accompany their victims when they seek medical attention, and are there during the entire visit or threaten to kill the partners or their children if they tell anyone. Denial often plays a strong part, and many patients may not consider themselves mistreated or feel they deserve the abuse. At times, women are protective of their partners because they are loving and affectionate when not being abusive. Many patients fear that what they tell health care providers will not be confidential, and previous failed attempts by support services or physicians to provide help make many patients reluctant to ask for help.2,3 There are many psychosocial barriers to detecting child abuse. Parents may present an explanation of the injury incompatible with physical findings. The caregiver may be reluctant to give information or state the cause of the injury as “unknown.” Children may be threatened by their abuser, and fear disclosure will result in more bodily harm or even break up the family. There are many reasons why elder abuse may go undetected. The elderly may feel embarrassed or guilty about the abuse and withhold information voluntarily. Exposure of the abuse may lead to retaliation by the abuser. Elderly individuals are often dependent, and may fear being removed from the home or placed in a nursing institution. A patient's mental status can pose a barrier to detecting abuse. The elderly often present with dementia and confusion, are overmedicated by their providers, and are poor or inaccurate in providing information. Individuals under the influence of alcohol and drugs or those who are severely depressed present a similar problem. Infants have yet to develop the communication skills needed to divulge information. Incidence of Abuse Statistics show that abuse is more common in our society than many believe. The 1998 Commonwealth Fund Survey of Women's Health states that two of every five women report having experienced at least one type of abuse or violence in their lifetime. In the survey, only 29 percent discussed the abuse with a physician or health care professional. Of those who reported abuse to their doctors, only 44 percent were referred to a support service.4 A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reports that only 13 percent of abused women told staff about the domestic violence or were asked about domestic violence by ED professionals.5 A study looking at homicide victims of domestic violence found that nearly half of the victims had been to the ED within two years of the homicide, and 42 percent of the ED visits were associated with injuries.1 In 1993, the number of abused children in the United States was estimated to be around 1.2 million.6 More than 1000 fatalities result from child abuse each year.7 One study showed that child abuse accounted for 10.6 percent of all blunt traumas to patients under age 5 admitted to several hospitals.8 Elder abuse has been slow in gaining the attention of the general public. The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study estimated that nearly 450,000 elderly persons experienced abuse or neglect in domestic settings in 1996.9 Physical abuse accounts for almost 15 percent of the cases of elder abuse.10 Even if identified, physicians notify the appropriate authorities in only one of every 13 cases of elder abuse.10 Detecting Domestic Violence Since 1992, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations has required that hospitals have written policies and procedures to guide treatment of abused individuals. Because abuse is so prevalent, all patients that enter the emergency department should be routinely screened by either asking questions or providing a written questionnaire. Any suspicion of abuse should warrant further investigation. Remember that health care workers are required by law to report even the suspicion of abuse. Clinical clues that a woman has been battered include delay in seeking care for an injury, injuries inconsistent with history, injuries to the face or trunk, and strangulation injuries. Psychiatric complaints including depression, anxiety symptoms, or substance abuse also are tips to underlying abuse. Anyone who will not allow his partner to be seen alone also should raise the suspicion of abuse.3 There are many historical and clinical findings that are highly suggestive of child abuse. An unusual delay in seeking medical care should raise suspicions of abuse. Lack of a primary care physician, disability, frequent hospitalizations, or history of parental mental illness or substance abuse is a red flag that should heighten the suspicion of abuse. A thorough physical examination is essential in detecting child abuse. The skin exam may show bruises in various stages of healing or bruises over areas of the body that are usually protected — the back, genitals, and abdomen — in infants and toddlers. Circular cigarette burns, loop-shaped marks, “grid” burn marks, human bite marks, circumferential rope burns, and symmetric scald burns on the buttocks or extremities all warrant further laboratory and radiographic testing. Orthopedic injuries often present after a delay in seeking care, and may be more difficult to detect because they are in the later stages of healing. Radiographs should be obtained when there is soft tissue swelling, point tenderness, or when a child refuses to bear weight or move an extremity. Bucket-handle, spiral, transverse, and multiple rib fractures are all strongly suggestive of abuse. Head injuries in children, especially subdural hematomas, are strongly correlated with intentional trauma. Head injuries in infants may present as nonspecific signs such as excessive crying, poor feeding, irritability, lethargy, seizures, coma, apnea, or cardiopulmonary arrest. An ophthalmologic exam should be performed as a screening tool for retinal hemorrhage in infants and small children. In the absence of obviously accidental trauma, a child abuse investigation should be actively considered in cases of head injury.3 Elder abuse is often difficult to detect, and many physicians lack formal training in screening for elder abuse. Patients that are depressed, physically or financially dependent upon others, or live with a stressed or isolated caregiver are at high risk for abuse. Alcohol abuse by the caregiver was the factor most predictive of elder abuse.10 Common physical injuries in elder abuse include unexplained bruises, fractures, lacerations, abrasions, and head injury. Conversely, dehydration and malnutrition, late-stage bed sores, inappropriate clothing, and improper administration of medicines are more often indicators of neglect.10 The emergency department often serves as one of the few outside contacts for patients who are victims of violent relationships and abuse. The lifetime prevalence of domestic violence in more than half of all patients means that no subset of patients is free from the possibility of domestic violence.11 As a rule, emergency physicians should maintain a high level of vigilance and a low threshold for investigating abuse.

We asked 30 persons, 63-96 years old, to give a description of \"being-old\". Our participants differed in sex, health status, and social housing conditions (number of persons living together). The given aspects of \"being-old\" had to be semantically described and evaluated. We got 279 aspects of \"being-old\" which we put into 13 categories. We did not find a generally negative image of \"being-old\". All participants did not assess themselves as being \"old\", regardless of their age. The most frequently cited aspects of \"being-old\" were \"physical and mental activity\", \"achievement-relation\" and \"autonomy\", but not \"disease\" or \"decrease of power\". As far as they are concerned, aspects of \"having time and calmness\" were more often mentioned than aspects of \"being-religious\" or thinking about \"dying and death\". Participants living with their partners or family members more often talked about themselves than singles did when they explained a given aspect of \"being-old\" to the interviewer. Those who live without health problems more often talked about diseases than ill participants did. Women more frequently explained self evaluation of health problems to the interviewer than men.",

Unconscious biases permeate society at three fundamental levels—individual, institutional, and societal. Institutional bias surfaces when policies and procedures at academic institutions and in the workplace sustain practices that put women at a disadvantage. Institutional biases can affect men as well, but in many instances these practices disproportionately affect women. Societal bias has to do with ingrained beliefs and assumptions about preferences and abilities (those based on gender in this instance) that govern a society's norms and help shape its culture. They are systemic in nature and as such can have a powerful influence on behavior. Institutional policies, such as family leave and spousal accommodation, attempt to mitigate some of the issues women face by providing a forum for dialogue, specifically about work-life issues.",

All three dimensions of RSB are subjected to influence by several factors – biomedical, psycho-socio-cultural and interpersonal.

      "abstract": "There has been an increase in research on sexual activity in later life, yet far less is known about the actual perceptions and experiences of older adults who refrain from sexual activity. In the current study, a thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns in semi-structured interviews with 47 older adults, aged 60-91. The analysis yielded seven themes that describe why older adults refrain from sex: 1) avoiding confronting sexual dysfunctions, 2) avoiding confronting the aging body, 3) avoiding performance anxiety, 4) being uninterested in sexual activity, 5) taking time to grieve the loss of a partner, 6) avoiding judgment, and 7) seeing sexuality as evolving and changing. Themes were organized according to the bio-psycho-social perspective and based on the axis of personal (self-focused) and interpersonal (partner-focused) motives. It is perfectly acceptable for people to refrain from sexual activity for their own reasons. However, if older adults want to remain sexually active, they should receive complete information about the many possibilities of treating different sexual problems in later life and about the many ways, beyond sexual penetration, one can enjoy sexual activity even in old age.",

      "title": "Personal identity",
      "abstract": "The ‘problem of personal identity’ as it is usually construed in philosophy is a special case of more general questions about the identity of objects over time. There are a variety of puzzles about how a single object can persist through change, and these puzzles run especially deep in the case of persons, due to their complexity and the number of dimensions along which they can alter. More concretely, those working on the problem of personal identity investigate the question of what makes a woman of 50 the same person as the girl she was at 15, despite the fact that she may resemble that girl in very few respects. This question is a metaphysical question about numerical identity, aimed at defining the necessary and sufficient conditions for the literal persistence of one and the same entity through time. It is thus distinguished from epistemological questions which ask what evidence we use to make judgements of personal identity, and also from psychological or sociological questions which ask about identity in the sense of the stability of a unique personality or character. Historically there have been three main answers to the problem of personal identity. One defines identity in terms of the continuation of a single immaterial substance or soul; one in terms of psychological continuity; and one in terms of biological continuity. All of these views have had their adherents, but it is now widely accepted that sameness-of-soul views have too many difficulties to provide a truly tenable account of personal identity, and most recent discussions of personal identity focus on the relative merits of psychological and biological accounts. For much of the latter half of the twentieth century psychological accounts represented by far the predominant approach to questions of personal identity. These views, inspired by John Locke’s claim that personal identity should be defined in terms of sameness of consciousness rather than sameness of substance, hold that a person at time t2 is the same as a person at earlier time t1 just in case there is an overlapping chain of psychological connections (memories, beliefs, desires, etc.) between the person at t2 and the person at t1. They have a great deal of intuitive appeal, capturing the widely held sense that if biological and psychological continuity were to diverge, the person would go where the psychological life goes, but they have also been subject to some important objections. Many of these are related to the fact that psychological continuity does not have the same logical form as identity. For instance, a person existing now could in principle be psychologically continuous with two people in the future, but cannot be identical to both of them since they are not identical to each other. Biological accounts of identity have recently re-emerged with new vigour, mounting a serious challenge to the dominance of psychological accounts. Defenders of the biological approach say that we are, most fundamentally, human animals who persist as long as a single human organism does. The biological approach allows that psychological continuity may be of tremendous importance to us, and that we may ‘identify’ with our psychological states, but insists this continuity is no part of what determines our literal persistence as single entities. Biological theorists point out that if we think of persons as entities distinct from human animals we will be left with a number of awkward questions about the relation between persons and animals, making psychological continuity theories deeply implausible. In response, defenders of the psychological approach have argued that biological accounts suffer from many of the same deficits with which they charge psychological theories. Also, constitution theorists have offered a new kind of psychological account that avoids the problems traditional psychological theorists face in explaining the relation of persons to human animals. The debate between these psychological and biological approaches to identity is ongoing. In addition, several new kinds of account of personal identity have been defended, including minimalist views that place identity in the continuation of rudimentary psychological capacities and narrative views that see persons as narrative in form and define the unity of a person’s life as a narrative unity. Recently, the problem of personal identity has also played an important role in bioethical debates. This has led to a more general investigation of the relation between metaphysical questions of personal identity and practical judgements.",

      "title": "Becoming an emerging adult: Demographic and cultural factors, coping style, and coping self-efficacy as predictors of exploration and commitment during the resolution of an emerging adult's identity crisis",
      "abstract": "Throughout the course of human history, individuals have been forced to face a vast array of stressful situations. Each of these experiences and encounters required adequate management, if not to ensure survival, then to provide education or protection. Simultaneously, human beings were diversifying, establishing groups based on physical and cognitive representations, values, beliefs, and other environmentally based concepts. What appeared to emerge is the idea of culture, a concept developed out of vastness that is the human being, and a need for individual identities. The current investigation examined these concepts, guided by six research hypotheses (a) when combined, the demographic and cultural factors of age, gender, ethnicity, religious or spiritual affiliation, and religious or spiritual service attendance are significant predictors of levels of exploration and commitment during identity conflict resolution of emerging adults, (b) when combined, the demographic and cultural factors of age, gender, ethnicity, religious or spiritual affiliation, and religious or spiritual service attendance are significant predictors of selected dispositional and situation specific coping approaches, (c) when combined, the demographic and cultural factors of age, gender, ethnicity, religious or spiritual affiliation, and religious or spiritual service attendance are significant predictors of the self-efficacy of implemented coping styles, (d) dispositional and situation specific coping behaviors are significant predictors of levels of exploration and commitment during identity conflict resolution, (e) self-efficacy in the implemented coping behaviors is a significant predictor of levels of exploration and commitment during identity conflict resolution, and (f) when combined, dispositional coping, situation specific coping, and self-efficacy of implemented coping behaviors are significant predictors of levels of exploration and commitment during identity conflict resolution.\n\tA sample (n = 246), drawn from a public college campus in the Southeastern United States, was asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and four self-report questionnaires aimed at exploring each of the six research hypotheses. Collected data were analyzed using hypothesis specific multiple regression analyses. The regressions suggested that selection of various coping styles are predicted by demographic and cultural variables. It was further suggested that the selected coping styles and a combination selected coping style and self-efficacy of the selected style are predictive of exploration and commitment during the resolution of the emerging adult identity crisis. Accompanying the results are theoretical and conceptual implications, limitations of the findings, and implications for practice and research.",

      "abstract": "are stable to the extent that causal factors are expected to be long-lived or recurrent rather than short-lived or intermittent.Attributions are global to the extent that causes are believed to affect a broad range of situations rather than a limited set of circumstances.An individual who responds to failure on a mathematics test by saying \"I'll always be a failure in everything I do\" exhibits rather extreme internal, stable, and global attributions for the failure.On the other hand, an individual who responds to a similar situation by saying \"Some of the questions in this week's test were extraordinarily difficult\" exhibits external, unstable, and specific attributions.The reformulated learned helplessness model holds that individuals who make internal attributions for perceived noncontingency are likely to suffer deficits of self-esteem, and to blame themselves for events they believe they cannot control.It is also hypothesized that stable attributions will tend to extend the duration of deficits over time, and that global attributions are likely to result in the generalization of deficits to a variety of situations.Thus, the hypothesized depressive attributional style, consisting of internal, stable, and global attributions for undesired outcomes, is posited to lead to an expectation of future noncontingency and thus to symptoms of helplessness.According to the model, individuals with this type of attributional style are more likely to become depressed when faced with important life events that are perceived as uncontrollable.Abramson et al. (1978) further suggest that the model has preventative implications in that it may be possible to identify people who are depression-prone prior to the actual onset of depression by assessing their attributional style.In a subsequent publication, Seligman, Abramson, Semmel, and von Baeyer (1979) addressed themselves more specifically to the notion of a depressive attributional style.An attributional style questionnaire (Peterson, Semmel, von Baeyer, Abramson, Metalsky, & Seligman, Note 1) was developed to assess each of the three relevant attributional dimensions.The questionnaire yields scores for each dimension as well as a composite attributional score.The authors found that for hypothetical negative outcomes, internal, stable, global, and composite scores each correlated significantly with measures of depression in a group of college undergraduates.Seligman et al. (1979) concluded that their findings supported both the notion of a depressive attributional style and the reformulated learned helplessness model of depression..They did point out that the \"model predicts that the insidious attributional style for bad outcomes does not by itself result in depression\" (Seligman et al., 1979, p. 246), but that depression ensues when these types of attributions are made for important life events.Although not made explicit by the authors, the assumption seems to be that the more strongly an individual exhibits this attributional style for hypothetical situations, the more likely the individual is to make similar attributions for important life events, and thus the more likely to become depressed following such events.A number of questions arise from the Seligman et al. (1979) study.The most obvious, as pointed out by the authors, is whether the results generalize to other populations.A second question is to what extent attributional style, as assessed by the Peterson et al. (Note 1) scale, has predictive value in identifying depression-prone individuals prior to the onset of depression.As Seligman et al. (1979) have noted, their study supports the hypothesis that depression and attributional style are related, at least in college undergraduates, but does not inform us as to the direction of the relationship.It may be interesting to examine whether individuals identified as depression-prone according to their attributional",

In seemingly equal relationships such as that between spouses, people nonetheless influence or cajole their peers to have their own way. The exercise of power relies partly on strategic communication, and even seemingly powerless individuals may triumph over the more powerful. Just as individuals exercise power over others, they also have the experience of being overpowered by others.",

Interference obtains to the extent that enactment of certain roles tends to impede the enactment of others. High degrees of interference in the performance of roles is generally frustrating to individuals and is a potential generator of outwardly directed violence. Low degrees of role interference is likewise disconcerting to persons but in the absence of an external target for aggression may lead to self deprecation and ultimately suicide. Detailed life histories of 98 suicide victims, 62 homicide offenders, and 76 non-violent individuals having no history of homicidal or suicidal behavior were studied. Homicide offenders suffered a higher incidence of role interference than the suicide or non-violent samples. Suicide victims tended to experience low degrees of such interference.",

Such decisions may be quite trivial, for example which pair of trousers we should wear, or major, for example to move home. The freedom to make such decisions may be called the right to self-determination or autonomy. For adults, such a right is recognised by the law, either explicitly as in USA or more implicitly as here in the United Kingdom. Such a right is also partially acknowledged in children although if the child or young person is not capable of making a reasoned decision then the parent or guardian may make the decision on their behalf. Some adults through mental disability (mental illness, mental handicap) have a diminished ability to make reasoned decisions. However, it is important to recognise that in any given situation there should be an assessment of the person's ability to make a reasoned decision and assumptions not made for convenience's sake. Even people with substantial intellectual impairment are capable of making some decisions.",

This article questions one key part of that theory: the hypothesis that children recognize disgust from its purported facial signal. Over the first 5 years, children experience disgust, produce facial expressions of disgust, develop a concept of disgust, understand and produce the word disgust or a synonym, know about disgust's causes and consequences, and infer disgust in others from a situation or a behavior. Yet, only gradually do these children come to \"recognize\" disgust specifically from the \"disgust face\" found in standardized sets of the facial expressions of basic emotions. Improvement is gradual, with more than half of children matching the standard disgust face to disgust only at around 9 years of age and with subsequent improvement continuing gradually until the late teens or early adulthood. Up to age 8, a majority of children studied believe that the standard disgust face indicates anger. Rather than relying on an already known signal value, children may be actively learning to interpret the expression.",

Inescapably, the way these responses are studied and understood is influenced by prevailing explanatory concepts, and characteristic features of social control in the society in which scientists happen to live. Thus in modern Western society, the common and social psychological vocabulary used to describe responses to deviance strongly favors terms such as stereotype, prejudice, labeling, stigmatization, or discrimination to emphasize that these responses are primarily derived from mental constructions and malicious motives, and that deviant conditions themselves rarely pose objective problems for society and hence demand behavioral responses. These descriptions also reflect the fact that current Western society basically values tolerance or self-control as the major way of responding to deviance, while delegating the actual work of prevention, conflict resolution, punishment, or healing to formal institutions such as the police, court rooms, or centers for disease control and health promotion.",

      "abstract": "Theological responses to gender variance that object to gender transition sometimes do so, as we have seen, for distinct moral or doctrinal reasons. Often, however, objections are more ethical and pragmatic, prompted, at least ostensibly, by concerns about health. Sometimes objectors suspect – in defiance of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the World Health Organization, and various mainstream therapeutic bodies – that gender dysphoria and/or a desire to transition gender are themselves pathological, pointing to underlying mental illness. Sometimes there are concerns that apparent gender dysphoria masks deeper underlying problems such that people who believe that they want to transition will actually be no better off afterwards than they were before. And there has been particular anxiety in recent years about an apparent mental health crisis amongst young people, which has coincided with higher numbers of young people (especially those assigned girls at birth) seeking transition. In this situation, it may be unclear whether gender dysphoria is something with its own independent reality or a side effect of mental health problems whose most appropriate treatments may not include support for transition. In this chapter and Chapter 9 I discuss health-related questions prompted by the existence and experiences of trans people, again in the context of reflection on limits. I ask whether support for transition is indeed always the most appropriate response to gender-variant identity; I deal, too, with some ethical questions such as whether it is justifiable to undergo interventions that will compromise fertility and whether transition-related interventions may justly be prioritized when finances and resourcing for healthcare are scarce.",

In transition between childhood and adulthood, these are the years when all young people go through physical and psychological maturation, are expected to complete their education, acquire skills and assume a social identity that will enable them to fully participate in their communities and societies.While issues faced by youth with disability have often been defined in terms of medical concerns, it is now clearly recognised that disability is a cross-cutting issue and that it is often not medical but rather social, economic and human rights issues that are key barriers in the lives of these young people. For this reason, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD; UN, 2008) identifies persons with disabilities as individuals who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which, when combined with negative attitudes or environmental barriers, prevents them from taking a full and active role in society.",

      "abstract": "Although suicidality is frequently the cause of stigma, it is conversely true that stigma may be the cause of suicidality. The present paper focuses on the complex relationships that exist between suicidal behavior and stigmatizing attitudes.A narrative review of the topic will be presented on the basis of the relevant literature collected from an electronic search of PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases, using stigma, public stigma, structural stigma, perceived stigma, self-stigma, suicide, attempted suicide, and suicidality as key words.A negative perception is frequently held of suicidal people, labeling them as weak and unable to cope with their problems, or selfish. Individuals who have attempted suicide are subject to similar processes of stigmatization and \"social distancing\"; insurance policies include an exclusion clause against death by suicide. Subjects with a direct personal experience of depression or suicide strongly endorse a feeling of self-stigma; those who have attempted suicide are often ashamed and embarrassed by their behavior and tend to hide the occurrence as much as possible. Similar processes are observed among family members of subjects who have committed suicide or made a suicide attempt, with a higher perceived stigma present in those bereaved by suicide. Perceived or internalized stigma produced by mental or physical disorders, or through belonging to a minority group, may represent a significant risk factor for suicide, being severely distressing, reducing self-esteem and acting as a barrier in help-seeking behaviors.With the aim of preventing suicide, greater efforts should be made to combat the persisting stigmatizing attitudes displayed toward mental disorders and suicide itself. Indeed, the role of stigma as a risk factor for suicide should further motivate and spur more concerted efforts to combat public stigma and support those suffering from perceived or internalized stigma. Experts and scientific societies should form an alliance with the media in an effort to promote a marked change in the societal perception of mental health issues and suicide. As stigma may result in severe consequences, specialist care and psychological interventions should be provided to populations submitted to stigma.",

      "abstract": "Learning penetrates religion in many ways. Primary religious socialisation – sometimes referred to as religious nurture – is the process by which children are explicitly and purposefully taught to do things religiously or they learn implicitly by following what their families and other people around them do, speak and feel. In secondary religious socialisation one sets about learning something additional to or different from what was learned and internalised in one’s religious or non-religious childhood home and surroundings. Secondary socialisation may also entail processes of unlearning something previously learned in order to grasp and master the skills, ways of thinking and feeling, and discursive habits of the new worldview and context of life. Learning in both primary and secondary socialisation can in some cases turn into a thoroughly religiously informed way of life. Alternatively, religious learning may not always be sufficiently lengthy and committed to result in full socialisation. Many people engage in religion merely in special situations or turning points in life, and after that particular need is over, religion loses its acute significance. Furthermore, religious learning may also have intended or unintended effects and consequences beyond the more strictly bounded religious sphere and may come to be reflected in personal and relational life much more widely.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article we shall be analysing the representations of old age and ageing made by three generations of older women with different life stories (single, married, children and childless). Our principal findings, based on a qualitative analysis of 25 in-depth interviews conducted with three generations of older women (65–74, 75–84 and 85 and older), mainly reveal their reluctance and even refusal to define themselves as ‘older or elderly women’, largely due to persistent stereotypes linking old age to dependency, social isolation and fragility. Aware of the social prejudice regarding women and old age, they reject it unanimously. Older women represent a challenge to these homogenising preconceptions of old age, which they, on the contrary, experience in a multitude of ways, often enjoyable. Their conceptions of ‘ageing well’ are diverse and do not correspond to a clinical definition of ageing. Their representations of ‘ageing well’ and of ageing express positive values of autonomy, independence, consistency and integrity, maintenance of physical and intellectual health, and being socially active so they can ‘stay in the swing of things’, in the continuum of their lives and future projects, rather breaking with contemporary life or existing on the margins of society.",

      "abstract": "Sex offenses to children or young adolescents have become a growing public concern. Chemical castration is currently considered as the best available societal response to child sex abuse. It abolishes testosterone secretion, its effects are reversible and side effects are minor. It has been argued that offering convicted sex offenders with the possibility to be treated may be in contradiction with the bioethics principle of autonomy because the person has really no other choice -- the alternative is usually a lengthy confinement sentence. In view of this controversy, we explored lay people’s and physicians’ views regarding the acceptability of chemical castration. Fifty participants (among them five physicians) judged the acceptability of castration in each of 36 scenarios consisting of all combinations of four factors: aggressor’s age (21 vs. 41-year old); (b) victim(s)’ age (5, 8, or 14-year old); (c) aggressor’s psychiatric status (no psychiatric antecedents, suffers from sexual deviation, or recidivist); and (d) family’s attitude (hostile to any kind of castration vs. approve castration). Participants’ ratings of acceptability were, on the average, very high, and 68% of participants considered that chemical castration was fully justified in all the cases that were shown. A small minority (8%) considered that first time offenders of young adolescents, without psychiatric antecedents, should not be chemically castrated. Another minority position (24%) expressed doubts regarding chemical castration of first time offenders without antecedents but they never strongly opposed it. Implications for bioethics are discussed.",

The aetiology of marital relationships is very complex, and the factors involved operate at different levels. Social, cultural and economic influences all play an important part. In recent years there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of disturbances in human relationships as an essential factor in many of the obscure ills of individuals and of society. Increasing attention is being paid not only by doctors but by sociologists and social workers to the problems of intimate human relationships. Professional experience in the direct study of marriage and its problems has up to now been largely confined to that class of manifestly unhappy or 'unsatisfactory' marriage which either turns to, or is willing to be directed to, professional sources for help.",

Faktor genetik dapat ditunjang dengan faktor lingkungan yang kondusif. Pemberian stimulus yang intensif kepada anak akan berpengaruh besar terhadap perkembangan fisik motoriknya. Ketika faktor genetik unggul namun faktor lingkungan tidak mendukung, hal tersebut akan mempengaruhi keterlambatan perkembangan fisik motoriknya. Bayi yang lahir prematur juga akan mengalami keterlambatan perkembangan apabila lingkungannya tidak mendukung. Ketidakmatangan organ-organ juga mempengaruhi perkembangan fisik motoriknya. Pemberian stimulus kepada bayi prematur haruslah lebih intensif dibandingkan dengan anak normal. Hal tersebut tidak hanya perkembangan fisik motoriknya yang akan terhambat.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT People with a field‐dependent or field‐independent cognitive style are different in their interpersonal behavior in ways predicted from the theory of psychological differentiation. Field‐dependent people make greater use of external social referents, but only when the situation is ambiguous and these referents provide information that helps remove the ambiguity; field‐independent people function with greater autonomy from others under such conditions. Field‐dependent people are more attentive to social cues than field‐independent people. Field‐dependent people have an interpersonal orientation: they show strong interest in others, prefer to be physically close to people, are emotionally open and gravitate toward social situations. Field‐independent people have an impersonal orientation: they are not very interested in others, show both physical and psychological distancing from people and prefer nonsocial situations. Finally, field‐dependent and field‐independent people are different in an array of characteristics which make it likely that field‐dependent people will get along better with others. Altogether, field‐dependent people have a set of social skills that are less evident in field‐independent people. On the other hand, field‐independent people have greater skill in cognitive analysis and structuring. This pattern suggests that, with regard to value judgments, the field‐dependence‐independence dimension is bipolar; each of the contrasting cognitive styles has components adaptive to particular situations.",

Nonostante questo, il ruolo del diniego sul recidivismo criminale sessuale e controverso. I risultati della ricerca scientifica sono infatti concordi nel ritenere il diniego un bisogno di rispondenza, che incide sulla compliance al trattamento e che impatta sulla funzionalita relazionale e sociale della persona, ma che non acutizza il rischio di recidivisimo criminale. Se il diniego non e un fattore che direttamente influenza il rischio di ricaduta criminale, la convinzione giuridico-sociale, secondo cui l’assenza di diniego favo-risce un processo di assunzione di responsabilita, non e piu sostenibile ne sul piano scientifico ne tantomeno su quello psico-criminologico e clinico. Questi avanzamenti empirici richiedono un cambiamento di prospettiva rispetto al diniego iniziando a considerarlo un target del trattamento e non un elemento da eliminare prima di iniziare il trattamento. Probabilmente il sistema sociale potrebbe beneficiare maggiormente di una politica di intervento che conduca gli autori di reati sessuali a desistere, nonostante il processo di ammissione del reato e di assunzione di responsabilita seguira il cambiamento comportamentale piuttosto che anticiparlo.",

Last but not least, there is a risk for society when presuming that everything is feasible. However 'risk' does not only mean danger, it also implies the notion of venture and responsibility. Responsibility towards society consists in opposing wrong developments. Responsibility towards the disabled child is often a pretext for not being able to bear misery. Life has to be lived; each other concept is contrary to nature. The only justification for not running the risk of having a disabled child lies in the responsibility towards one's own family.

In this chapter, I argue against this view because it over-estimates the importance of declining death rates and underestimates that of adverse trends in a range of non-fatal, chronic health problems, both physical and mental. These problems have their sources in quite fundamental features of modern societies, and optimizing wellbeing will mean making correspondingly fundamental social and cultural changes. Young people reflect best the tenor and tempo of the times because they are growingup in them. Because of their stages of biological and social development, they are also most vulnerable to social risks. Many of the attitudes and behaviours – even the illnesses – that largely determine adult health have their origins in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. So the health of young people shapes the future health of the whole population: their health is not only important in its own right, or for their sake, it is crucial to assessing the overall state and fate of societies. I define health very broadly to include all aspects of wellbeing, not just clinical disease,disorder and disability. I use the terms 'health' and 'wellbeing' somewhat interchangeably and sometimes together to emphasize their many dimensions: illness and wellness, physical and psychological, objective and subjective. My focus, however, is on mental health and wellbeing; physical health is discussed elsewhere.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate an alternative view which suggests that particular kinds of stressful experiences (i.e., financial strain and the fear of crime) may actually promote greater isolation from others. The data reveal that chronic strain tends to promote distrust of others, and that distrust in turn leads to greater isolation from network members. However, the results further reveal that not all stressors are involved in this process. In particular, recent deaths are not related significantly to distrust or to social isolation. Finally, the data indicate that the process leading to less contact with others is more likely to involve older adults in lower social status positions. The impact of social isolation on depressive symptoms is also examined.",

Recent developments in the study of behaviors other than family violence, such as the use of addictive substances, suggest that common processes can be identified in the cessation of disparate behaviors involving diverse populations and occurring in different settings. Desistance is the outcome of processes that begin with aversive experiences leading to a decision to stop. Desistance apparently follows legal sanctions in nearly three spouse abuse cases in four, but the duration of cessation is unknown beyond short study periods. Batterers with shorter, less severe histories have a higher probability of desisting than batterers with longer, more severe histories. Victim-initiated strategies, including social and legal sanctions plus actions to create aversive experiences from abuse (e. g., divorce and loss of children) and social disclosure, also lead to desistance. Batterers are more resistant to change when they participate in social networks that support and reinforce violence to maintain family dominance. Desistance may also actually be displacement, where a violent spouse locates a new victim.",

They are less well nourished than men, less healthy, more vulnerable to physical violence and sexual abuse. They are much less likely than men to be literate, and still less likely to have preprofessional or technical education. Should they attempt to enter the workplace, they face greater obstacles, including intimidation from family or spouse, sex discrimination in hiring, and sexual harassment in the workplace – all, frequently, without effective legal recourse. Similar obstacles often impede their effective participation in political life. In many nations women are not full equals under the law: they do not have the same property rights as men, the same rights to make a contract, the same rights of association, mobility, and religious liberty. Burdened, often, with the “double day” of taxing employment and full responsibility for housework and child care, they lack opportunities for play and for the cultivation of their imaginative and cognitive faculties. All these factors take their toll on emotional well-being: women have fewer opportunities than men to live free from fear and to enjoy rewarding types of love – especially when, as often happens, they are married without choice in childhood and have no recourse from bad marriages. In all these ways, unequal social and political circumstances give women unequal human capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Ritu Sadana, ScDa Erik Blas, DrPHb Health inequalities are disparities in health, reflecting either differences in access to a range of promotional, preventive, curative, or palliative health services or differences in outcomes including disability, morbidity, and mortality spanning physical, mental, and social health. The causes of inequalities in health are dynamic and reflect multiple determinants. Health inequities, however, are differences in health that are judged to be avoidable, unfair, and unjust.1 Health inequities are often revealed through systematic patterns or gradients in access or outcomes across populations with different levels of underlying social advantage or disadvantage—that is, wealth, power, prestige, or other markers of social stratification.2 Numerous reviews across low-, middle-, and high-income countries continue to document that health inequalities are related not only to biological or genetic factors, but also to social factors that are amenable to policy and are potentially avoidable given cross-group or cross-population comparisons. Studies most often document differential access to health services based on an individual’s socioeconomic position or place of residence, rather than on need,3–6 although other approaches exist.7 The place in the social hierarchy that individuals and groups occupy, combined with the epidemiological environment, then determines exposure and vulnerability to health-enhancing or health-damaging conditions in daily life (e.g., where people are born, grow, live, work, and age).8 The underlying causes are complex, often reflecting systematic social, political, historical, economic, and environmental factors that also interface with biological factors. The term “social determinants” is often used as shorthand for all of these factors and is relevant to communicable and non-communicable conditions alike.9 An added complexity is that negative or positive impacts of social determinants of health (SDH) can be accumulated during a lifetime, alter health trajectories across the life course, and be transferred across generations.10 Moreover, labeling an inequality as an inequity also reflects a value judgment. This labeling is sometimes made explicit by deliberating on facts, clarifying underlying values, and designing remedial actions. Often, however, there is no",

      "title": "Alcohol use: social aspect, gender differences and stigmatization",
      "abstract": "Mental health and genderWhenever we speak about health, we should keep in mind that health is not only a biological state but state which entangles biology and culture. A number of illnesses, viewed in context of biological and cultural aspects, are socially constructed illnesses, and their development is directed by social attitudes and state policies [1]. Many social variables influence people's health. Sociologists talk about few positive and negative factors [2] and outline the following: quality of primary and secondary education, high education and employment opportunity, residential status, poverty, tobacco and alcohol use, diet quality, physical exercise. Stressful life events influence negatively both mental and physical health, especially if stressful events are continuous, but more so in people who are of lower socioeconomic background and with poorer resources [2].Studies have pointed that there are different relation between unemployment, gender and mental health. Unemployment and mental health, in opinion of some authors, should be related to other variables such as economical status, affliction to a class and ethnical group, marital status, age, lend of unemployment, previous unemployment experience Unemployed women have more psychical problems compared to men, according to some research findings while others speak contrary [3].Studies researching the link between unemployment and mental health in 804 women and 946 men from Sweden and in 488 women and 1011 men from Ireland have come to a conclusion that differing gender regimes in those two countries influence significantly the relation between the two variables. That is to say that unemployment in Ireland affects mental health of men more significantly then in Sweden where that influence is approximately the same on both sexes. Sweden is a country with high percentage of employment of women and it represents strong de-familization. context, unlike Ireland where the level of traditionally employed women is low as well as strong defamilization context. Income of women is of secondary importance and therefore psychosocial need and job responsibility lesser. In Ireland gender rolls differences are much wider and the female participation in labour market is not being supported therefore the unemployment level of women does not cause a lot of stress. Unemployment causes more stress and mental health suffering to men since they are expected to be the family providers. All of the above points to the social context as being of acute significance in regard to relation between gender, unemployment and mental health [3]. Since 1970s' researches have discussed if the increase of gender equality has decreased differences in alcohol consumption. Supposedly that reason for changes is greater employment of woman and liberalization of gender ideology. Apart from employment important are the changes of traditional family roles which have accordingly influenced the change of attitudes on men and women and influenced other aspects of social behaviour such as drinking [4]. Similarity in drinking patterns in man and women has induced fear in society that women will suffer health problems, productivity will decrease and family as institution will be damaged. Contrary to Convergence Hypothesis the modern research have found that greater number of women drinks similarly to man during the period of adolescents, but the drinking patterns defer during adult age [4]. According to this theoretical model man whose believes match the traditional male roles are in greater risk from consumption while women who accept conventional roles - traditionally female, drink less and vice versa.Some findings indicate that greater gender equality on overall level would influence better mental health of women. In USA, in countries with lower level of gender equality, higher is degree of morbidity and mortality, also, higher level of patriarchy is associated with higher mortality degree. …",

      "abstract": "Research has shown that political attitudes spring from diverse sources. This paper focuses on isolationism, a set of beliefs that can stem from social factors (e.g., economic deprivation, poor education, social or geographic isolation) and from psychological factors (e.g., n . aggression, inflexibility and low self-esteem). The purpose is not to demonstrate again that there is a connection between personality and political belief. Instead, the authors ask whether or not it matters if a political attitude—in the present case, isolationism—stems from personality influences rather than from some other sources, for example, education, group memberships, or ideology. Isolationists low in self-esteem are shown to differ from those high in self-esteem on a range of values and beliefs: liberalism-conservatism, extreme political values, and specific foreign policy questions. Thus, those who hold common beliefs on one set of issues are likely to differ in the opinions they hold on other political questions depending on whether they owe their convictions to their personality characteristics or to some other influence.",

Or, what may be desirable traits to engender and construct in a whole society? It is the latter question that I have chosen to answer, and hence I ask: insofar as we possess the techniques for systematically favoring or promoting in our descendants some traits and behaviors rather than others, ought we to do so, and in the interests of what ideals or goals? I am not concerned with picturing one ideal type of individual, but rather with describing traits that might be found scattered throughout a population; nor am I suggesting the desirability of any one individual possessing all of these traits, let alone that of every individual possessing them equally. The problem that I then confront turns out to be in part a political problem. For what we will be permitted to do to promote certain traits will not be determined",

The extreme of weakness, as giving up and giving in, which older adults applied to others, not themselves, prompted them to engage in several efforts at staying strong. These included motivating self-talk, achieving balance, keeping busy and active, and self-validating as a strong person. Older adults' perceptions of the association between weakness and ageing were variable and characterized by considerable ambiguity.Nurses must be alert to both the visible and subtler dimensions of weakness. It is important to engage older adults in active strategies that enhance muscle strength while capitalizing on their self-motivating and validating efforts at staying strong.",

      "abstract": "'Don't talk', 'don't trust', and 'don't feel', are the three cardinal rules which dominate households where addiction, abuse or other types of dysfunction are present. Growing up in this type of environment, children are likely to develop certain personality traits and behavioral patterns of survival. Low self esteem and deeply embedded feelings of shame may lead to alcoholism, drug abuse, other forms of dependency, and/or adult relationships marked by improvisation. Turning to the women in Australian women's prisons, one finds estimates that 80 to 85% are drug addicts, and a similar proportion are estimated to have been victims of incest or other types of abuse It is quite probable that a high percentage of the women in Australian prisons have grown up in families where the three cardinal rules operated. They are usually imprisoned for a crime related to their drug addiction. It is ironic that they are already in some respects socialized to prison life since the rules of 'don't talk', 'don't trust', and 'don't feel' are also principal values in the gaol culture. This article explores what these rules mean within the prison context and how they affect both the women inmates and the institutional environment. The research involved visiting eight women's prisons in Australia and interviewing 56 inmates.",

Moreover, adults show stable patterns in the degrees of concern they afford certain entities over others, yet it remains unknown when and how these patterns of moral decision-making manifest in development. Children aged 4 to 10 years (N = 151) placed 24 pictures of human, animal, and environmental entities on a stratified circle representing three levels of moral concern. Although younger and older children expressed similar overall levels of moral concern, older children demonstrated a more graded understanding of concern by including more entities within the outer reaches of their moral circles (i.e., they were less likely to view moral inclusion as a simple in vs. out binary decision). With age children extended greater concern to humans than other forms of life, and more concern to vulnerable groups, such as the sick and disabled. Notably, children's level of concern for human entities predicted their prosocial behavior. The current research provides novel insights into the development of our moral reasoning and its structure within childhood.",

Perhaps a reason for this has been the absence of a unified model of etiology and treatment that includes the most salient motivational factors unique to various subtypes of perpetrators. Such a model would have to be sufficiently flexible to account for the various sexually aggressive modes of expression without being unnecessarily complex or simplistic if it is to be clinically useful. Specifically with respect to sexual aggression against children, a quadripartite model is proposed that includes physiological sexual arousal, cognitions that justify sexual aggression, negative affective states, and personality problems as motivational precursors that increase the probability of sexually aggressive behavior. The relative prominence of these precursors is used as a guideline for assessing and treating particular subtypes of perpetrators. Failure to consider the primary motivational precursor during the initial stages of treatment also may account for the limited success of current treatments.",

Furthermore, multiple regression analysis was conducted to test if acculturation strategies and CQ also predicted adaptation. Cultural dissimilarity in terms of religion, familial structure, attitudes, beliefs and so on, hindered adaptation since greater cultural dissimilarity required higher degree of culture shedding and learning in the acculturation process.

      "title": "Physical performance in high school students: effect of chronotype",
      "abstract": "Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) is an individual characteristic, defined as chronotype. People are typically categorized in 3 different chronotypes: Morning, Evening and Neither types (M, E and N-types), which differ in the circadian rhythm of many physiological variables. M-types use to wake up and go to bed early and to have their best performances in the first part of the day, otherwise E-types go to bed and wake up late and they have the peak performances in the evening. The chronotype is influenced by both individual and environmental factors and gradually changes during human development. Many studies have demonstrated a trend beginning with a tendency toward morningness in children that gradually evolves into a shift toward eveningness. Approximately at the age of 20 years, this shift reaches its maximum and starts to decline, leading to a growing tendency toward morningness from midadulthood on. This more pronounced eveningness has been found to negatively affect adolescents’ sleep and daytime functioning; even physical performance of adolescents can vary throughout the day because sleep pressure increases, the input from the circadian timing system is optimal or non-optimal to perform the task or both of them. In this study participated 216 students, 124 males and 92 females, attending the first two high school classes (mean age 14-15 years). For the assessment of chronotype, all students compiled the Morningness-Eveningness Questionaire (MEQ), validated by Horne and Ostberg in 1976. For all subjects we collected anthropometric data (weight, height, BMI). All the subjects were categorized as M (n=22), N (n=165), and E-types (n=29). To assess the relationship between chronotype and physical performance, from the sample we recruited 51 subjects, 22 M-type (14 males and 8 females) and 29 E-types (18 males and 11 females), who carried out three Eurofit tests (SHR, Shuttle Run; SBJ, Standing Broad Jump; Cooper endurance test). Preliminary results, although showing some differences in physical performance between E and M chronotype, have not detected statistically significant differences between the two groups.",

According to retirement no longer focuses entirely on an event that occurs when one ends their primary working career, but it is now a stage of life and stage of human development that can extend beyond full-time work to part-time employment and the stoppage of work for pay. This research focuses on the withdrawal from full-time work and the factors that contribute to retireesa well-being in retirement. Retirement models, for the most part, have focused on financial resources such as income and personal assets. However there are other factors that shape retirement beyond finance and health benefits. The literature supports the need to amplify the focus of research to include more of what impacts peoples decisions to retire and their happiness after they retire. Researchers found what they called the happiness factor. They defined this factor as (a) the sense of control an individual has, (b) their social relationships, and (c) their financial status. Quality of life is another way to define the happiness factor, also called contentment. Happiness is realized quality of life: income, wealth, social status, or health measures of potential quality of life.",

      "title": "Gender incongruence: A longitudinal perspective from childhood throughout adolescence",
      "abstract": "Introduction Gender identity is each person’s internal and individual experience of gender. Gender expression is how a person publicly expresses their gender. Gender incongruence (GI) is defined as a condition in which a person has a marked incongruence between the expressed or experienced gender and the biological sex at birth. Adolescence is a crucial period for the persistence or development of GI, due hormonal changes, peer relations and first romantic experiences. Objectives To make a revision of the literature about GI along childhood throughout adolescence. Methods Research in the literature with the words “gender identity”, “gender incongruence”, “gender dysphoria”, “childhood” and “adolescence” in scientific databases. Results GI is present in a small percentage of children, often provoking psychopathological distress. There is a high prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in these children, compared with the general population. In most cases the dysphoria does not persist until adolescence. There has been an increasing number of adolescents seeking for treatment at gender identity services. The studies show that after the onset of puberty, the probability of persistent GI is high and that adolescents submitted to hormonal suppression tend to continue the medical treatment. Conclusions Epidemiological formal studies about gender incongruence in children and adolescents are very few. Studies of prevalence in these populations are community studies and don’t reflect the true prevalence of GI, so it would be necessary to investigate its prevalence and persistence in different world populations. It’s also necessary to make more prospective studies about the long-term effects of the medical treatment of GI. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Psychological human development generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood (age of majority). Adolescence is a transitional stage of physical, psychological and emotional development1, 2, 3. The period of adolescents is most closely associated with the teenage years 4, 5 though its physical, psychological and cultural experiences may begin earlier and end later. For example, although puberty has been historically associated with the onset of adolescents’ development 6 it rather typically begins prior to teenage years and there has been a normative shift of it occurring in pre-adolescence, particularly in female (precocious puberty)7 physical growth, as distinct from puberty (particularly in males), and cognitive development generally seen in adolescence, can also extend into the early twenties. Thus chronological age provides only rough marker of adolescence and the authors can say that reason may be attributed to less parental control and heightened desire to experiment and explore the unknown. This paper dwells upon multiple factors that are contributory to crime.",

      "abstract": "Sexual desire—the motivational component of human sexuality—is one of the most pervasive sexual responses that people experience during adolescence and adulthood. Many individual or personal factors are associated with desire, including demographic attributes (e.g., chronological age, gender), mental and physical health variables (e.g., chronic illness, mood disorders), and hormonal processes (e.g., testosterone levels). Interpersonal factors are also associated with sexual desire; both passionate love and overall relationship health (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, adjustment) are strongly linked with the amount of sexual desire that individuals feel for their partners. Reductions in sexual desire are common in most romantic relationships; however, sudden or sharp decreases may signal the development of an underlying interpersonal issue. Although less examined than other variables, sociocultural factors, including norms, stereotypes, laws, and religious doctrine, may also inhibit or facilitate the experience and expression of sexual desire.",

      "abstract": "In spite of the fact that masturbation involves almost all human beings in every culture, comparatively little has been written on the subject. Until very recently masturbation was defined in the medical literature as a sexual perversion and a damaging activity to be prohibited at all costs. In the beliefs of certain religious faiths masturbation is considered a sin. The evolution of masturbatory activity as observed from infancy through adolescence is presented. Masturbation can be understood as a \"discharge phenomenon\" undertaken to relieve a state of tension existing in the human body. As the child develops he is normally subjected to increased tensions due to restrictions and frustrations forced upon him by the family and culture. Being permitted no normal outlet, he resorts to the release he has known from infancy, and has the fantasy that certain forbidden or temporarily impossible wishes take place. The feelings of guilt, increased by parental attitudes, are associated with a fear of having damaged their sexual organs and a fear of consequent ill health. Excessive masturbation as defined, must be viewed as a symptom of the child's unhappiness or emotional instability. The role of the pediatrician is to explain ordinary masturbation to the parent as a normal physiologic function. When the physician is presented with the problem of a child with excessive masturbation he should attempt to detect factors responsible for an emotional upset.",

      "abstract": "Background While numerous cross sectional studies have addressed the topic of a possible “exercise addiction”, excessive exercise is not yet a form of behavioral addiction defined in the DSM V. There is debate about whether these patterns of exercise occur in isolation, or whether they always accompany other disorders; furthermore, there is virtually no evidence on the biological substrates of this condition. It must be noted that exercise is frequently a socially lauded behavior. Individuals who exercise excessively may therefore not have absorbed critical personal or societal feedback about their behavior, and be less conscious of its negative impact. This can pose a particular challenge in recruiting these individuals for studies which aim to provide insight into the nature of this disorder.",

      "abstract": "Utilizing an analytic autoethnography, I explore how previous life adversity affects the resilience of Black entrepreneurs under conditions of gentrification. I find that the extent of previous life adversity affects several aspects of the resilience process as well as multiple dimensions of resilience. While most Black entrepreneurs are likely to perceive racial discrimination, those with extensive prior exposure are more likely to be psychologically resilient since they are more likely to have coping mechanisms such as racial identity salience which prevent negative emotions from arising. However, racial identity salience also makes them less likely to adapt their business models to the new residents, so while they are more likely to be psychologically resilient, they are less likely to be financially resilient. Conversely, those with limited prior experience or exposure to racial discrimination are less likely to have previously developed coping mechanisms and have lower psychological resilience. Many do eventually recover psychologically by developing coping strategies such as identity hiding which help their psychological as well as financial resilience.",

Pomeni postavljanje posameznika v neenak položaj v primerjavi z drugimi osebami ali skupinami oseb. Gre za krsenje pravic do enakega obravnavanja, kar pa ima lahko negativen vpliv na zaposlene ter posledicno na delovno okolje, saj vpliva na pocutje, zdravje, samozavest, samopodobo in psihicni razvoj zaposlenih. Najpogosteje diskriminirane skupine zaposlenih so: istospolno usmerjeni, ženske, invalidi in eticne skupine. \r\n\r\nDiskriminacija na trgu dela se lahko pojavi že v samem procesu zaposlovanja ter nadalje, ko je oseba že zaposlena. Na trgu dela se lahko diskriminacija pojavi kot cista diskriminacija, poklicna segregacija in kot staticna diskriminacija. Na delovnem mestu pa se lahko pojavi v razlicnih oblikah, ki jih razvrstimo med prikrite in odkrite oblike diskriminacije. Prepoved kakrsne koli oblike diskriminacije je zapisana že v Ustavi Republike Slovenije ter nadalje v razlicnih zakonih, s katerimi država ureja varstvo državljanov. Upostevanje zakonodaje ima pomembno vlogo pri odpravi diskriminacije.\r\n\r\nV izrazito heteroseksualni družbi, prevzeti s heteronormativnimi predpostavkami, so lahko istospolno usmerjene osebe odrinjene na rob družbe. Osnovo za njihovo odrinjenost predstavljajo predsodki in stereotipi o istospolno usmerjenih osebah. Imajo lahko težave pri zaposlovanju, so izpostavljene sikaniranju na delovnem mestu ali nesramnemu in odklonilnemu odnosu sodelavcev. Posledica je nevidnost istospolno usmerjenih na delovnem mestu, ki je njihova lastna odlocitev in temelji na »varnosti v delovnem okolju«. Dosedanje opravljene raziskave, ki so zajele izkljucno istospolno usmerjeno populacijo v Sloveniji, kažejo, da jih 42 % ni razkritih na svojem delovnem mestu. \r\n\r\nSodobno podjetje sestavljajo zaposleni, ki so si med seboj razlicni. Osnova za raznolikost so razlicne osebne lastnosti posameznih zaposlenih. Sodobni management mora prepoznati pomembnosti in koristi raznolikosti. Sodobni managerji se zavedajo, da lahko ucinkovito upravljanje raznolikosti zaposlenih poveca ucinkovitost delovanja podjetja, pripomore k lažjemu doseganju zastavljenih ciljev, dviguje zadovoljstvo zaposlenih, daje zaposlenim obcutek varnosti in pripadnosti podjetju. Prav tako pa zadovoljni zaposleni lažje sprejemajo »drugacnost« svojih sodelavcev in s tem pripomorejo k boljsim odnosom in visji ucinkovitosti. \r\n\r\nV magistrski nalogi je bila opravljena raziskava, s katero smo ugotavljali, kaksen je odnos do homoseksualnosti glede na spol zaposlenih. Prav tako smo proucevali, ali obstaja povezava med stopnjo zadovoljstva z življenjem in odnosom do homoseksualnosti, ali je starost zaposlenih povezana z njihovim odnosom do homoseksualnosti, ali obstaja razlika v zadovoljstvu z življenjem in statusom zaposlitve.",

      "title": "Real World High-Risk Patterns Associated with Internet Addictive Behaviors",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe use of the concept of risk has been primarily biomedical, reflecting a concern for adverse outcomes related to morbidity and mortality. The epidemiological research has concentrated to locate agents or conditions that are associated with an increased probability of outcomes that compromise health, quality of life, or life itself. More recently the concept has expanded into the domain of behavior, underlying the importance of high-risk behavior patterns in the development or deterioration of clinical disorders and illnesses.Overall the empirical evidence supports the existence of organized patterns of adolescent risk behaviors. These patterns taken together probably reflect an adolescent's way of being in the world. Their organization raises questions about the origin or source of the covariation and patterning. The answer probably lays part in the social ecology of adolescent life, an ecology that provides socially organized opportunities to learn risk behavior together and normative expectations and part in the fact that different risk behaviors can serve the same functions. Considerable research has shown that adolescent risk behaviors are functional, purposive, instrumental and goal- directed and that these goals are often central to normal adolescent development. Smoking, drinking, illicit drug use, risky driving or early sexual activity can be instrumental in gaining peer acceptance and respect; in establishing autonomy from parents; in repudiating the norms and values of conventional authority; in coping with anxiety, frustration and anticipation of failure or in affirming maturity and marking a transition out of childhood and toward a more adult status (1).Internet addiction is a newly emerged behavior problem in adolescents and it is proposed to be included to previously defined behavioral problems. According to problem behavior theory1, use of alcohol, smoking, and illicit substance use, have been grouped as problem behaviors, which have the same psychosocial proneness including the variables of social environment, perceived environment, personality, and behavior. These variables serve either as instigations for engaging in problem behavior or controls against involvement on problem behaviour. It is suggested that the balance between instigations and controls determines the degree of proneness for problem behaviour. The overall level of proneness reflects the degree of psychosocial conventionality- unconventionality characterised each adolescent.The concepts that constitute the perceived- environment system include social controls, models, and support. Problem behavior proneness in the perceived environment system includes low parental disapproval of problem behavior, high peer approval of problem behavior, high peer models for problem behavior, low parental controls and support, low peer controls, low compatibility between parent and peer expectations, and low parent (relative to peer) influence.The concepts that constitute the personality system include a patterned and interrelated set of relatively enduring, sociocognitive variables-values, expectations, beliefs, attitudes, and orientations toward self and society-that reflect social learning and developmental experience. Problem behavior proneness in the personality system includes lower value on academic achievement, higher value on independence, greater social criticism, higher alienation, lower self-esteem, greater attitudinal tolerance of deviance, and lower religiosity.The concepts that constitute the behavior system include both problem behaviors and conventional behaviors. Problem behaviors include alcohol use, problem drinking, cigarette smoking, marijuana use, other illicit drug use, general deviant behavior (delinquent behaviors and other norm-violative acts), risky driving, and precocious sexual intercourse. Involvement in any one problem behavior increases the likelihood of involvement in other problem behaviors due to their linkages in the social ecology of youth-with socially organized opportunities to learn and to practice them together-and to the similar psychological meanings and functions the behaviors may have. …",

There is nothing to match the early psychology experiments where subjects were often swayed by the behaviour of others to an extraordinary degree, but there is plenty of evidence of conformism. This seems built-in to our sociality either because we have preferences for conversation or status which are activated by the knowledge of what others do, or because other people face relevantly similar decisions to our own and so that their behaviour signals something useful to us about the uncertain world. These social influences can cause mischief. The more worrying cases, however, are those where individual preferences themselves change through interaction with others: the strongest experimental evidence for this is with respect to individual social preferences, particularly in a context where individuals belong to different groups.",

      "abstract": "Why do people resist evidence that challenges the validity of long–held beliefs? And why do they persist in maladaptive behavior even when persuasive information or personal experience recommends change? We argue that such defensive tendencies are driven, in large part, by a fundamental motivation to protect the perceived worth and integrity of the self. Studies of social–political debate, health–risk assessment, and responses to team victory or defeat have shown that people respond to information in a less defensive and more open–minded manner when their self–worth is buttressed by an affirmation of an alternative source of identity. Self–affirmed individuals are more likely to accept information that they would otherwise view as threatening, and subsequently to change their beliefs and even their behavior in a desirable fashion. Defensive biases have an adaptive function for maintaining self–worth, but maladaptive consequences for promoting change and reducing social conflict.",

Most services for victims of domestic violence are organized, either explicitly or implicitly, around the goal of relationship termination. More needs to be done to serve women, because of religious, spiritual, or moral reasons, who believe and are told by family and community that relationship termination is a dishonorable option. More also needs to be done to recognize the wide array of protective strategies that women can obtain by reaching out to faith-based organizations.",

      "abstract": "Cases of pedophilia crimes are widely heard in the news. Pedophilia is a sexual disorder that has the desire to have sex with children under the age of 13. In addition to having sex, other pedophiles are satisfied by watching child pornography which is spread on prohibited sites and joining sexual deviation groups to make video calls for sex. If they do not have direct sexual intercourse, the pedophile can satisfy his lust by interacting online with the victim in the form of erotic chat, sending pictures and videos, and audio that triggers sexual arousal. The object of pedophilia itself is minors and does not look at gender. The type of research used in this article is normative by utilizing laws, pedophilia books, and mass media in the form of articles. Research data shows that there is confusion in convicting a pedophile. This is because pedophilia can be classified as a mental disorder, psychological condition, or more towards sexual orientation. This deviant behavior will certainly damage the growth and development of a child as a future generation. This deviant behavior must be stopped. When the perpetrator begins to realize there is a sexual disorder, the perpetrator must consult his condition to a psychologist. If this deviant act damages and harms other people, the perpetrator must undergo severe sanctions. Because the perpetrator takes the opportunity to deceive and damage someone's morale.",

      "title": "Comparative study of Suicide Attempters with and withoutPersonality Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nSuicide's history goes back at least to man's earliest written records.\r\nThere are many perspectives from which we can view suicide - historical,\r\nSociological, biological, psychological etc. These perspectives not just\r\nInfluence the way we see suicide and suicidal attempts, but also the\r\nEfforts at suicide prevention.\r\nSuicide is a serious public health problem. There have been\r\nDramatic and disturbing increases in suicide among youths. The study of\r\nSuicide risk and protective factors and their interaction form the empirical\r\nBase for suicide prevention. Understanding risk factors can help dispel the\r\nMyth that suicide is a random act or result from stress alone.\r\nRisk factors for completed suicide include male gender, extremes\r\nOf age, prior suicide attempts, family history of attempts, psychiatric\r\nDisorders - Axis I and Axis II diagnosis, substance dependence, adverse\r\nLife experiences and other social factors.\r\nSuicide completions and suicide attempts can be seen as\r\nRepresenting two distinct yet overlapping populations. Books describe a\r\nTypical suicide completer as a male with Axis I diagnosis of depressive\r\nDisorder with comorbid substance dependence. A typical suicide\r\nAttempter is a young female with Axis II disorders such as borderline,\r\nNarcissistic, or histrionic personality disorder. Those who have made an\r\nAttempt of low lethality are often treated dismissively as attention seekers.\r\nBut, the fact that, at the very least, such individuals are the victims of\r\nInadequate coping styles often is ignored. Between 8 to 10 percent of\r\nThose making an attempt will ultimately kill themselves. Suicide attempts\r\nRemain the single most important predictor of subsequent death by suicide\r\nOf all (WHO, 2002).\r\nSuicidal behaviour covers the whole range from suicidal thoughts,\r\nTo attempted suicide and completed suicide. Considering suicide as a\r\nSpectrum stretching from ideas and fantasies, wishes, acts to completions,\r\nStudying suicide attempters will give data that can be extrapolated to\r\nCompleters, keeping in mind that there can be significant differences.\r\nSuicide attempts can be up to 10 - 40 times frequent than completed\r\nSuicides in certain places (WHO, 2002). This indicates an enormous\r\nAmount of morbidity and burden.\r\nAccording to WHO/EURO multi-centre study on Para suicide,\r\nSuicide attempt is defined as An act with non fatal outcome in which an\r\nIndividual deliberately initiates a non habitual behavior, that without\r\nIntervention from others will cause self harm, (or) deliberately ingests a\r\nSubstance in excess of the prescribed (or) generally recognized dosage,\r\nAnd which is aimed at realizing changes that the person desires via the\r\nActual (or) expected physical consequences.\r\nPersonality Disorders:\r\nThe understanding of personality and its disorders is what\r\nDistinguishes psychiatry fundamentally from all other branches of\r\nMedicine. Personality disorders (pds) are common conditions in\r\nContemporary society. Pds occur in 10 to 20 percent of the general\r\nPopulation and in about half of psychiatric inpatients or outpatients.\r\nThe relevance of Personality Disorders in suicide completions has\r\nBeen evaluated by many studies (Cheng et al, 1997; Foster et al 1999;\r\nHenrikkson et al 1993; Foster et al 1997). Their relevance in suicide\r\nAttempts has been brought out by other studies (Suominen et al 1996;\r\nHawton et al 2003).\r\nAmong Indian studies, the rate of personality disorders in subjects\r\nWho have demonstrated acts of self-harm have varied from 7 %\r\n(Chandrasekaran et al, 2003) to 64 % (Nath et al, 2008). Sethi et al, 1978\r\nFound a rate of 47.8 % and Gupta et al, 1981 a rate of 62.2 % of\r\nPersonality disorders among suicide attempters.\r\nHowever, few studies have attempted to evaluate the characteristics\r\nOf suicide attempters with personality disorders and to study if there are\r\nMajor differences with those without personality disorders. Studying the\r\nDifferences would assist the management of these patients. This study is\r\nAn attempt in that direction.",

      "title": "A Socio- Religious Perspective of Late Marriage and Stigmatization of Single Adults and its Impact on the Church in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "Late marriage among adult youths is one of the challenges in the church in Nigeria. It affects the image of the church and the spiritual growth of the people concerned. Many of the youths marry at late thirties to late forties.Late marriage here refers to situations when aperson who hasreach the state of maturity in every facet of life that is; mentally, spiritually, financially and physically is not married probably as a result of unavailability of spouse or some other factors. Although there are a few who deliberately choose to delay their marriage probably because of academic, career or ministerial pursuit but majority of those who are having late marriage are not prepared for it. They have their life planned out only to find it difficult to settle into blissful home.Many of those with delay marriage are being mocked by their relatives and peers; many times they are seen as people with peculiar problem. The church also treated them sometime as people who have spiritual problem or are not spiritual enough to pray through and get answer in the area of marriage. Sometimes their case is termed demonic and they are stigmatized. This attitude discouraged many adult singles, particularly the females, and made them feel not welcome in the Church. The loneliness and the temptation the matured singles face in their various offices are beyond imagination: the harassment of bosses, insult from colleagues and ungodly proposals from ridiculous quarters coupled with fellow Christians teasing them that ‘how is bro?’ when it is obvious that the fellow is not into any relationship is like putting salt in a sore. The paper attempts to examine the causes of late marriage, the socio-religious perspective of marriage among the Yoruba, stigmatization of female single adults and the impact of these on the Church, using the descriptive and socio-historical approach. Findings showed that many go into marriage to satisfy social and religious expectations not necessarily because it was the best thing for them as at the time they married. It becomes necessary to re-orientate the youths on the need to make necessary preparations before marriage and see marriage as a gift from God. Most important is the fact that late marriage or no marriage at all does not make one less human or less intelligent.",

Sexual disgust can also be conceptualized from a relational perspective that draws on oedipal psychodynamics as well as recent research on disgust as a form of embodied moral cognition. From a subjective viewpoint, sexual disgust is self-affirming, as it preserves the purity, sanctity, and desirability of the self in the face of polluting sexual contact. Yet from an other-centered viewpoint, sexual disgust precludes empathic recognition when it shames the object of sexual disgust and rationalizes its mistreatment. This dialectic of assertion (i.e., refusal to submit to something sexually disgusting) and recognition (i.e., affirmation as an object of sexual desire) plays out in adult romantic relationships when one partner’s sexual delight is the other partner’s sexual disgust.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rejection sensitivity is the disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection by significant others. A model of the role of this disposition in male violence toward romantic partners is proposed. Specifically, it is proposed that rejection sensitivity is a vulnerability factor for two distinct maladaptive styles of coping with intimate relationships. Rejection‐sensitive men may attempt to prevent anticipated rejection by reducing their investment in intimate relationships. Alternatively, they may become highly invested in intimate relationships in search of an unconditionally supportive partner. Their low threshold for perceiving and overreacting to rejection, however, heightens their risk of responding aggressively to their partners’negative or ambiguous behavior. Cross‐sectional data from 217 male college students supported predictions derived from the model. Among college men who reported relatively high investment in romantic relationships, anxious expectations of rejection predicted dating violence. Among men who reported relatively low investment in romantic relationships, anxious expectations of rejection predicted reduced involvement in discretionary close relationships with friends and romantic partners and, more generally, increased distress in and avoidance of social situations.",

Prostitution laws in some form can be justified as reducing these harms. The claim that prostitution is harmful only because it is stigmatized and the claim that it is stigmatized only because it is illegal are considered and rejected. Four kinds of policy are distinguished: prohibition, abolition, regulation, and full decriminalization. Although prohibition probably cannot be justified by the paternalistic argument, abolition or regulation in some form probably can be.",

Apart from studies of the biological determinants of perimenopausal symptoms, they have also examined the contribution of various psychosocial factors in their occurrence and severity. Although menopausal symptoms are primarily considered to be a result of the sometimes intense hormonal fluctuations that are experienced during perimenopause, this does not necessarily exclude the role of psychosocial factors such as demographic characteristics, cultural or ethnic background, attitudes toward menopause, specific lifestyles and habits, specific previous life experiences and personality traits. A review of recent research findings and contributions of these psychosocial factors in the development of perimenopausal symptoms engaged will be presented in this work. Studies have clearly shown that certain psychosocial factors contribute to the occurrence and severity of symptoms or increased risk for perimenopausal symptoms, including the risk for major disturbances, such as clinical depression.",

Yet some might also see this relationship in energetic terms: as exciting, lively, passionate, or fun. An online survey asked 871 U.S. adults who believed in God to reflect on a recent positive life event. Three measures assessed relational energy or excitement: a slider item, a Likert item, and a set of eight adjectives. Regressions consistently showed that even when controlling for perceived love and safety in the relationship, this energy/excitement dimension predicted more gratitude to God, more divine attributions and gift appraisals for the event, feeling more loved by God, and greater desires to pass on kindness to others. The predictive role of energy/excitement was not reducible to religiousness, God belief, state or trait gratitude, trait gratitude to God, feeling energized, subjective vitality, or social desirability.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines drug dealing and gang membership, and to a lesser extent sex offending and homicide, with respect to age of onset and desistance, correlates and causes, and offense specialization and persistence during the transition from adolescence into young adulthood. Prior studies and research indicate that initiation of criminal activity is not rigidly fixed in enduring biological or developmental processes, but is contingent on crime type, time period, and perhaps other features of social context. Although most criminal offending begins in adolescence, the chapter finds some evidence of initiation of serious violence and drug dealing in early adulthood, whereas gang membership almost always begins during adolescence. The chapter's analyses also indicate comparatively strong persistence from adolescence into young adulthood of drug dealing and gun carrying, less persistence in serious violence and theft, and little persistence in gang involvement. In general, the evidence suggests that special types of offenders do not tend to specialize in a single offense type to the exclusion of others, although prior research does indicate somewhat greater specialization among sex offenders who victimize children than those who victimize peers or adults. Additional research is needed to formulate effective interventions for these special offenders.",

      "abstract": "The idea that people who identify as transgender or outside the gender binary are not interested in becoming parents has been refuted by several studies. However, both medical unknowns and cis-gendered normativity surround the process of becoming a parent for people identifying as transgender or outside of the gender binary, with little known about the psychosocial impact on the family formation dilemmas of transgender and gender nonconforming adults. Employing Life Course Theory as our theoretical framework, three focus group interviews were conducted with eleven adults who identified as transgender or outside the gender binary. Qualitative data analysis of the focus group interview transcripts was conducted through Thematic Analysis. Three main themes were identified concerning the dilemmas perceived by the nine participants who contemplated future parenthood: (i) Planning to become a parent -- \"but am I ready for the big responsibility?\"; (ii) who I am doesn't fit into the cis-gender system of accessing fostering, adoption or fertility services; (iii) my quest for a non-binary or gender appropriate self and the need for flexible future planning centered on reproductive capacity. Overall, thoughts about gender transition were often interwoven with parenthood plans and in a reciprocal fashion the desire and intention to have, or not have, children was implicated in satisfaction with gender transition. The significance of these themes is discussed in relation to how hopes for parenthood could be realized without jeopardizing gender identity and the need for a future focused, flexible, and open-minded approach on the part of fertility and adoption services.",

      "abstract": "When I first started reading the psychological literature on homosexuality nearly 25 years ago, several omissions were painfully evident.On the positive side, studies were no longer focusing on whether or not lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were mentally disordered; their minds had been rescued from psychopathology with the 1973 removal of homosexuality from the official list of mental disorders.However, the literature I read about 'homosexuals' described people who seemed to spring from nowhere, that is, they were never children or adolescents, and did not seem to have siblings, parents, or grandparents.Nothing in the literature at the time alluded to long-term relationships, or even important friendships.The implicit portrait was of an adult homosexual person, almost always a male, living in a metropolitan area on his own (although having sex on a regular basis -this was not left out!).Although they now had their mental health restored, they still did not have lives.In essence, what was missing was any focus on their development -over their lifetimes in relationship to others, in distinct social circumstances, and at particular historical moments.For example, in the early 1980s, there were no lesbian or gay adolescents in the professional literature.The gerontological literature did not contain older adults who were lesbian or gay.Research on families did not include samesex couples or lesbian, gay, or bisexual parents.Helping to finish this fractured portrait was the problematic methodology used in early studies.Although samples were no longer drawn from clinical settings, researchers used small samples found in a limited set of urban gay venues, and were conducted with a model of sexual orientation that had two boxes, gay or heterosexual.(The bisexual box was added later, and the transgendered person -a new gender -would not appear in the psychological literature until the 21st century.)The psychological findings were decontextualized.Research never included such profoundly important factors as the widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation that sealed many in their 'closets,' the harassment and violence that made fear a normative aspect of daily existence, nor even the fact that their private sexual behavior was illegal in most parts of the country.It was remarkable to me that researchers could make generalizations.",

      "title": "Stereotypes of older adults Do they influence suicide",
      "abstract": "Many countries are experiencing unprecedented increases in the number of older adults in their population. In Australia, the fastest-growing segment of the population is of those over 85 years of age. The high suicide rate of older adults receives less public notice than rates among younger adults. I argue that at least some of the public attitudes toward suicide by older adults arise from some stereotypes of older adults as helpless and demented. While the range of factors influencing the decision to suicide is as broad as at other ages, there are aspects that may be specific to current cohorts of older adults. The first is the adoption of negative stereotypes as self-stereotypes of helplessness and cognitive impairment. The second is the issue of the stigma of having a mental health problem and of receiving treatment for such problems. Self:stereotypes of helplessness decrease the likelihood of recognition of problems such as depression. The reduction in the likelihood of treatment due to helplessness combines with stigma to further reduce the likelihood of engaging in treatment. Promotion of positive social engagement and the recognition of depression and related disorders can help overcome the negative stereotypes and reduce the suicide rate.",

      "abstract": "The litany of social dysfunction is now familiar. The rates of violent crime are higher than they have ever been: Americans kill and maim one another at per-capita rates an order of magnitude higher than other industrialized nations. The rate of marriage has been generally declining and the rate of illegitimacy hits new highs each year. Tens of thousands of children have no fathers and no family member or close acquaintance who has a regular job. This pattern is now repeating into a second and third generation. Illiteracy is becoming a problem and schools have so lost authority that the accepted response to armed pupils is to install metal detectors. Senator Moynihan in a celebrated article recently pointed out how we cope with social disintegration by redefining deviancy, so that crimes become “normal” behavior. How did we arrive at this condition? There’s no short answer, but I have come increasingly to believe that my own profession – psychology –bears a large part of the blame. The story began many years ago, when psychology defined itself as a science. By thus anointing itself, psychology gained great prestige. People accepted with little demur prescriptions that would earlier have been condemned on moral grounds. Don’t spank your child. Don’t attempt to deter sexual exploration by young people – deterrence is probably bad and will certainly fail. Punishment is ineffective and should be replaced by positive reinforcement. Self-esteem is good, social stigma bad. It is not clear that this advice was all wrong. What is clear, and what I will show in this article, is that it was not based on science. Some questions about behavior can be answered – either now or in the future – through",

Sexual orientation milestones and events related to youths' childhood gender atypicality were examined and compared to current self-esteem and internalized homophobia. Three-quarters felt different from other youth as they were growing up. Two-thirds were considered gender atypical by others, at about age 8. Over half reported that their parents considered them gender atypical, and half of these parents tried to change youths' behavior. Self-rated childhood gender atypicality was strongly associated with participants' reports of others' perception of their gender atypicality as well as the youths' current self-evaluated gender atypicality. Neither childhood nor current gender atypicality was related to current self-esteem or internalized homophobia.",

      "abstract": "The fascination wayward for ways every of youth age, perhaps have held because great fascination for every a e, perhaps ecause emergence into adulthood is considered a test of a society's success in socializing its young to its ways. Deviance, therefore, is watched anxiously as an indicator of the integrity of the system. Rapid change in the basic institutions responsible for socialization, the family in particular, make it likely that, many young persons will slip anchor. This seems to be the case in postwar American society. Stuffed juvenile court dockets, jammed jails and detention centers, and widespread fear of young people, particularly by the elderly, suggest that deviance among young persons has escalated. On the other hand, the same conditions that lead youth to defy accepted forms of behavior may also release energy and talent toward ends that are generally regarded as constructive even if sometimes they are unappreciated. Moreover, it should be recognized that deviance among the young is not necessarily a result of inner directed revolt, rebellion, release or defection but often is stimulated by others, adults included. An obvious case in point is the recruitment of juveniles into the drug trade to handle transactions at points of maximum vulnerability because of their greater immunity from prosecution. Indeed, the exploitation of the young has a long history. More subtle and pervasive influences on the young are the behavioral models provided by adults. If the stuff of high romance, adventure, and heroism for adults involves, among other lifestyle paraphernalia, smoking, sex, and intoxication, adults should not expect young people to be socialized in a contrary direction. Successful socialization in all societies is anticipatory; it builds consistently toward an adult model of behavior that is a fulfillment of earlier learning. The view being propounded here is a simple",

Nonretarded children's expressions were identified more accurately than were those of retarded children. Happiness was recognized best.

In the voluminous literature of youth problems this one gets rather frequent mention. Evidence points to the fact that when parent-child relationships are out of adjustment when there is delinquency when there is severe and immature dependency or when there is open quarreling something is wrong in the lines of communication between the generations. All human relationships are fundamentally acts of communication. All human behavior is motivated by needs of the complex organism that is the person. No two people exist in the same social setting without some relationship activities. It is especially clear that a parent and child do behave so that fundamental needs are met. The activities or relating are for the most part overt pieces of business; they are visible and audible. Relationships are produced and maintained by signals no matter what motivates them. In infancy the child must develop his relationships through smiles random motions cooing sounds or varied squawks. By the time he reaches his teens he will have adopted the family language as his principal means of relating to other human beings. The problem of communication between teen-agers and parents is not crucial for teen-agers alone. When relationships are damaged oldsters are seriously hurt also. Whole households can be made miserable--if not whole communities. (excerpt)",

Stigma occurs due to ignorance, prejudice and discrimination, and the level of fear and ignorance are directly related to the severity of stigmatization. The main issues when it comes to stigma are how to remove the stigma or a mark from the individual so that society can accept him back into the community and how to avoid self-stigmatizing the individual and creating his bad self image. To answer these questions, we need to understand why and how the stigma of mentally ill persons arises, to consider the sociodemographic characteristics of the environment as predictors of attitudes toward persons with mental illness, to see how stigma affects the affected person, his family, environment, but also the psychiatric profession itself, and finally, to see what are the conditions of legal protection for people with psychiatric illness. The stigma itself cannot be eradicated, but we can work to reduce it and prevent it in order to improve the status of mentally ill persons in society and the community and their faster and better rehabilitation",

      "abstract": "We first seek to explore the relationship between attachment styles of professional financial service customers and their ability to experience customer satisfaction and build relationships with a commercial bank. Secure attached people identify with the commercial bank, feel satisfied and are loyal with the commercial bank. Second, we question whether attachment styles and degrees of satisfaction are also reflected in a capacity to feel pleasure in attachments to luxury products, feel happiness and pro-activeness, develop positive relationships with others, and sleep well for multiple samples of non-commercial customers. Apparently, secure attached people form enjoyable attachments with luxury goods/brands. Equally, in life in general they show a proactive attitude and generosity toward others, and feel low envy. Anxious attachment style relates negatively with appraisal of and relationship formation with commercial banks, negatively with enjoyment and attachment to luxury goods, and negatively with generosity towards people and happiness. In addition, anxious attachment style relates positively with envy towards people and low sleep quality. Avoidant attachment style does not relate with any of the above variables except for a negative association with happiness with life in general. Finally, none of the attachment styles scales relates with the BIS-BAS scale, except that anxious attachment relates with the BIS scale, indicating largely that the attachment system does not function as an approach-avoidance system but helps in homeostatic regulation of stress due to the experience of quiescence with others. By studying how attachment styles affect people in commercial and general social domains we hope to pave the way for further exploration of the fundamental mechanisms that drive secure attached people as opposed to insecure attached people to generally experience positive emotions and outcomes in life. We tentatively suggest that compared to insecure attached people, secure attached people possess a different “style of being in the social world.”",

      "abstract": "Summary Intoxication and drunken behavior are related but not identical phenomena. Certain biological, psychomotor and psychological effects define intoxication. On the other hand, drunken behavior is to a great extent culturally defined and is related to variables such as time, place, environmental cues, social atmosphere, role expectations, attitudes and psychological needs. A common denominator for both is alcohol imbibition. The behavior of an intoxicated alcoholic does not have to be drunken. In support of this position, a case is presented showing that an alcoholic–whose drinking behavior is characteristically maladaptive–was able to display socially integrative behavior while exposed to substantial amounts of alcohol. This finding was not fortuitous. Twenty‐nine other alcoholics received alcohol according to a two‐day drinking schedule. The men initiated and stopped drinking on request and did not display provocative behavior while drinking. The study demonstrates that it is possible to initiate and easily terminate periods of drinking in alcoholics. This may represent a first step in the process of teaching alcoholics to drink without exhibiting socially disruptive behavior.",

In fact, estimates from various wars over the past 70 years suggest that noncombatants comprise the majority of casualties. For survivors, war's effects are often embodied, leaving long-term effects on health and biology. Some of these effects, such as injuries and psychological trauma, are well known. Yet other effects may be subtle and may be elucidated by a developmental biological perspective. In early life, when growth rates are highest, conditions of war may have their greatest impact. Depending on local circumstances, a developing embryo, infant, or child growing in a place embroiled in armed conflict is likely to face—directly or indirectly—various stressors, including malnutrition, infectious disease, and/or psychological stress. Thus, the conditions of war and forced displacement may become embodied, getting under the skin for fundamental biological reasons.",

      "title": "Mind the gender gap: The social neuroscience of belonging",
      "abstract": "Gender gaps persist in the 21st century, in many aspects of society and in many types of organisation. There are earnings gaps in almost all domains, reports of glass ceilings and the “missing middle” in business, finance, law and politics, and dramatic under-representation of women in many branches of science, even in the most “gender equal” countries. This is despite decades of effort to address them, including targeted legislation and many Diversity and Inclusion initiatives. Early essentialist, competence-based explanations for the existence of gender gaps have been largely discredited at the research level, although their persistence in the public consciousness and at the level of education and training can still negatively bias both individual self-belief and organisational processes. Contemporary essentialist explanations are now emerging, with claims that such gaps are the manifestations of the presence or absence of endogenous, brain-based characteristics underpinning career progression or career preferences. The focus remains on the individual as the source of gender imbalances. Less attention has been paid to the contextual aspects of organisations where gender gaps are evident, to inclusion (or the lack of it), or the availability of unbiased reward and progression pathways. Advances in 21st century social cognitive neuroscience are revealing the importance of external organisational processes as powerful brain-changing forces, with their potentially negative impact on self-belief and a sense of belonging. Key research is demonstrating the cortical and behavioural consequences of negative social experiences, with the activation of core inhibitory pathways associated with low self-esteem, lack of engagement, and eventual withdrawal. This paper will argue that reference to such research will provide better explanations for the persistence of gender gaps, and offer evidence-based insights into addressing gender gap issues. Importantly, this is not a rejection of an endogenous, brain-based explanation for gender gaps but the elaboration of a better-informed 21st century model, flagging up the need to take factors such as cultural stereotyping and organisational bias into account in any drive toward true gender equity, or genuinely levelled playing fields.",

A critical reappraisal of the evidence suggests a more balanced view of the mother-child relationship should be taken. A classification of the condition, founded on facts not concepts, is urgently required. Non-organic failure to thrive should be viewed in a multidimensional context, in which potential influences upon the symptomatic infant are considered. Inadequacy of nutrition is caused by both a failure of adequate provision of food and by inadequate intake. A vicious circle of maladaptive behavioural interaction between caregiver and infant is often present, sustained by high emotional tensions. Clinical intervention should aim to clarify the contributions made by both caregiver and infant to that interaction and thus break the cycle. The basis on which intervention is made should be direct observation of the parent and child relationship in as many different environmental contexts as feasible, especially during feeding. The multidisciplinary team has an important role to play in management. An emphasis on parental culpability in the aetiology of non-organic failure to thrive, in the absence of direct evidence of neglect, is wrong.",

The protagonist's troublesome and painful separation from his wife taking place during a trip through the United States is interpreted as an attachment-conflict towards the mother that has not been dissolved during late adolescence. The essential characteristic of late adolescence is taking one's final leave from the infantile and adolescent parental imagines and the reapproachment to the real parents. In case of a failure late adolescence may easily lead to a syndrome of rejection or of overadjustment or of drop-out-identity. Especially in the rejection or in the drop-out-identity one can find object-relationships resembling those found in narcicistic or borderline-disorders. In many cases these adolescents lack the transitional scope they would have needed to find their way to autonomy or to the ability of containing (BION).",

      "abstract": "Participation in sport, in particular intensive elite sport may be associated with shorter and longer term risks to health. Elite sport participation might also be associated with a narrow focus, to the detriment of developing in other ways, perhaps with regard to friendships or education. This paper explores the issues surrounding prudence and sport. It begins by examining two central aspects of the rationale for prudential engagement with sport and physical activity. (1) The contention that each stage of life counts equally in assessing well-being over a life; and (2) The need to detach from present concerns and commitments to maintain a range of options from which to pursue well-being in the future. These aspects of a prudential athletic lifestyle, along with the contention that prudence can be defended in terms of rationality are explored and challenged. These challenges are not found to be persuasive in terms of abandoning altogether the notion that a prudent engagement with sports and physical activity is a rational one. Stronger objections to the current understanding of the recommendations of prudence are found upon examination of Griffin's theory of well-being. The fact that values on a list such as Griffin's might be realised in multiple ways casts doubt on the contention that certain choices now will necessarily risk future well-being. Second, Griffin's understanding of the relationship between health and well-being (health as a means to well-being) throws into doubt common interpretations of harms to health and their impact upon well-being. Accepting that there are multiple ways in which to fulfil those values constitutive of well-being, and that health is a purely instrumental good, offers a strong challenge to construing certain choices in the sports and exercise domain as imprudent and ultimately detrimental to well-being.",

      "title": "Effects of family affective involvement on aging self-stereotypes: An analysis based on latent growth model",
      "abstract": "<p id=\"C2\">With the aging situation in China accelerating continuously, learning how to maintain physical and mental health in old age and promote successful aging has become the focus of researchers. As the study on this topic progresses, more and more researchers are realizing that aging is not only a biological decline but also the result of an altered psycho-social structure in the form of aging self-stereotypes. As a prerequisite central process by which aging stereotypes influence individual psychological behaviors and physiological constructions, aging self-stereotypes increase the likelihood that individuals will activate stereotypes of the group to which they belong or identify and engage in stereotype-related behaviors, thereby directly influencing their expectations, goals, and behaviors regarding self-development. Previous research has shown that the “possible future selves” facilitate processes related to the stereotypical self-conceptualization of old age. The “possible future selves” often derive from various areas of the older person’s experiences. As the family gradually becomes the most important place for older adults to socialize, the experiences of emotional support and interaction from family members are likely to influence the expectations of older adults on their “possible future selves” and the internalization of stereotypes as they grow older. However, few studies have focused systematically on the effects of older adults’ affective involvement from family members on aging self-stereotypes. There is also a lack of exploration regarding the dynamic trajectory of the relationship between family affective involvement and aging self-stereotypes in a longitudinal framework. Thus, the present study sought to examine the developmental trajectories of family affective involvement and aging self-stereotypes in older adults and the causal relationship between the two.<break/>In this study, a sample of 257 older adults aged over 55 was followed up for one year. The participants were asked to anonymously complete questionnaires. They were assured by the researchers that the study would be conducted purely for research purposes and that participation was voluntary. Latent growth modeling and cross-lagged analysis were used to examine older adults’ initial level of and growth in family affective involvement and aging self-stereotypes, respectively, as well as predict family affective involvement on aging self-stereotypes.<break/>Latent growth modeling showed that older adults’ perceptions of affective involvement from family members decreased linearly during the follow-up period while aging self-stereotypes increased linearly. In addition, the initial level of family affective involvement significantly predicted the initial level of and growth in aging self-stereotypes among older adults. Specifically, the lower the initial level of perceived affective involvement of family members, the higher the initial level of aging self-stereotypes in old age. Older adults’ lower initial levels of affective involvement from family members also predicted more rapid growth in aging self-stereotyping. Finally, the rate of decrease in family affective involvement predicted the increases of aging self-stereotypes over time, that is, a steeper decline in the family affective involvement of older adults predicted a steeper increase of aging self-stereotypes. Similarly, cross-lagged analysis showed that family affective involvement negatively predicted aging self-stereotypes after six months.<break/>Our findings suggest that developmental trajectories of aging self-stereotypes in older adults are influenced by changes in family affective involvement. This study expands the existing research on family affective involvement and aging self-stereotypes. A better understanding of the causal effects of older adults’ affective involvement from family members on aging self-stereotypes can also help ameliorate intervention programs designed to reduce the internalization of aging stereotypes and improve negative aging self-stereotypes.",

      "abstract": "Individuals who are socially connected are happier and healthier than their more isolated counterparts. Over the past few decades, researchers have established that both the quantity and quality of our social relationships are unequivocally important when it comes to our physical and mental health, and our risk of mortality. Although the link between social relationships and mental health is well established in a couple, we have only just begun to identify explanations for this link. Recently, social scientists have discovered that the link between social relationships and health is explained by our behaviours (e.g., smoking, exercise, diet), various psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, mental health, cultural norms), and physiological processes. Aggression in marital relationship is defined as a manipulative, physical or non-physical form of aggression meant to negatively impact the development of relationship by social exclusion or harming the social status of a victim by spreading or behaving negatively. Research findings suggest that even infrequent experiences with relational aggression victimization are associated with lower subjective well-being such as depression, loneliness, and positive affect. This case study investigates the existence of relational aggression in a couple and the relationship between relational aggression and own subjective well-being. The participant in the study is married and from nuclear family. The study tries to investigate aggression level through the case study method and relaxation, yoga, meditation techniques used which was used to resolve the aggression and helps to achieve well being.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As people with mental handicaps are increasingly being expected to use community resources, stigma has often become an important component of their subjective experience. Both stigma and social comparisons help to define the person's status in a ‘normal’ reference group, and are important antecedents of the individual's self esteem. Fifty students with a mild mental handicap completed a self esteem and social comparisons procedure which yielded discrepancy scores between the way they saw themselves and others (friends, siblings, non‐handicapped others, and ideals). They also talked about their perceptions of stigma and their aspirations for their lives. The students who perceived the most stigma had the lowest self esteem, the lowest ideals, and had the largest discrepancies between their scores and the scores of others. They also felt the least likely to fulfil their aspirations. The students with low self esteem also tended to view others in a negative light and to experience impoverished interpersonal relationships. The study also suggested that some students may derogate others, especially younger opposite sex siblings, to maintain their self esteem. This points to the importance of social comparisons within the family. Some implications for research and the professional management of stigma are discussed.",

Nonetheless, raising the question is important because it presents the opportunity to counter ageist assumptions that old age is nothing but a period of loss and decline. I suggest a variety of candidate reasons for saying that ageing is good, for ageing persons themselves. These include renewable pleasures; new activities, relationships, and goals; and features distinctive of old age, such as connections with younger generations, long-lasting relationships, and an enriched outlook on life. I also acknowledge the various factors that may readily detract from the goodness of ageing, including poverty, disability, and the loss of family and friends. Hence, whether ageing is good is partially dependent on material and social circumstances. I conclude with three moral and political reasons for affirming that ageing is or can be good.",

But a more sociological view of scholarly misconduct suggests that the competitive structure, not individual pathology, is ultimately responsible for these departures from the norms of science. There have been studies, however, pointing to personality traits such as narcissism and psychopathy as possible explanations. It is important to note that not all individuals offend for the same reasons. Individual scholars can also have major stressors in their lives such as family illness or death, relationship problems, and financial strains among other stressors. The authors argue that the structure of academic work and cultural issues can interact with individual and situational factors to increase the likelihood of departures from acceptable practice.",

      "abstract": "A few decades ago the range of pathological forms of addictive behaviour was determined by the clinical consequences of excessive consumption of psychoactive substances. Today a lot of descriptions of new psychopathological phenomena appear, they are connected with a person’s new activities or opportunities under present-day conditions rather than with a person’s taking previously unknown chemical substances. These opportunities are connected with both having access to varieties of new gadgets and a wide range of means of creating illusions of the complete and prompt satisfaction of needs of communication, security, recognition, love, creativity, development. How much has the new opportunity era changed into the time of new addictions? The analysis showed that the prevalence of many forms of behavioural addictions is significant, particularly among young people. A disharmonic personality may shift from one addiction to another over time, illuding the people around them and specialists into thinking that this personality is “cured”. But the addiction will take another form, which will be “new” in a behavioural or technological way only. The “new” addictions reflect the ontogenetically ancient desire of a disharmonic personality to use an artificial method or technique to release high emotional tension, whether it is a psychoactive substance, communication in a social network or an impulse purchase in a shop. This way of getting rid of emotional discomfort makes a person feel pleased for a while, creates the illusion of solving a problem easily. Eventually, it leads to a reduction in the constructiveness of behaviour and the formation of addictions in a large variety of their forms. Under today’s conditions of intensive technological development behavioural addictions become more and more widespread, their definite clinical and scientific classification is not elaborated. Addictive behaviour takes various forms without changing the psychological and sociocultural mechanisms of its formation, and the degrees of social importance of these forms are varied.",

This motive evolved through natural selection because our hominid ancestors who were motivated to establish and maintain connections with others were more likely to survive and reproduce than those who did not make efforts to be accepted and maintain social connections. As a result of the need to belong, people often behave in ways that increase the likelihood that they will be socially accepted, and lower the likelihood that they will be rejected. For example, people may try to increase their relational value to other people by achieving goals and being successful, conforming to social norms, being a good social exchange partner, being liked, and being physically attractive. Indeed, people are rarely indifferent to the possibility of being rejected. Depending on the circumstances, concerns about rejection can result in several emotions, including hurt feelings, social anxiety, jealousy, embarrassment, guilt, and shame. Although every normal person is motivated to be accepted and to belong, people differ in the strength of their need to belong.",

Age effects mean that the change occurs in all individuals at a particular age irrespective of when they were born or the current time period. For example, an increase in socioeconomic differentials occurring at the age of retirement (irrespective of what time period is being examined or which birth cohort individuals were born in) would be described as an age effect. A cohort is a group of people defined by a particular attribute (or set of attributes). In the context of age-period cohort effects, ‘cohort’ refers to birth cohort. Thus, the group (cohort) are defined by the period (usually the year) in which they were born. Cohort analysis is the tabulation and analysis of data, such as morbidity and mortality rates or educational outcomes, in relation to the birth cohorts of the individuals concerned. Cohort effect (also known as generational effect) refers to variations in health status that arise from the different causal factors to which each birth cohort in the population is exposed. Every birth cohort is exposed to different social and environmental circumstances that coincide with its life span. Because the meaning of socioeconomic measurements varies by birth cohorts (for example, a female who was born in 1910 obtaining a university degree is likely to have been from a different social stratum to a female born in 1975 obtaining a university degree) cohort effects are important to consider when examining the association of socioeconomic position (SEP) with health and other outcomes.",

Hectic lifestyle, greater fluctuation of information, unhealthy workplace competition and overall greater workload are the source of stress for a vast number of people. Among the most common consequences of workplace abuse, there are the aforementioned tempo as well as the failure to meet all the work demands. Regardless its form, be it mental, physical or emotional, workplace abuse is referred to as mobbing. Not only does mobbing affect both the victim and the bully, but it also creates a considerable impact on the company itself. It is not just a matter of reputation crisis in case of escalation, i.e. mobbing also acts as an incentive to the creation of unfavourable corporate culture and work climate and it also affects their further development. Mobbing has recently become a common phenomenon in various companies and there has been a rising number of research on it. However, a sufficient number of scientific studies on the prevention of mobbing in workplace does still not exist.",

Stress is not the sole causative factor, but genetic as well as biological changes in the depressed individual play important role in the onset of depression.

In this article, psychological difficulties are understood as any internal barriers, violations, failures, etc., that prevents optimal adaptation, in this case, of migrants. The focus of research by modern scientists is aimed at studying socially disadvantaged migrants and labor migrants. There is not enough research on women who have moved to a new country with their husbands. Four groups of psychological difficulties were identified that impede the successful adaptation of women, as well as the clinical manifestations associated with these difficulties: women&amp;rsquo;s expectations regarding interaction with society do not coincide with society&amp;rsquo;s expectations which contributes to the emergence of frustration and deprivation; the predominance of external motivation when moving to another country (following a husband) results in loss of work and familiar environment which often leads to depression and/or somatization; the predominance of compelled contacts in the structure of communication causes an increased irritability; self-image as a migrant before the move does not coincide with real self-image in a new country generates intrapersonal conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;",

Unusual cultural beliefs are usually inadequate explanations for symptoms, no matter how bizarre the belief may be. Other parameters — genetic, family interaction, role expectation and so on — must be considered. Cultural beliefs can mask anxiety-laden intrapsychic dysfunction as well as maladaptive family behavioural patterns. Fulfilment of role expectation is a significant determinant of psychological functioning. Persistent awareness of psychopathology, together with a thorough familiarity with cultural aspects of an individual's background, is of utmost diagnostic importance. The absence of the latter leads to the danger of labeling and misunderstanding ‘symptoms’; the absence of the former can lead to the situation described in this case report. Therapeutic endeavours must be multi-variant, and cultural consideration is but one important aspect.",

Whereas homophobia is defined as negative responses individuals may have when in proximity to homosexuals, heterosexism is deemed to come from shared beliefs in the innate superiority of, or an unexamined bias toward, heterosexuality and not necessarily from an irrational phobia of homosexuals. In addition, the term heterosexism more clearly captures institutionalized discrimination. Debates abound regarding the appropriate terminology and measures that should be used to capture individual‐ and institutional‐level oppression experienced by sexual minorities in the twenty‐first century.",

However the comparative impact of different events, which often co-occur, has not been systematically evaluated, or studies assumed that the impacts are equivalent in both amplitude and duration, that different wellbeing domains are equally affected, and that individuals exhibit hedonic adaptation. We evaluated the individual and conditional impact of eighteen major life-events, and compared their effects on affective and cognitive wellbeing in a large population-based cohort using fixed-effect regression models assessing within person change. Several commonly cited events had little, if any, independent effect on wellbeing (promotion, being fired, friends passing), whilst others had profound impacts regardless of co-occurring events (e.g., financial loss, death of partner, childbirth). No life events had overall positive effects on both types of wellbeing, but separation, injury/illnesses and monetary losses caused negative impacts on both, which did not display hedonic adaptation. Affective hedonic adaptation to all positive events occurred by two years but monetary gains and retirement had ongoing benefits on cognitive wellbeing. Marriage, retirement and childbirth had positive effects on cognitive wellbeing but no overall effect on affective wellbeing, whilst moving home was associated with a negative effect on cognitive wellbeing but no affective wellbeing response. Describing the independent impact of different life events, and, for some, the differential affective and life satisfaction responses, and lack of hedonic adaptation people display, may help clinicians, economists and policy-makers, but individual's hopes for happiness from positive events appears misplaced.",

Emerging research indicates a link between suicide and men's active pursuit of hegemonic masculinity via emotional restriction. However, little is known of the continuum of suicidal men's emotional practice, and particularly how men mobilise emotions to actively pursue or resist hegemonic masculine ideals. This theorised life-history study aimed to explore the emotional lives of 18 Australian men who had attempted suicide. Findings indicate that men in this study experienced a range of emotions. However, during childhood, they learned that expressing emotions such as sadness reduced masculine standing, whereas expressing emotions such as anger through acts of violence could enhance masculine status. Although the gendering of emotions offered participants multiple avenues of action to pursue or contest masculine ideals, they remained vulnerable to suicide. For some men, it became impossible to conceal escalating feelings of distress. For other men, displays of anger and violence resulted in job loss, relationship breakdown or criminal conviction. Many participants indicated that suicide presented a means of ending painful emotions. Paradoxically, suicide could also become an alternative means of demonstrating masculinity, whereby the body became both the vehicle and object of violence.",

Common law or statute prohibits the 'physical punishment' of children in fourteen countries. Yet, in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Britain and the United States, the right to physical integrity accorded to adults is denied to children. In these countries, hitting an adult to cause pain and enforce compliance is unacceptable, and is more likely to be deemed a criminal assault. Hitting children, however, is a securely held, though increasingly questioned, parental right. It is common for children to be 'disciplined' through violent means.

      "abstract": "Far too many people claim that they did not know what they were doing when confronted about antisocial or illegal behavior they engaged in when intoxicated.Yet somehow they seem to recall most if not all pleasant or fun behavior when intoxicated.People tell their stories of how much fun they had when intoxicated, recalling most of the details of their drunken escapades.The literature suggests that people may not recall events that commonly occur and therefore some of their drunken escapades may not be recalled in full because they are routine occurrences.I postulate that events that are pleasant for an individual are likely stored in memory stronger than other events and therefore more likely to be recalled.Remember that sex related offenses and behavior an individual engages in are good or positive events for that person-they like what they are doing.Sex related offenses involve specific behavior that requires thinking (e.g., to counter victim resistance, to engage in specific sexual or other behavior on the victim, and to remove any evidence, and to escape the situation).Even with an unconscious victim, the perpetrator has to make contact without others seeing, remove any clothing, deal with any victim resistance should the victim awake, and escape without detection.I believe that sex offenders who engage in sex offenses while intoxicated have a memory of their offense and know what they are doing at the time they are doing it, despite claiming that they either i. did not know what they were doing at the time because they were intoxicated or ii.Have no recollection of the event because of a \"black-out\".Literature suggests that even when intoxicated, individuals are aware of what they are doing and recall events via free recall and cues interviewing.In addition, though alcohol may cause cognitive and physical impairment, focusing on the desired reward of coerced or forced sex may help the perpetrator counter some of the negative impact of alcohol.Intoxicated non-rapists pay attention to peripheral cues (e.g., social sanctions against rape, peer accountability) and choose to stop sexually assaultive and rape behavior.The factors involved in the decision to sexually assault and rape are many; alcohol intoxication appears to play only a peripheral role.This is also supported by the alcohol-myopia theory.Marijuana intoxication is also briefly addressed.",

When the paternalist's target is small children or other incompetents, it is usually thought to be morally permissible. But when it targets the fully voluntary choices of competent adults, it invites many moral objections.

      "abstract": "Background Young autistic people often experience social isolation and loneliness. Despite social isolation and loneliness increasing in later life in non-autistic populations, no studies have examined whether middle-aged and older autistic adults are at an increased likelihood of these experiences. Methods 428 adults (autistic n = 265) aged 40–93 years (mean = 60.5 years) completed questionnaires related to social connectedness/isolation, loneliness, and mental health. Group differences and associations were examined. Results The autistic group was less socially connected and lonelier than the non-autistic group. While there were few gender differences in social connectedness, women were lonelier than men in both groups, including when controlling for age and mental health. Social connectedness decreased with age in both groups, loneliness only increased with age in the autistic group. For both social connectedness and loneliness, age associations were significantly stronger in men than women. Conclusions Autistic adults may be particularly susceptible to social isolation and loneliness in midlife and older age. While autistic women were lonelier than autistic men, autistic men may be at greater risk of increasing social isolation and loneliness with older age. This study highlights the need for evidence-based interventions to address social isolation and to reduce loneliness for autistic people as they age.",

      "abstract": "Honour is in certain cultures used as a sort of measurement of a person, family or other association social value in the eyes of others and can be lost as well as gained. Men is considered to possess honour and women considered to possess shame. Men’s honour is therefore dependent on their control of, or lack there of, women’s dishonourable behavior. Honour related violence can in general terms be described as violence which is used to reestablish lost honour. The possibility to consider honour motives in relation to the value of a punishment (straffvarde) exists within Swedish legislation. There is no other expressed possibility to use this kind of motives as means to mitigate or aggravate punishment. Cases of honour related violence are however connectable to other aggravating circumstances due to its course of action with a specific focus on the close relation between victims and their perpetrators. The courses of action are also harsh to a point of applicability of other aggravating circumstances. Courts have in recent years gone from using synonyms and not explaining their effect on judgement to using honour by its name and explaining its position as an aggravating circumstance in itself. They have also suggested that it can not be used as a mitigating circumstance while establishing value of punishment (straffvardering). They have although expressed that the perpetrators cultural background can be used as such when measuring a particular punishment (straffmatning). Due to inadequate argumentation the legal position is still slightly unclear. By now considering honour motives as an aggravating circumstance in courts I consider the Swedish application of laws to be in correlation with demands set up by the principle of legality (legalitetsprincipen) in criminal justice in relation to murder at least. The legal position is still somewhat unclear and should be clarified by a ruling of Sweden’s supreme court or by new legislation. (Less)",

      "abstract": "THE greatest psychological blessing that can be conferred upon a child at birth is to be wanted by his parents. Conversely, an enviable asset for new parents is to be in a position to welcome wholeheartedly the new addition to the family. This is not to say that all unplanned pregnancies are unwanted or that they turn out badly, but that there is an optimum readiness for parenthood and this readiness is too often neglected in our society at present. This neglect is in part an indictment of medical and public health practice. There is a striking contradiction-rarely noted-in the way our society regards readiness for the responsibilities of parenthood. There is virtually no interference or even cautionary suggestion against parenthood for married couples who are biologically able to reproduce. Even for the unmarried, social sanctions aginst pregnancy act chiefly as punishments or threats, without supporting prevention: the prospect of punishment often fails as a deterrent. Even couples who decide that they are unable to rear a child properly have been-and are still being-denied full information and necessary implements to practice birth control. There still exists a medical-social bias that favors pregnancy as the inevitable outcome of sexual intercourse, especially for the deprived segments of our population. In this circumstance of effective, albeit unconscious bias, no attention is paid to the quality of parenthood in store for the child-to-be, or of the wishes of the parents-to-be in regard to their own future, except perhaps to deny the right of conjugal love unless they wish to procreate. By way of contrast we note the plight of an infertile couple (especially one of mature years, mixed religion or race, or low income) who wish to be parents. For an approved adoption procedure they must be thoroughly evaluated as to their qualifications as parents, and many adoptive couples will testify to the emotional stress involved in presenting oneself for this",

      "abstract": "Celebrity worship-is it more than just being a casual fan? To explore this question, a number of scales have been developed to assess celebrity adulation. The most prevalent scale of this type in the literature is the Celebrity Attitudes Scale. Using these types of scales, investigators have examined various college-student and community samples. Findings reveal that individuals with high scores on celebrity-worship scales tend to display a number of psychosocial characteristics. For example, these individuals may harbor concerns about body image (particularly young adolescents), be more prone to cosmetic surgery, and have a personality style characterized by sensation-seeking, cognitive rigidity, identity diffusion, and poor interpersonal boundaries. Likewise, celebrity worshippers may exhibit narcissistic features, dissociation, addictive tendencies, stalking behavior, and compulsive buying. Studies also indicate that individuals with high levels of celebrity worship are more likely to have poorer mental health as well as clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction. Of note, no study to date has examined celebrity worshippers for bona fide Axis I and II psychiatric disorders. However, given that celebrity worship exists along a continuum, it appears that being on the high end of this continuum is likely to be associated with a number of potential psychological maladies.",

The realization of such a network of relationships is of crucial importance for alleviating loneliness. Loneliness concerns a situation in which the number of meaningful, lasting, interpersonal relationships is experienced by the person as deficient, either qualitatively or quantitatively, and as less than satisfying in meeting the person's desires. Intimacy scores were higher for respondents who mentioned a partner as most confidant relationship than for respondents who mentioned either a friend or a close relative. People living without a partner, whose most confidant relationship has little or no intimacy, and who express the desire for new relationships can, as a consequence, be characterized as people with a high probability of loneliness. A confidant relationship with little intimacy was related to greater occurrence of loneliness.",

Fer-example, certain genres of social-psychological experiments have created ethical concerns because they involve mlsrecresenrarion of the purpose of the research to the partici­ pants or because they subject participants to stressful experiences. Some organi2ational or large-scale social experiments have been troubling because participation may be seen as damaging to the long-term interests of certain groups. Survey research has on occasion been criticized for probing into sensitive areas, such as sex, religion, or family relations. Participant observa­ tion research may constitute invasion ofpri\\'acy, particularly when Invesuga­ lars I;aln access by misrepresenting themselves or make covert observations. Cross-cultural studies have been charged with exploitation of Third World populations and disrespect for their cu\\lural values. I The purpose of the present chapter is to provide an overview ofthc types of ethical .ssues that confront the different methods used in social research. The overview is intended to be more than a checklist, ticking ofTthe problems that arise with each research method. but less than a comprehensive, overarching scheme for categorizing and organizing all orme problems.

      "abstract": "A significant number of youth and young adults who use drugs have fallen through the cracks of our juvenile and adult justice systems in terms of receiving any meaningful services. The situation is due to a number of factors, including the reliance on adolescent self-reporting utilized by most of the research, the failure of justice and other systems to routinely assess youth, including young adults, for either current drug use or indicia of drug use (e.g., “resiliency” or “protective” factors), and confidentiality and other restrictions pertaining to access to juvenile justice system information. Yet, retrospective reviews of drug use patterns for adults in the criminal justice system make it clear that drug use is beginning for most of these offenders during adolescence or before. Without adequate and developmentally appropriate treatment and support services for adolescents who are both “juveniles” and “adults” in terms of the jurisdiction of the courts overseeing their cases, many of these individuals may likely end up in prison and/or with the collateral consequences imposed as a result of criminal justice system involvement. The situation is all the more urgent with the recent research findings regarding the lack of correlation between chronological age for determining “adult” status for criminal justice purposes vs the much later age for adult brain development. This article urges (1) juvenile courts to develop mechanisms for systematically screening youth who come into the system for drug use and/or propensities for drug use and (2) adult courts to embark on similar strategies, and to develop adolescent tracks that would be geared to providing the services these youth (despite their chronological age) need and would otherwise not receive in the adult system and to continue these services beyond traditional timeframes for juvenile and/or “youthful offender” jurisdiction.",

We probed the developmental trajectory of this pattern and asked whether U.S. children (4 – to 7-year-olds) and adults expected other agents – including another person and God – to share their views. In contrast with some prior work, even the youngest children in the present study considered intent when making moral judgments. Although children did not distinguish among the agents when indicating how severely they would punish intentional and accidental transgressors, adults reported that God would punish less severely than would they themselves or another person. Furthermore, children and adults differed in their evaluation of how the agents would react to the transgressors: Adults and older children were more likely than younger children to attribute spiritual and religious reactions to God. These findings suggest that even young children's moral judgments are sensitive to information about intent but that the propensity to distinguish others' focus on intent from one's own emerges more gradually across age.",

      "abstract": "Peer violence, or more popularly called bullying, is a burning problem widespread throughout the world. Olweus (1979) defines peer violence as the intentional, repeated, negative behavior of an individual or multiple persons directed toward a person who cannot adequately defend himself. A large number of studies state that children with visual impairments are more exposed to violence. Certain characteristics of the socio-emotional development of children with visual impairment, such as lack of facial expression, the presence of blindisms, learned helplessness and others, negatively affect the development of their social competence which puts them at greater risk of violence. The aim of this paper is to review the scientific literature to clarify the phenomenon of peer violence in the population of visually impaired, and to examine the incidence and differences in experienced and committed violence in visually impaired persons. Although there are many studies in the world on the incidence of peer violence in the typical population, research conducted on children with disabilities and children with visual impairment is much less represented. As for the differences regarding to the sex of the students, the age of the impairment and the degree of visual impairment, the research findings do not agree. Examination of gender differences in experiencing violence in this population did not show unambiguous results. As for differences regarding the degree of impairment, most research supports the thesis that visually impaired children are more exposed to violence. A higher degree of risk is also associated with younger age, earlier onset of impairment, and multiple disabilities. All research results agree that rates of committing violence in this population are lower than in the typical population and that visually impaired children are still more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence. In terms of the degree of visual impairment, visually lowsighted students are more prone to committingviolence than blind students. A review of research on this topic points us to the need of rising awareness of this topic among professionals and parents of visually impaired children. Many forms of peer violence remain unrecognized by adults. In addition, peer violence leaves many severe consequences for the victim, but also for the perpetrator of the violence. One of the ways to prevent violence is strengthening social competence and tolerance, not only of the visually impaired students, but of the entire population of children, their parents and teachers.",

      "title": "My God My Choice: The Mature Minor Doctrine and Adolescent Refusal of Life-Saving or Sustaining Medical Treatment Based Upon Religious Beliefs",
      "abstract": "Adults, those over the age of eighteen, are presumed competent and therefore enjoy a certain level of autonomous decision-making free from outside intrusion. Those who have not reached the age of majority, on the other hand, are presumed incompetent, and thus require the aid of parents or guardians to assist in the decision-making process. Recent studies in adolescent development suggest that certain individuals, though not yet eighteen, have the requisite competence to make informed, autonomous medical decisions. In turn, some states have acknowledged the mature minor doctrine, which is based on the seemingly simple principle that minors who demonstrate a sufficient level of maturity ought to have their choices respected independent of third parties.Though many agree that certain adolescents reason on a level equal to that of young adults, debate surrounds the conclusion that minors should be permitted to consent to or refuse medical treatment especially when the choice has life or death consequences. A further complication exists when the decision is based upon religious beliefs. To date, the relevant literature focuses on parents' religious beliefs that influence medical decision making for their minor children, and minors' maturity to decide medical care for themselves. Although some courts and scholars have addressed these topics in the same document, little attention has been paid to the unique circumstances involved when adolescents attempt to refuse life-saving or sustaining medical treatment based upon their expressed religious beliefs. Failing to address the religious maturity of the minors in question creates the possibility that they will be permitted to die for beliefs that are not truly their own.The thesis of this paper is that under these circumstances practitioners ought to inquire into the maturity of the religious beliefs of the adolescents. Because the religious upbringing of children is directed by the beliefs of their parents and ministers, it is necessary to ensure that the adolescents have developed their own underlying and enduring aims and values. Thus, these adolescents should have the burden to demonstrate clearly and convincingly that they understand their beliefs, as well as the consequences of the medical decision. Only then can practitioners be comfortable that the minors, independent of third party influence or coercion, have the ability to make an autonomous decision to die for those beliefs in line with their true sense of well-being.",

      "title": "How to Talk About Incontinence: A Checklist",
      "abstract": "Incontinence is the medical term used to describe the involuntary loss of urine or faeces. Women, men, girls, boys and people of all genders, at any age, can experience incontinence. A person with incontinence can experience leakage occasionally, regularly or constantly; and leakage can happen at any time, day or night. A person may also experience leakage of urinary or faecal matter due to not being able to get to the toilet in time or not wanting to use the toilet facilities available. This is known as social, or functional, incontinence. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) understanding of incontinence is still in its early stages: the term ‘incontinence’ may not be known, knowledge of the condition is rare, and the provision of support is lacking. Those who experience incontinence may face stigma due to having the condition, and this may affect their willingness or confidence to talk about it. There is a need to better understand incontinence in LMICs, and how best to support people living with the condition to improve their quality of life. This requires having conversations with individuals that experience the condition, and with individuals who care for those who do: they will have the lived experiences of what it means to live with incontinence practically, emotionally and socially for them and their families. Living with incontinence can have a range of impacts on the people living with it and their carers. These include increased stress and distress; additional needs for water and soap; and restricted ability to join in community activities, school or work. Living with incontinence can also lead to a range of protection issues. The potential challenges that people face may be quite diverse and may vary between people and households. The checklist below, and corresponding page references to ‘Incontinence: We Need to Talk About Leaks’ can be used to increase your understanding of incontinence and the options available to support people living with the condition; and provide guidance on how to have conversations to understand how best to support people living with incontinence in your area.",

      "title": "Friendship Quality and Social Development",
      "abstract": "A high-quality friendship is characterized by high levels of prosocial behavior, intimacy, and other positive features, and low levels of conflicts, rivalry, and other negative features. Friendship quality has been assumed to have direct effects on many aspects of children's social development, including their self-esteem and social adjustment. Recent research suggests, however, that friendship quality affects primarily children's success in the social world of peers. Friendship quality could also have indirect effects, by magnifying or diminishing the influence of friends on each other's attitudes and behaviors. Having high-quality friendships may lessen children's tendencies to imitate the behavior of shy and withdrawn friends, but little evidence supports the hypothesis that high-quality friendships magnify friends’ influence.",

      "abstract": "The aging population is increasing, and their well-being is a critical issue worldwide. The concept of “self-perceptions of senescence” refers to how individuals view their own aging process, with successful aging characterized by good physical and cognitive functioning, absence of illness, and socialization. However, education and wealth can limit the number of successful agers. Psychological determinants, such as stress, anxiety, emotional stability, and social support, play a vital role in quality of life, while social determinants, such as access to health care, income, and social support networks, are also important factors. Age-related self-stereotypes can be acquired in two stages, as individuals become targets of age-related prejudices and stereotypes that encompass their traits, actions, skills, and desires. These commonly held beliefs, known as “old-age stereotypes,” stem from age being a prevalent social construct that affects many aspects of people’s lives.",

      "title": "Bracketed morality in sport",
      "abstract": "Although sport can promote moral values and prosocial behavior in youth, numerous research shows that sports engagement alone does not guarantee that outcome. Instead of striving for fair-play and sport excellence which not exclude justness, solidarity and moral integrity, contemporary sport frequently follows the Lombardian ethic, where \"winning isn't everything, it's the only thing\". Moral pause or bracketed morality, as described in sport, refers to the phenomenon of tolerance and acceptance of aggressive behavior or cheating, that will be morally condemned outside sports arenas. Accordingly, lower levels of moral reasoning and behavior have been identified in athletes and non-athletes in the sports-related situation in comparison to other life situations; in athletes when compared to non-athletes, in more experienced athletes, high-level athletes, team-sport athletes, and male athletes. Moral reasoning and behavior of athletes are influenced by contextual and personal factors, with coaches having a particularly important role to play. The positive influence of sport on the moral development of athletes might be related to pre-service and in-service education of coaches how to develop adequate moral atmosphere, and how to plan for moral decision-making as an integral part of everyday practice.",

      "abstract": "Efforts to tackle child sexual exploitation (CSE) and other forms of child sexual abuse (CSA) are often frustrated by the secretive and hidden nature of the abuse and associated difficulties in disclosure and identification. The chapter argues that the theoretical traditions which have shaped the field of CSA disclosure – and particularly theories that seek to explain non-disclosure – are firmly rooted in an understanding of sexual abuse as something occurring to younger children within the family. Child-related barriers are those which arise from developmental characteristics of the child and/or emotional turmoil experienced by the child as a result of the abuse. Relational barriers are those which arise from the nature or characteristics of a relationship or set of relationships which can be actual or perceived. Social barriers are those which arise from broader societal responses to or messages about sexual abuse that may prevent disclosure.",

      "abstract": "Sexual jealousy is both an attitude of mind and an emotional state: the latter resulting from a blending of emotions aroused by an affront to the instincts of mating, self-assertion and acquisition. Sexual jealousy is of particular interest to the psychiatrist, since in its morbid manifestations it destroys marital harmony (Gillard, 1896) and may lead to homicide or suicide (Mowat, 1966). Sexual jealousy may be regarded as a normal reaction but it is abnormal when: (a) the jealous person is haunted by what the ‘man in the street’ would recognize as a groundless conviction that his or her sexual partner has been, or will be, unfaithful; or (b) jealousy engendered by actual infidelity is of such intensity as to render the person dangerously aggressive. Examples of the second category are Ruth Ellis, who shot dead her unfaithful lover; and Pilar Garcia-Compte, who killed her husband after he had refused to break with his mistress.",

      "abstract": "Recognition of sexual and gender diversity in the 21st century challenges normative assumptions of intimacy that privilege heterosexual monogamy and the biological family unit, presume binary cisgender identities, essentialize binary sexual identities, and view sexual or romantic desire as necessary. We propose a queer paradigm to study relationship diversity grounded in seven axioms: intimacy may occur (1) within relationships featuring any combination of cisgender, transgender, or nonbinary identities; (2) with people of multiple gender identities across the life course; (3) in multiple relationships simultaneously with consent; (4) within relationships characterized by consensual asymmetry, power exchange, or role-play; (5) in the absence or limited experience of sexual or romantic desire; (6) in the context of a chosen rather than biological family; and (7) in other possible forms yet unknown. We review research on queer relational forms, including same-sex relationships; relationships in which one or more partners identify as transgender, gender nonbinary, bisexual, pansexual, sexually fluid, \"mostly\" straight, asexual, or aromantic; polyamory and other forms of consensual nonmonogamy; kink/fetish relationships; and chosen families. We argue that a queer paradigm shifts the dominant scientific conception of relationships away from the confines of normativity toward an embrace of diversity, fluidity, and possibility.",

      "abstract": "The development of social epidemiology and medical sociology over the last half of the 20th century, in which Leo Reeder played a central role, transformed scientific and popular understanding of the nature and causes of physical health and illness. Viewed in the early 1950s as shaped almost entirely by biological processes and medical care, physical health and illness are now understood to be as much or more a function of social, psychological, and behavioral factors. Utilizing a stress and adaptation conceptual framework, social epidemiology has identified a broad range of psychosocial risk factors for health, most notably: (1) social relationships and support; (2) acute or event-based stress; (3) chronic stress in work and life; and (4) psychological dispositions such as anger/hostility, lack of self-efficacy/control, and negative affect/hopelessness/pessimism, with new risk factors continuing to be identified. However, proliferation of risk factors must be balanced by conceptual integration and causal understanding of the relationships among them, their causes, and consequences. One source of such integration and understanding has been the rediscovery of large and persistent socioeconomic and racial-ethnic disparities in health. Socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity shape individuals' exposure to and experience of virtually all known psychosocial, and well as many environmental and biomedical, risk factors, and these risk factors help to explain the size and persistence of social disparities in health. Improving the socioeconomic position of a broad range of disadvantaged socioeconomic and racial-ethnic strata constitutes a major avenue for reducing exposure to and experience of deleterious risk factors for health, and hence for improving the health of these groups and the overall population. This in turn requires better understanding of the macrosocial forces that influence the socioeconomic position of individuals.",

Rather than integrate the new sexual body within the existing body image, these adolescents respond to the physical changes with behavior that attempts to maintain the omnipotent fantasy that they are in control of their bodies.

They feel as if the sexual body has the power to make them helpless by forcing them to submit passively to its demands.

Most of the social reactions to public sanitary facilities concern their quality, physical condition and level of cleanliness and maintenance. These most common negative reactions result from not only aesthetic experience of user, but refer to their feelings about territoriality and privacy. In addition, the general social attitude towards public facilities, often unconscious, is much more negative than attitude towards private bathroom or towards a general idea of ​​the bathroom. Similarly, most of human feelings about the body, gender, physiological needs, hygiene and privacy become stronger and more exaggerated in the context of \"publicness\" that causes the inevitable violation of the territorial and loss of privacy, which are increasing public apprehensions. Physiological needs appear to be more common in the public context, but also most of the difficulties and psychological problems are associated precisely with them.

Es gibt aber auch körperlich gesunde Männer, die in ihrem Leben bei einem versuchten Koitus keine Erregung hatten. Ihre sexuelle Reaktion ist derart gehemmt, daß sie daran zweifeln, jemals sexuelle Befriedigung mit einem Sexualpartner zu finden. So kann zum Beispiel ein Junge von einer besitzergreifenden Mutter erzogen worden sein, die ihm niemals gestattete, sich selbstständig zu entwickeln. Oder es wurde ihm beigebracht, daß Sexualität etwas schmutziges, gefährliches sei. Versagt er dann beim ersten Koitus, so kann er unfähig werden, die negative Erfahrung zu überwinden. Ein anderer Mann verspürt möglicherweise homosexuelle Tendenzen; dieser zu bewältigende Konflikt kann zum Versagen führen. In diesen Fällen ist eine intensive Sexualtherapie erfolgversprechend, denn der Betroffene benötigt mehr Hilfe als er von seiner Partnerin erwarten kann. Tritt eine Sexualstörung vorübergehend auf, sind die Partner am besten beraten, zunächst die Situation zu akzeptieren und sich klar zu machen, daß ein Mann nicht zwingend eine Erektion benötigt, um die Partnerin zu befriedigen. In den meisten Fällen wird ein Mann ein anderes Mal, unter günstigeren Bedingungen, wieder eine Erektion bekommen.",

With this understanding has come a serious confusion as to what constitutes normative sexual expression and what is sexual exploitation. This article discusses the two stances that have been prevalent: 1) discourage or ignore sexual behavior in children and hope that it goes away, or 2) persistent sexual behavior, particularly with other children, is either pathological or a definitive sign of emerging pathology. The disparity and myopic nature of both positions makes them unacceptable. How do we then take a more balanced and accurate view of childhood sexual expression, given our new sensitivity to children exhibiting sexually offending behavior? The Inappropriate Sexual Behavior Scale is presented as a tool to take into consideration normative sexual themes and behavior in children and the possibility of developing sexual pathology. The Discovery that Children are Sexual Beings Historically, it is difficult to determine just when the realization occurred that children, as well as adults, are sexual creatures with all the resulting ramifications. From a sociological perspective, it is clear that what our culture still considers part of childhood (11 to 18 years of age) in many cultures would have already undergone the rite of passage to adulthood. With this passage comes the responsibilities and privileges associated with adulthood—work, conscription into the army, leaving home, taking a partner, and freedom to be sexually active. Presently, in third-world nations, large percentages of their armed forces are younger than the legal age to view rated movies in the United States. It is ironic to the point of absurdity what children in our culture are exposed to, concerning sexuality and the restrictions we place on their response to this exposure. Television, movies, magazines and even comic books frequently depict mild-to-strong sexual themes such as nudity, sexual suggestiveness, sexual behavior and sexualized dominance and violence. Yet, about the only culturally agreed upon sexual behavior of children is to ask a biology question or two. When it comes to sexuality, the disparity between the physical or hormonal clock and the cultural clock exacerbates the difficulty.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is an integral part of well-being across the life course. For older people with disabilities (PWD), age and disability status intersect to create unique sexual experiences and needs that have long been stigmatised, resulting in limited access to sexual citizenship. Of particular importance are the socio-cultural realities of ageism and ableism that pose specific challenges to the pursuit of sexual wellness, and can serve to invalidate and/or inhibit access to a rich and beneficial intimate life. These realities are impacted by the varied biological, psychological, social and cultural factors across the life course to shape the sexual trajectory of older PWD. This chapter examines sexual citizenship for older PWDs via a life-course perspective, while considering the biological, psychological, social and cultural influences on the sexual trajectory.

      "title": "Behavior, Biology, and the Meanings of Temperamental Constructs",
      "abstract": "The renascence of temperamental constructs in discussions of both normal and pathologic development, after almost a century of polite suppression, is accompanied by the same methodologic and epistemologic issues that plague all inquiry into the relation between biologic and psychologic phenomena. During the half-century following World War I, when behavioristic explanations were ascendant, the burden of explanation for many behaviors rested on conditioned habits acquired through contingent interaction with the environment. If a habit happened to become associated with a physiologic reaction, it was usually treated as an epiphenomenon of the conditioned response. The study of temperamentally based behaviors has changed this attitude because the physiology is not viewed as epiphenomenal. Many investigators assume that children who belong to a particular temperamental category inherit a low or a high threshold for particular physiologic reactions to specific incentives. The sequence of behavioral profiles that develops is a joint product of both the child's physiology and the environments encountered. For example, about 20% of healthy 1- to 2-year-old white children react consistently to unfamiliar events that are difficult to assimilate or to cope with—like thunderstorms, large animals, or strangers—with both limbic discharge and an initial restraint on activity, sometimes accompanied by withdrawal. We call such children inhibited.1 The limbic activity accompanies the behavioral phenomena without being causal in the traditional meaning of that term. It is also understood that the temperamentally inhibited child must be differentiated from the shy child who was not born with any temperamental bias favoring limbic reactivity to unfamiliarity, but happened to experience an environment that promoted the acquisition of timidity and restraint.",

      "title": "[A case of diaper fetishism].",
      "abstract": "Some people cannot obtain satisfaction from ordinary sexual relationships; instead they prefer alternative methods. They are referred to in psychiatric terminology as paraphiliacs. Fetishism is a type of paraphilia in which a person is sexually attracted to objects and some body parts. Most fetishists do not intend to cause harm to other people, but may have problems when others become involved in the problem. Underlying personality disorders extending through childhood are thought to be the source of the etiology. Perverted people do not wish to change their behavior pattern. They never seek treatment from a therapist. Psychological issues obviously play a crucial role in determining the choice of paraphilia and the underlying meaning of the sexual acts. Psychodynamic models (object relations theory, self psychology, drive theory) can shed light on the meaning of a perversion. In this case report, a 22- year-old man with diaper fetishism is presented. When family dynamics are considered, the mother has been described as psychologically distant from her son. The fetish object was recognized during childhood at around the age of four. During puberty, the fetish object became sexually attractive. Our patient exhibited his first perverted behavior when he was six years old. Later, he could control this behavior. At the age of twelve, the perverted behavior became sexually arousing. This paper emphasizes the diaper fetishism case through the patient's past psychiatric and medical history. Diaper fetishism is discussed in the light of forensic, cognitive and psychodynamic theories.",

      "abstract": "Behaviour is an integral function which derives its existence, its, form and meaning from total setting of life situation. The setting is resultant of relationships and experiences which have begun to exert themselves from beginning of child's life and towards which a.child ha~s formed his own accepting or rejecting, aggressive or submissive reaction tendencies The individual's make-up at any moment includes an integrated overall combination of his attitudes evolved in past and oriented towards future. There is, of course, no limit to complexity of experience relationships which may combine to produce a certain attitude or attitudes. The attitudes which have a most profound influence on childIen and in response to which they develop their own attitudes, are those of parents. Our attention has been directed to thb importance of parental behaviour due to findings of psychoanalysts and to Freudian ideology. For example, it is stated that fear of toss of mother's love is ~ potent factor which may cause regression of a bleast-fea infant. great many people cannot overcome fearol loss of love; they never become independent enough and continue their infantile behaviour. HEALY, BONNER and BOWERS refer to importance of parent child relationship. For example they state : Lack of tender responses and feeling of not being loved may make it difficult for child to discard his aggressive inpulses. EARNEST JONES, an early authority on psychoanalysis made following statement : A person who from childhood had developed a hostile attiu d~ *owards one or other parent took up same attitude towm~l~ his or her children. JuNo and his followers were among first to _,aenUon relationship between parental attitude and child personality~ AICHHORN, a Viennese psychoanalyst in his book which has been translated into English under title Wayward Youth states: If child receives toc much or too little love then he becomes egocentric and reacts to personal demands in situation rather than objective demand of reality Based on psychoanalyst approach, concept of parental attitudes t-as brought such words into vocabulary as rejection and overprotection. Although terms rejection and,overprotection are now ~reely used in ~he literature not many attempts have been made to define t,lem exao;ly.

While non-Muslim spouses with schizophrenia in Malaysia may face annulment or divorce due to mental incapacity or unreasonable behaviour, recent legal and medical perspectives emphasize individual functionality. Many with mental illness, particularly during remission or with treatment, can validly consent to marriage and sustain meaningful relationships. As such, under Malaysian non-Muslim divorce law—unlike earlier approaches or Indian practices—mental illness alone is no longer sufficient for annulment or divorce without current, evidence-based assessments of mental and functional capacity.",

Substance abuse and addiction are seen in all parts of the world, among members of all religions, and in people of every age and both sexes. Social and cultural norms significantly affect the definitions and patterns of what constitutes \"substance abuse\" in a given community. International studies suggest that substance abuse is more common among people with lower educational attainment, those who suffer from a psychiatric disorder, and those with a history of previous substance abuse. Availability and community acceptance of substances of abuse have both been established as major risk factors for substance abuse. The use of psychoactive substances by humans is a nearly universal phenomenon, particularly if the use of tobacco and caffeine are considered. The final common outcome of the interaction is often manifested by loss of control over the use of a substance or substances.",

There are no commonly accepted standards for determining one’s capacity to consent to sexual activity and no assessment tools exist for this purpose. Moreover, statutory definitions of capacity to consent vary from conservative to liberal across jurisdictions. Determining whether a person has capacity to consent to sex necessitates striking a balance between individual autonomy and beneficence, which can be complicated in long term care settings where ageist taboos regarding sexuality can influence this balance. We will discuss factors that one might consider when determining whether an individual has the capacity to consent to sexual behavior, preliminary guidelines, and recommendations for the development of instruments and standards for capacity assessment.",

Daily dynamics between partners involving emotion processes, health behaviors, and collaborative cognition may accumulate over years to affect the longer-term physical and mental health outcomes of either partner or both partners across adulthood and into old age.

We tested preschoolers’ predictions about the prosocial or antisocial manner in which people would behave toward each other. Four stories were presented to 3- and 4-year-old children. In each story, the protagonists could either cooperate, act in terms of their own interests, or adopt a behavior unrelated to the ongoing scenario. Children as young as 3 years of age expected the protagonists to behave prosocially – and even more so if the protagonists were female. The results suggest that, even at an early age, children are inclined to adopt a “Rousseau-like” stance rather than a “suspicious” or “pessimistic” Hobbesian stance.",

      "abstract": "The adverse effects of legislation to require parental involvement in consent for adolescent abortion as reported in the literature are summarized in response to an essay supporting such legislation. First it is unclear whether parental involvement means notification participation in the decision or consent. Probably most minors simply want to have the procedure without their parents knowledge. Surveys show that over half of adolescents do freely discuss their pregnancy with one or both parents: whether they would do so if required is unknown. Of those that have not confided in parents one third say they would not seek medical care but choose self-induced or illegal abortion rather than speak to parents. There is much clinical and laboratory evidence that teens have poor decision-making skills relative to adults although how these empirical results transfer to real life situations is unclear. It cannot be assumed that all parents are more competent at deciding for their children than are the girls themselves. Furthermore many teens have other adults confidants or even their older boyfriends to help work through the decision. Pregnancy presents an opportunity for family growth and development but in many cases such as incest or parental resistance required parental involvement may be detrimental or disruptive to family relationships or even contraindicated. Mandatory parental involvement may benefit only a minority of adolescents and would subvert the adolescents human rights and confidentiality.",

Ada berbagai faktor pemicu terjadi intoleransi di masyarakat salah satunya adalah perbedaan dalam memahami ajaran secara tekstual. Yang Kedua, aksi pemaksaan hak asasi yang dilakukan oleh kaum mayoritas kepada pihak minoritas. Yang Ketiga, perbedaan adat istiadat. Berdasarkan faktor pemicu nya maka intoleransi akan memberikan beragam tindakan-tindakan negatif mulai dari penyebaran pesan intoleran, isu berbau rasisme, hingga ujaran kebencian kian berkembang pesat di sekitaran masyarakat. Akibatnya, konflik internal pun muncul yang akan memicu terjadinya pergesekan antara kelompok mayoritas kepada minoritas. Sikap paling benar dan main hakim sendiri kian hari berujung pada tindakan kekerasan. Maka dari itu kita sebagai warga negara Indonesia yang kaya akan agama perlu melakukan cara agar terhindar dari sikap intoleransi. Ada beberapa cara, yaitu tidak memaksakan kehendak diri sendiri kepada orang lain, tidak mementingkan suku bangsa sendiri atau menganggap suku bangsanya lebih baik, tidak menonjolkan suku, agama, ras, golongan, maupun budaya tertentu, tidak menempuh tindakan yang melanggar norma untuk mencapai tujuan sendiri.

Transsexualism or Gender Identity Disorder is present in all societies and civilizations. It also occurs in children and adult. Much higher incidence of transsexualism is in childhood and male. Treatment of transsexuals includes: psychotherapy, psychopharmacotherapy, hormonal and surgical treatment. During psychotherapy patient determines actual life goals for relations with a partner, family, friends and their job. Conducted training and inclusion in the group to make it through other people's experiences gained more realistic insight into the difficulties brought by the change of gender. If a person meets the criteria for a sex change, and after psychotherapy still has a strong desire to change sex, then it is subjected to a wide range of medical interventions. During this period is introduced in hormonal therapy. The procedure requires that the person before submitting to surgery has to be subjected to so-called real-life experience. For a period of 1-2 years, a person needs to live in the desired gender. If the person is still determined to change gender, then they approach to a surgical sex change.\r\nIn Croatia, a small number of experts are dealing with transsexuality. Transsexuality is considered just as a psychiatric disorder which contributes to the stigmatization of transsexual people.

This chapter demonstrates that the syndromes of early infantile psychoses, both the autistic as well as the symbiotic type, represent fixations at, or regressions to, the first two developmental stages of \"undifferentiation\" within the early mother–child unity. The pre-symbiotic, normal-autistic phase of the mother-infant unity gives way to the symbiotic phase proper. The symbiotic phase is followed by the so-called separation-individuation phase proper. The symbiotic psychotic syndrome represents fixation at or regression to the second undifferentiated stage of the mother-child unity, which is the stage of delusional omnipotent symbiotic fusion with the need-satisfying object.",

      "abstract": "Background: Loneliness is both a social and a health-related problem, and among LGBT people, feelings of loneliness are often exacerbated. According to the minority stress theory, stress and loneliness can be directly related to the discrimination and stigma that are experienced over time in a heteronormative society. Exposure to social stigma causes mental health problems, stress, and loneliness, coupled with increased social and economic vulnerability. Method: The aim of this study was to conduct an exploratory analysis of homosexual men’s feelings of loneliness and their relationship with experiences of discrimination throughout their life. A qualitative methodology involving focus groups and individual interviews was utilized. Results: The results show the double or overlapping discriminations that gay men experience as a result of their age and sexual orientation and, in some cases, their HIV status, and the relationship between said discrimination and the feeling of unwanted loneliness. Exposure to such intolerance is more common among those with a reduced social network, which limits their social participation and has a negative impact on their well-being. Conclusion. The aging process of LGBT people implies a new context of intervention and research that must be addressed to prevent episodes of unwanted loneliness that negatively affect the quality of life among this demographic.",

The mentally aberrant were seen as especially dangerous, since their condition was traced to a devilish infestation, and they were handled with great brutality. Blacks, too, often restive under slavery, were regarded as dangerous persons. Today, similar kinds of ascriptions as \"dangerous\" are applied to criminals, mental patients, and minorities—with similarly unconvincing evidence to justify the treatment such persons often receive. Danger ought to be determined on a social basis, not by theo logical or medical dictation, and the category ought to in clude all (but only) forms of human and group action which represent real threats.",

      "title": "The short normal child : influences on the growth pathway and final height outcome",
      "abstract": "Short stature is a common reason for a child to be referred for specialist opinion. Most will have no underlying pathology but dismissing a short child as normal may impose future suffering as the short adult is perceived to be psychosocially disadvantaged and to face greater health risks. Adult height, however, cannot be predicted from childhood height with any degree of certainty. Growth begins at the moment of conception and ends with epiphyseal closure some two decades later. Height, however, is not accumulated at a fixed rate throughout the growing process but consists of four distinct phases: foetal, infancy, childhood and pubertal. The intensity and duration of each phase is subject to wide variation and poor growth in any one phase does not inevitably compromise final height. To a large extent, both stature and the tempo of growth are genetically determined but social and environmental factors can have a modifying effect. For some children, poor environmental conditions can cause growth to falter but equally an improvement in quality may result in catch-up growth. The Wessex Growth Study is the first study to follow the growth of an unselected population of short normal children from school entry until final height together with controls of' average' height. A great deal of background information was also collected for each child including parental heights, birth history, social & family background, and medical history. To determine which short normal children become short adults this thesis has compared the patterns of growth of short normal children with their average height controls and assessed the impact of genetic and environmental variables on the growth pathway and final height. Before puberty, short children grew more slowly than those who are taller but the magnitude and duration of the pubertal spurt and the adolescent height gain were similar for short and control girls, and for short and control boys. The pubertal spurt of short normal boys, however, occurred, on average, some six months later than expected. Interestingly, although short normal girls had similar birth weights, skeletal delay and were just as likely as short normal boys to be considered short for family, the timing, magnitude and duration of their pubertal spurt were comparable with the control girls and with Tanner's standards. The mean height centile of both groups improved suggesting a continuing secular trend in adult stature within the UK. Nevertheless, the increase in relative height was greater for the short children implying some degree of catch-up growth, especially for boys. Indeed, short normal girls were three times more likely than short normal boys to attain an adult height below the 0.4^ centile and below their genetic potential. Some short children have become taller adults than others but in relation to their peers, a substantial number have remained short and failed to reach their genetic potential. Growth is influenced by many factors, genetic, social, environmental and emotional, but few variables were found to be predictors of the adult height of short normal children and much of the variance remains unexplained. This thesis demonstrates the individuality of the growth pathway and the difficulty in identifying those who will become short adults. Recognising which children might benefit from intervention requires a multi-professional team including the growth specialist, social worker and psychologist.",

The number of families composed as a second marriage or families where spouses deliberately refuse paternity/maternity, is increasing. The data shows a relatively clear trend family options. In the examined groups the majority of younger people focused on the family, where both spouses are raising a biological child. Older people recognize more easier the participation of the partner’s child. Key motives of having and raising children are emotional and individualistic. Only an insignificant proportion people associated the possession of children with the social status of the parents. Similar reasons are for paternity/maternity refusal. Unwillingness of young people to have children is based on their professional careers, the creation of material well-being, the satisfaction of own needs. Refusal of older people is considered as natural, although usually it depends not on the age, but on unwillingness to change an ordinary way of life. It should be noted that persons who are unable to have children are stigmatized, they are attributed with negative characteristics, even by those who themselves deliberately refuse paternity/maternity.",

      "abstract": "Twenty-one heterosexual women who were or had been married to bisexual or homosexual men and had children by them responded to a 28-page questionnaire that explored their experiences as wives and mothers. All of the married women expected a lasting, monogamous marriage. Only three had partial knowledge of their husband's sexual orientation before marriage. All of them went through a painful grief reaction when they learned that their husbands had emotional or sexual, or both, attachments to other men. The suffering was aggravated by feeling deceived or stupid for not having guessed the truth. What made it difficult for them to seek support from family and friends was the fear of encountering social disapproval or ostracism. They were afraid for themselves, their husbands, and their children. At the time of the study 11 of the 21 women were still married and living with their husbands, but most of them felt unsure that the marriage would last. Ten were in transition, separated, or divorced. Only three of the still married wives had complete confidence in the future stability of their relationships. These marriages were characterized by good communications, husbands who considered themselves bisexual, and an open marriage contract whereby wives could have heterosexual affairs. Findings cannot be generalized from this small convenience sample, but will hopefully encourage further research. The writers are also soliciting more subjects to enlarge the sample.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter discusses four kinds of problem cases involving people who are, or who might be, incompetent to give valid consent to sex. The first section addresses intoxicated consent. It argues that the range of cases where it’s not sufficiently clear whether a person is too drunk to competently consent to sex is considerably larger than it might at first seem and that it’s wrong to have sex with someone when they’re intoxicated to such a degree even if they’re probably not too drunk to validly consent. The second section considers dementia and sexual consent. It argues that, under certain conditions, a competently signed sexual advance directive can make it permissible to have sex with someone who has subsequently developed dementia and argues that this position can plausibly be extended to some cases where no such directive was signed. The third section discusses pedophilia. It rejects the argument that says pedophilia is wrong because young children cannot currently give competent consent to sex and instead argues that it’s wrong because they can’t reasonably be expected to give their retroactive consent to it once they become competent adults. The fourth section addresses the case of people who are born with severe and permanent cognitive impairments. It argues, although tentatively, that under certain conditions, the sexual behavior of such people can count as a form of valid consent to sex or can at least play the same role that valid consent to sex plays.",

Dinar Candy’s case brought to the thoughts on the limitation of pornography meaning and the determination on freedom of expression in action of wearing bikini. The research is conducted through a qualitative approach using secondary data. The results show, first: phornograph is limited by ‘subjective reason’ such as if the phornography is aimed for personal interest, then the action is not phornography. The other is ‘action-room limitation’ in which an action can be formulated as phornography if the standard and characteristic in the room where the action is done consideres that the action is obscene or aims to sexual exploitation. The room refers to specific place such as beach, roadside, hotel, or other specific places, not wide social room. Second: If someone’s feeling is expressed by wearing bikini in a room which based on its decency standard allows to wear bikini, then the action can be determined as freedom of expression. In contrary, in a room where bikini is considered against morality, or it is spread to public, then such action is againsting the phornogrphy law.How to cite item: Donandi S, S. (2022).

      "title": "Perceiving gaze from head and eye rotations: An integrative challenge for children and adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract Gaze is an emergent visual feature. A person's gaze direction is perceived not just based on the rotation of their eyes, but also their head. At least among adults, this integrative process appears to be flexible such that one feature can be weighted more heavily than the other depending on the circumstances. Yet it is unclear how this weighting might vary across individuals or across development. When children engage emergent gaze, do they prioritize cues from the head and eyes similarly to adults? Is the perception of gaze among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emergent, or is it reliant on a single feature? Sixty adults ( M = 29.86 years‐of‐age), thirty‐seven typically developing children and adolescents ( M = 9.3 years‐of‐age; range = 7–15), and eighteen children with ASD ( M = 9.72 years‐of‐age; range = 7–15) viewed faces with leftward, rightward, or direct head rotations in conjunction with leftward or rightward pupil rotations, and then indicated whether the face was looking leftward or rightward. All individuals, across development and ASD status, used head rotation to infer gaze direction, albeit with some individual differences. However, the use of pupil rotation was heavily dependent on age. Finally, children with ASD used pupil rotation significantly less than typically developing (TD) children when inferring gaze direction, even after accounting for age. Our approach provides a novel framework for understanding individual and group differences in gaze as it is actually perceived—as an emergent feature. Furthermore, this study begins to address an important gap in ASD literature, taking the first look at emergent gaze perception in this population.",

In these loss-of-balance situations, adults tend to maintain hold of the object, instead of freeing both hands to aid in balance recovery. The current study investigated the ontogeny of this behavior by examining if infants also maintain hold of objects when experiencing a fall. Sixteen newly standing infants were video-recorded while standing and holding a toy and standing while not holding a toy. Similar to adults, when infants experienced a loss of balance, they did not drop held objects. However, maintaining hold of objects only partially interfered with the use of upper-limb protective strategies while falling. These results suggest that the tendency to maintain hold of an object while falling is present early in development and with little independent standing experience.",

      "abstract": "Adults, those over the age of eighteen, are presumed competent and therefore enjoy a certain level of autonomous decision-making free from outside intrusion. Those who have not reached the age of majority, on the other hand, are presumed incompetent, and thus require the aid of parents or guardians to assist in the decision-making process. Recent studies in adolescent development suggest that certain individuals, though not yet eighteen, have the requisite competence to make informed, autonomous medical decisions. In turn, some states have acknowledged the mature minor doctrine, which is based on the seemingly simple principle that minors who demonstrate a sufficient level of maturity ought to have their choices respected independent of third parties.Though many agree that certain adolescents reason on a level equal to that of young adults, debate surrounds the conclusion that minors should be permitted to consent to or refuse medical treatment especially when the choice has life or death consequences. A further complication exists when the decision is based upon religious beliefs. To date, the relevant literature focuses on parents' religious beliefs that influence medical decision making for their minor children, and minors' maturity to decide medical care for themselves. Although some courts and scholars have addressed these topics in the same document, little attention has been paid to the unique circumstances involved when adolescents attempt to refuse life-saving or sustaining medical treatment based upon their expressed religious beliefs. Failing to address the religious maturity of the minors in question creates the possibility that they will be permitted to die for beliefs that are not truly their own.The thesis of this paper is that under these circumstances practitioners must inquire into the authenticity of the religious beliefs of the adolescents. Because the religious upbringing of children is directed by the beliefs of their parents and ministers it is necessary to ensure that the adolescents have developed their own underlying and enduring aims and values. Thus, these adolescents should have the burden to demonstrate clearly and convincingly that they understand their beliefs, as well as the consequences of the medical decision. Only then can practitioners be sure that the minors, independent of third party influence or coercion, have the ability to make an autonomous decision to die for those beliefs in line with their true sense of well-being.",

      "title": "Loneliness and Quality of Life among Elderly People",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONLoneliness is the feeling that emerges when social relationship are felt to be deficient and may arise from a perceived lack of companionship and refers to the experience of negative feeling due to inadequacy of existing relationship (De jong-Gierveld and Havens, 2004). Loneliness is defined as a subjective negative feeling related to the person's own experience of deficient social relations. Loneliness is a universal phenomenon embedded in the human experience closely associated with changing life circumstances.Loneliness may be regarded as a 'geriatric giants', leading to impaired quality of life, greater need for institutional care and increased mortality. Loneliness looms large in old age. Partners, friends, and relatives literally die on you. Your social circle keeps getting smaller with years. And the clammy fingers of death play a fearsome tune on your spine. Failing health, along with a decreased level of activity or social life can make old age frightening.Loneliness is defined as an individual's subjective experience of a lack of satisfying human relationships. In other words, it is a feeling that may be affected by the social relationship experienced by the individuals. Thus loneliness is a negative feeling causing distress to an individual Savikko's (2008).WHO defines Quality of Life as individuals perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns. It is a broad ranging concept affected in a complex way by the person's physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and their relationship to salient features of their environment.Quality of life is also related to a range of objective and subjective factors, including the range and quality of social networks and the experience of loneliness. While there may be a widely-held stereotype associating old age with social isolation and with loneliness (Forbes, 1996), international research evidence indicates that the majority of older people are neither lonely nor socially isolated (Victor et al., 2002).Loneliness often is regarded as the psychological embodiment of social isolation, reflecting the individual's experienced dissatisfaction with the frequency and closeness of their social contacts or the discrepancy between the relationships they have and the relationships they would like to have. Loneliness itself has been linked with decreased quality of life, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, elevated blood pressure and cortisol, heightened inflammatory responses to stress and modifications in transcriptional pathways linked with gluco corticoid and inflammatory process.According to Weiss (1973) loneliness can be divided into experience of emotional isolation or of social isolation. Emotional isolation represents the subjective response to the absence of a close and intimate attachment figure, e.g. the lack of a loved one or a spouse. Emotional loneliness is a subjective feeling and it can only be quantified by the individual experiencing it (Andersson 1998). In studies with a subjective perspective of loneliness, the results may reveal the intensity (very lonely - not at all lonely) of loneliness or only the participants' experience of being lonely (feels loneliness - does not feel loneliness).REVIEW OF LITERATURESingh and Kiran (2013) examined the relationship of loneliness of elderly female with their quality of life and other demographic issues through review of related researches. Findings revealed that loneliness is a particularly relevant issue in relation to elderly widows, whose rates of mortality illness and depression exceed those of their married counterparts, every woman who loses a husband through death experiences a painful period of bereavement, often accompanied by severe loneliness, obsessive thoughts of the deceased, restlessness, insomnia, somatic complaints, and even hallucinations of the deceased, and poor mental wellbeing. …",

Soulmate comes in form of stranger, healing, wrecking ball, twin and true love soulmates. These are highlighted in the elements of soulmate as one who makes you feel entirely whole, healed, and intact like no piece is missing. Adolescents make selection on the basis of physical attractiveness, economic and social status, age, religion. Finding a true soulmate result in having a feeling of security and protection, falling in love, sharing the same life goals, respect for each other’s differences and opinions. However, wrong mate choices could result in social and health consequences such as prostitution, medical problems and suicide. Kinetics and Health strongly emphasize on aesthetics, general wellness including spiritual wellbeing as strong indices of wellness which could be cached on during mate selection. Conclusively, mate selection is a matter of destiny ordered by God but as two loving people who have settled for each other’s strength or weakness, the decision is yours. The recommendation among others is that adolescents should be counseled to focus selection of mate on attitude as against physical attributes and made a priority among undergraduate students due to growing cases of rape in Nigeria.

      "title": "Terror, Trauma and Healing",
      "abstract": "Trauma can be defined as a stressor which overwhelm someone s ability to cope, characterised by feelings of helplessness in the face of some kind of personal danger. This can be the result of natural events, or more often circumstances such as the abuse of power, betrayal of trust, entrapment, pain or loss. It is not overly dramatic to claim that most people have some kind of personal trauma in their background. This may be the result of childhood experiences of abuse (or witnessing abuse), neglect or degradation; it may be related to adult experiences of violence or humiliation. Psychological effects worsen with chronicity, unpredictability, multifaceted sources, of a sadistic nature, and perpetrated by someone one has a relationship with. Even single events can have a significant and lasting impact. When you take into account rape and domestic violence (25% of women 2 ), sexual abuse of children (20-30% for females, 7-15% for males) and the fact that 25% of children in the US are living with an alcoholic parent 3 , it can be understood that trauma is widespread. Nature has evolved a dual brain system. The left brain deals with logical and verbal matters. The right brain stores experiences which are unconscious, emotional, somatic (non-verbal) and timeless. It organizes our motives and meanings. When it functions well it is the source of inspiration, intuition and creativity. When faced with trauma, it attempts to make sense of fearful or crazy situations, and in doing so offers up seemingly illogical emotions, illusions and delusions. Not all trauma results in damage; people survive and even thrive – more on this later. But when a trauma is not integrated it can be triggered; the right brain dominates and the left brain rationality recedes. We operate out of a traumatised state of mind, resulting in a narrowing of functioning. If I experience too much criticism, a lack of my needs being met when I am feeling vulnerable, or too much stress then I can tip into this TSM. When I do, a whole lot goes out the window: my sense of perspective, my rationality, my communication skills, even my caring for the other. I move",

      "title": "Beliefs about social mobility in young American children",
      "abstract": "Although actual experiences of upward social mobility are historically low, many adolescents and adults express a belief in social mobility (e.g., that social status can change). Although a belief in upward mobility (e.g., that status can improve) can be helpful for economically disadvantaged adolescents and adults, a belief in upward social mobility in adults is also associated with greater acceptance of societal inequality. While this belief might have similar benefits or consequences in children, no previous work has examined whether children are even capable of reasoning about social mobility. This is surprising, given that elementary-aged children exhibit sophisticated reasoning about both social status, as well as about the fixedness or malleability of properties and group membership. Across an economically advantaged group of 5- to 12-year-old American children (N = 151, M",

      "abstract": "OCIAL SUFFERING, THE TOPIC OF THIS VOLUME, brings into a single space an assemblage of human problems that have their origins and consequences in the devastating injuries that social force can inflict on human experience.Social suffering results from what political, economic, and institutional power does to people and, reciprocally, from how these forms of power themselves influence responses to social problems.Included under the category of social suffering are conditions that are usually divided among separate fields, conditions that simultaneously involve health, welfare, legal, moral, and religious issues.They destabilize established categories.For example, the trauma, pain, and disorders to which atrocity gives rise are health conditions; yet they are also political and cultural matters.Similarly, poverty is the major risk factor for ill health and death; yet this is only another way of saying that health is a social indicator and indeed a social process.The clustering of substance abuse, street violence, domestic violence, suicide, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, sexually transmitted disorders, AIDS, and tuberculosis among people living in disintegrating communities runs against the professional medical idea that sufferers experience one or at most two major problems at a time.That grouping of human problems also defeats categorization of such issues as principally psychological or medical and, therefore, individual.Instead, it points to the often close linkage of personal problems with societal problems.It reveals too the interpersonal grounds of suffering: in other words, that suffering is a social experience.That social experience occurs not only in the slums of cities in poor societies, like Kibera in Nairobi, or in shantytowns surrounding Johannesburg or Mexico City; it also flourishes in inner-city Chicago, the South Bronx, and the ethnic banlieue of Paris.Social suffering is shared across high-income and low-income societies, primarily affecting, in such different settings, those who are desperately poor and powerless.This is not merely a statistical IX",

      "title": "Child Sexual Exploitation",
      "abstract": "Child sexual exploitation (CSE) is a broad term that refers to a form of child sexual abuse (CSA) involving some combination of particular elements including power imbalance, grooming, manipulation, coercion, deception, fraud, force, threats, exchange, or status. Definitions, research, and resources are inconsistent and often conflate different kinds of CSE and CSA, making the concept difficult to generalize and questioning the utility of separating CSE from CSA. There are also persistent misunderstandings and myths that continue to pervade society, including “stranger danger” and the notion that CSE cannot happen in one’s own community, which have potential to negatively impact community protective behaviors. There are multiple kinds of CSE, both offline and online, and demarcating offline and online is not always possible or advisable. More than one type of CSE may be present in a single case because they are not mutually exclusive. These include child sexual exploitation material (CSEM), livestreaming, capping, online sexual solicitation and child luring, sextortion, commercial sexual exploitation, CSA tourism, human trafficking, and forced marriage. Common among these, although potentially in different forms, is a process of grooming. Because CSE is diverse, it is difficult to generalize about offenders and victims. However, victims are more likely to be female, whereas offenders are more likely to be male. Also common across crime types are a host of social, emotional, personal, and physical effects on and consequences for victims, some of which may be exacerbated if there are online elements such as images or videos. Current best practice suggests that responding to victims should be done through a trauma-informed approach that avoids victim-blaming. For offenders, risk management is done through assessments, post-release laws, and treatment, all of which have their own limitations. Because CSE is complex and includes a range of crimes, different theoretical and conceptual perspectives can be applied to the topic. Some of these focus on sexual offending against children generally, whereas others situate CSE within more macro structures. These theories and perspectives include Lanning’s situational versus preferential offender typology, the psychological concept of “cognitive distortions,” Finkelhor’s model of preconditions to CSA, the Good Lives Model of offending and rehabilitation, ecological systems theory, criminological perspectives that emphasize situational and environmental factors, and anthropological perspectives on the internet. Prevention of CSE victimization should be evidence-based and not founded on misconceptions or myths; however, not all prevention programs have engaged with realistic and accurate understandings of CSE. Overall, CSE is complex, and nuance is required in research, practice, and policy to reflect this complexity.",

      "title": "Stigmatizacija osoba s tjelesnim invaliditetom",
      "abstract": "This graduation thesis wants to expose the main information’s regarding physical disabled people and stigmatization of persons with physical disabilities throughout different systems. As the society has been developing trough history, the attitude outward this group of people has been changing as well. Particular communities, although they were often completely intolerant, managed to realize the importance of leveling the persons with physical disabilities with the rest of the community. However, inside of many, the phenomenon of stigmatization of people with physical disabilities is still present. The indications of stigmatization in their families can also be seen (there are numerous stigmatization examples of parents, brothers, sisters and other members), that lead to psychosocial difficulties in every day behavior. Stigmatization can be visible on every single level of education system, especially reflected trough inappropriate educational institutions. Although unemployment of people with disability without doubt leads to unwanted financial, psychological and social consequences, employers constantly avoid employing them. The positive changes in reducing and easing the stigma can be found, but it is extremely hard to completely clear the tendencies of looking people through the eyes of their disability. For those people to be recognized as people with equal possibilities and abilities, the social workers assistance is an essential need. Informing the environment, advocating for rights, strengthening the people with disabilities and their families by providing different forms of support, are indispensable and essential segments of social labor as a profession.",

      "abstract": "The term neurodiversity was coined by the Australian Sociologist Judy Singer more than twenty years ago. Singer’s own views regarding neurodiversity have developed since this time, yet were initially based on the principle of biodiversity and the stating of a ‘brute fact’ of the diversity of embodied experiences, and not viewed as a ‘good or bad’ thing as such. Over time growing numbers of people, particularly autistic activists identified as proponents of the ‘neurodiversity movement’ or variations of what has been referred to as the ‘neurodiversity paradigm’. The neurodiversity movement has been conceptualised in different ways, but largely refers to the promotion of civil rights for ‘neuro-minority’ or ‘neurodivergent’ populations (as sometimes referred to). Perhaps what causes the most controversy (and also misunderstanding) has been on the notion of the ‘neurodiversity paradigm’. Variations of which often work with variations of a social or post-social model of disability, promoting participation and experiential knowledge.",

      "title": "Il suicidio in adolescenza e nella prima giovinezza",
      "abstract": "In countries with high economic development, the rapid and non-psychologicallyintegrated enforcement of the new rights recently acquired by individuals seems to have influenced their psychological structures, and therefore also their approach to suicide. Women’s acquired right to study and pursue a professional career, the right of abortion and divorce, as well as the possibility of in-utero genetic manipulation – fuelling fantasies of omnipotence/impotence – have rapidly changed customs and morality, triggering an extreme stimulation of the most preconscious anxieties of self-and-object-destruction. The present variability of the possible roles in society facilitates – in the individuals, often through impulsive activity – the disguise of the intrapsychic condition of self-passiveness (Rapaport). The destructive behaviour arising from the difficulty in self-control – such as an increase of juvenile delinquency, of self and etero-mutilations, and also suicide attempts – is too often accepted as a consequence of rational actions. At present, existential crises frequently reveal themselves in the most dramatic and essential way – an unexpected suicide under conditions of apparent well-being. As far as international literature goes, the groups with a higher risk of mortal suicide – apart from the category of adolescents and young adults, classically referred to this way – are those of people separated, divorced, and adopted, as well as seniors – especially those of male sex. These are the individuals that during their life have usually suffered more role losses. Given the potential associated with every life crisis towards reaching a better structural equilibrium – regarding synthesis and integration – a crisis-intervention becomes of critical importance especially for those risk groups. A short-time psychotherapeutical intervention – with main objective the hic-et-nunc problems of aggressiveness in the therapeutical relation – is fundamental, so that the most preconscious anxieties of self- and object-destruction can be better tolerated and opposed.",

The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship. We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights-older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects.
