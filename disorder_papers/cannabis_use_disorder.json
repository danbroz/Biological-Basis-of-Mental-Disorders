      "title": "Substance Abuse and Its Addiction Among Young Adults",
      "abstract": "Substance use refers to the intake of drugs, like alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, inhalants, tobacco, and other harmful substances that lead to the deterioration of oneself, society, or both. It comprises both physical dependence and psychological dependence. Physical dependence caused by excessive intake of a drug refers to a change in the physiological state in which withdrawal symptoms develop when drugs are discontinued whereas psychological dependence refers to the state of need to continue using the drug even without physical dependence. Substance use also known as drug abuse or drug addiction is usage of drugs up to a certain level that disrupts the individual return to its normal state or condition prior to the intake. It could range from mild, moderate or severe depending on the drug intake. Addiction can supposedly be a form of drug abuse in terms of severity. Addiction refers to the need to be associated with something (here a substance) ignoring the adverse effects it can cause. It can also refer to a strong inclination towards repeated use of a substance. The higher the addiction, the higher the risk of developing a substance use disorder (SUD).",

      "abstract": "Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive agent in the leaves of cannabis (marijuana) plants. Many synthetic cannabinoids have been recently developed. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States; almost 20 million Americans currently consume cannabis. People who use cannabis may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after use. Synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Cessation after regular use may result in drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness. Metabolites of THC can be detected in the urine up to 1 month after last use; some medications can cause false-positive tests. Serious medical complications of cannabis use are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Synthetic cannabinoid use is associated with significant neuropsychological effects. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or reduce use. There are no medications that have been shown to be effective.",

      "abstract": "The use of cannabis is most often associated with that of tobacco. While the addictive power of cannabis is low, that of tobacco is high. The regular use of both tobacco and cannabis is at the origin of the increase in dependence on each substance, which makes stopping this double consumption often difficult.

Practitioners should identify this dual use, advise stopping and offer their help after a careful evaluation of both consumptions and their causes. The management includes psychotherapeutic support; If the efficacy of medications to aid stopping cannabis has not been proven to aid in stopping cannabis, nicotine replacement therapy can limit withdrawal syndrome, craving and improve patients' adherence to monitoring.The mobilization of practitioners in the management of patients and the development of effective cannabis cessation pharmacotherapies are essential.L’usage du cannabis est le plus souvent associé à celui du tabac.

      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, may be a disease that affects an individual's brain and behaviour and results in an inability to regulate the utilization of a legal or illegal drug or medication. Substances like alcohol, marijuana and nicotine are also considered drugs. When you're addicted, you'll continue using the drug despite the harm it causes . Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a narcotic in social situations, and, for a few people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, white plague begins with exposure to prescribed medications, or receiving medications from a lover or relative who has been prescribed the medication. The risk of addiction and the way fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, like opioid painkillers, have a better risk and cause addiction more quickly than others. As time passes, you'll need larger doses of the drug to urge high. Soon you'll need the drug just to feel good. As your drug use increases, you'll find that it's increasingly difficult to travel without the drug. Attempts to prevent drug use may cause intense cravings and cause you to feel physically ill (withdrawal symptoms). You may need help from your doctor, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program to beat your white plague and stay drug-free. Drug addiction isn’t about just heroin, cocaine, or other illegal drugs. You can get hooked in to alcohol, nicotine, opioid painkillers, and other legal substances. At first, you'll prefer to take a drug because you wish the way it causes you to feel. You may think you can control how much and how often you use it. But over time, drugs change how your brain works. These physical changes can last a long time. They make you lose self-control and may lead you to damaging behaviours.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction and drug abuse, chronic or habitual use of any chemical substance to alter states of body or mind for other than medically warranted purposes. Addiction is more often now defined by the continuing, compulsive nature of the drug use despite physical and/or psychological harm to the user and society and includes both licit and illicit drugs, and the term \"substance abuse\" is now frequently used because of the broad range of substances (including alcohol and inhalants) that can fit the addictive profile. Psychological dependence is the subjective feeling that the user needs the drug to maintain a feeling of well-being; physical dependence is characterized by tolerance (the need for increasingly larger doses in order to achieve the initial effect) and withdrawal symptoms when the user is abstinent. There are a lot of effects of drug addiction to the economy, society, and family. Drug addiction affects individual's physical and mental health. Drug addicts are burden for a family and society. It is a great challenge for all nations of the world to prevent drug addiction. This article reviews the effects of drug addiction in details.

      "abstract": "Background: Synthetic tobacco is a type of tobacco made from a mixture of chemicals.This mixture is then sprayed on pieces of leaves or tobacco cigarettes and then rolled like using marijuana by smoking.Its chemicals are deliberately artificially created to mimic the effects of marijuana or ecstasy.The effects of synthetic tobacco include excessive pleasure, hallucinations, confusion, anxiety, and dependence (addictive). Method:We selected several references from textbooks and journals until 2023 containing information about synthetic cannabinoids.Case report: An 18-year-old man used synthetic tobacco for one year and claimed to feel calm after consuming it, which caused a desire to continue consuming it every day until the last two weeks.The patient was known to consume this synthetic tobacco more often than usual, so the patient experienced hallucinations and continued to want to consume this type of tobacco.The patient experiences symptoms of auditory hallucinations.The patient also feels anxious, looks confused, and feels like a gorilla hit him because it made his body stiff, and he was unable to move. Conclusion:Some signs and symptoms overlap between cannabis and synthetic cannabis.Doctors who confirmed the use of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) need to be vigilant in providing supportive care and can perform supporting examinations to support diagnosis if needed.",

      "abstract": "Consideration of cannabis as a medicinal entity is an ongoing discussion that requires additional clinical and laboratory research. Marijuana smoking deposits 4x times more tar in the lungs as compared to tobacco smoke and amount of some pro-carcinogens are up to 2x times greater in marijuana tar. Determination of Dependence/Physical Harm relationship by investigators shows a proximity of cannabis to khat, LSD, ecstasy, alkyl nitrites, and methylphenidate. Non-users that are exposed to cannabis inhalant may suffer loss of coordination, dizziness, confusion, difficulty walking, blurred vision, and vomiting. Illicit drug use has been shown to be strongly associated with homicide events. Psychotropic effects from THC inhalant reaches a maximum after 15 to 30 minutes. Psychotropic effects from oral ingestion of THC reaches maximum level after 2 to 3 hours. Marijuana smoke contains higher levels of specific toxins than tobacco smoke. Ongoing research outcome challenges the concept that marijuana smoke is less harmful than tobacco smoke. Marijuana smoke causes lung damage quickly and could out pace tobacco smoke by as much as 20 years. Studies has shown cannabis usage worsens the course of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and that adolescents possess a greater risk from cannabis than older individuals. Cannabis abuse could be an independent risk factor for the further development of psychotic disorders. Further research and study is warranted concerning clinical application of cannabis.  2010 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA",

      "title": "The health effects of cannabis: Key issues of policy relevance",
      "abstract": "Cannabis remains one of the most widely abused drugs worldwide, with a substantial number of users in many Western societies. Epidemiological studies reveal that most users are young individuals either in their teens or early twenties. The most prevalent pattern of use is intermittent. Traditional use of cannabis is also prevalent in many countries. The main acute adverse effects of cannabis are cognitive impairment, especially of attention and memory, psychomotor impairment, and a possible increased risk of traffic accidents. The main physical and psychological health effects of chronic, heavy cannabis use, especially daily use, over many years, are most commonly respiratory disease, dependence and subtle cognitive impairment. It is estimated that approximately 10 per cent of persons who try cannabis progress to daily use, with a further 20 to 30 per cent using it on a weekly basis. Cannabis use during pregnancy is likely to result in shortened gestation and low-birth-weight babies. Other potential dangers of chronic heavy use that remain to be confirmed include an increased risk of developing cancer, a decline in occupational performance, impaired educational attainment in adolescents and birth defects. While it is known that underachieving adolescents are more likely to smoke cannabis, a cause-effect relationship has not been established. There is considerable anecdotal information regarding the therapeutic usefulness of smoking cannabis. In recent times, the most intense interest has been directed towards the prevention of weight loss in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), although management of pain, prevention of emesis and control of glaucoma and movement disorders still command attention. Of these potential uses, treatment of cachexia in AIDS patients and of chronic pain seems most worthy of scientific validation. Efforts to develop synthetic cannabinoid derivatives should remain a primary goal for treatment of most such disorders. The discovery of an endogenous cannabinoid system provides a means not only of developing new therapeutic agents but also of establishing the biological consequences of long-term cannabis exposure on the brain. The localization of cannabinoid receptors in brain areas associated with some of the most prominent pharmacological effects of cannabis, that is, cognition, pain perception and movement, provides an insight into the physiological importance of those receptors. The identification of anandamide, the endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptor, provided credence for a naturally occurring endogenous cannabinoid system in the brain. This endogenous system adapts to chronic exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by a reduction in the number of receptors, the physiological consequence of which remains to be established.",

      "title": "Health aspects of cannabis: revisited",
      "abstract": "Literature pertaining to the effects of cannabis use and health which has been published during the past 11 years has been reviewed. Many older concerns about adverse effects on health (chromosomal damage, 'cannabinol psychosis', endocrine abnormalities, cardiac events, impaired immunity) no longer seem to elicit much interest. Continuing concerns about the adverse cognitive effects of chronic use indicate that these can be demonstrated by proper testing; some studies suggest that they may be long-lasting. Although cannabis does not produce a specific psychosis, the possibility exists that it may exacerbate schizophrenia in persons predisposed to that disorder. However, evidence from retrospective surveys must always be questioned. Tolerance and dependence have occurred in man, confirming previous findings in many other species. Addiction tends to be mild and is probably less severe than with other social drugs. Driving under the influence of cannabis is impaired acutely; how long such impairments last is still unknown. More exacting tasks, such as flying an airplane, may be impaired for as long as 24 hours. While there is no doubt that marijuana smoke contains carcinogens, an increase in cancer among users has thus far been anecdotal. Because of the long latent period between cancer induction and initiation of cigarette smoking, the full story is yet to be told. Marijuana use during pregnancy is not advised although the consequences are usually not greater than those of smoking cigarettes, and far less than those from alcohol use. Whether smoked marijuana should become a therapeutic agent requires a cost-benefit analysis of the potential benefits versus the adverse effects of such use as we now know them.",

Recent Findings Cannabis, particularly the cannabinoid Δ9-tegrahydrocannabinol (THC), is associated with increased appetite, food cravings, overconsumption, and decreased physical activity. Cannabidiol (CBD) appears to be associated with decreased appetite. While cannabis use is not correlated with binge eating, cannabis use disorder is associated with loss of control eating. Despite cannabis’ association with unhealthy eating and sedentary behavior, most studies suggest that cannabis use is not associated with weight gain, or may even facilitate weight loss. Summary The state of the literature regarding the relationship between cannabis, weight, and weight-related behaviors is complex. Most studies do not differentiate between cannabinoid profiles, routes of administration, or whether cannabis use is problematic. Patients presenting for weight management should be cautioned about cannabis, particularly THC, potentially increasing risk of unhealthy eating and activity patterns.",

Pemakai yang menggunakan obat-obatan tersebut dalam dosis yang berlebih, efeknya justru membuat tubuh terlalu rileks sehingga kesadaran berkurang drastis. Beberapa kasus si pemakai tidur secara terus-menerus dan tidak bangun-bangun. Hilangnya kesadaran tersebut membuat koordinasi tubuh terganggu, sering bingung, dan terjadi perubahan perilaku. Dampak narkoba yang cukup berisiko tinggi adalah hilangnya ingatan sehingga sulit mengenali lingkungan sekitar. Dampak narkoba yang paling buruk terjadi jika si pemakai menggunakan obat-obatan tersebut dalam dosis yang tinggi atau yang dikenal dengan overdosis. Pemakaian sabu-sabu, opium, dan kokain bisa menyebabkan tubuh kejang-kejang dan jika dibiarkan dapat menimbulkan kematian. Inilah akibat fatal yang harus dihadapi jika sampai kecanduan narkotika, nyawa menjadi taruhannya. Bahaya narkoba bukan hanya berdampak buruk bagi kondisi tubuh, penggunaan obat-obatan tersebut juga bisa mempengaruhi kualitas hidup misalnya susah berkonsentrasi saat bekerja, mengalami masalah keuangan, hingga harus berurusan dengan pihak kepolisian jika terbukti melanggar hukum. Pemakaian zat-zat narkotika hanya diperbolehkan untuk kepentingan medis sesuai dengan pengawasan dokter dan juga untuk keperluan penelitian. Selebihnya, obat-obatan tersebut tidak memberikan dampak positif bagi tubuh. Yang ada, kualitas hidup menjadi terganggu, relasi dengan keluarga kacau, kesehatan menurun, dan yang paling buruk adalah menyebabkan kematian. Karena itu, jangan coba-coba memakai barang berbahaya tersebut karena resikonya sangat tinggi bagi hidup dan kesehatan.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Treating addiction is more challenging when there are co-addictions. Tobacco smoking is commonly associated with substance abuse, alcohol use disorders, excessive caffeine intake and pathological gambling among other addictions. Smoking reduction and cessation programmes´ objectives benefit from interventions targeting co-addictions. Objectives Difficulties arising from smoking reduction and cessation in the context of co-use of cannabis prompt literature review and reflection of a smoking cessation programme team. Methods Pubmed and Google Scholar literature search using terms smoking cessation / tobacco cessation and cannabis. Results Co-use of tobacco and cannabis is: 1) very common, 2) associated with greater prevalence of morbidity and social problems, 3) associated with greater dependence of the other substances, 4) negatively influences quit outcomes of either, 5) increases the risk of relapse. Co-users are more likely to perceive the harmful effects of tobacco, have greater motivation and are more likely to quit tobacco than cannabis, which may be perceived as low risk. Treatment of either tobacco smoking or cannabis use may lead to compensatory increase in use of the other substance. There is a significant lack of literature on co-use treatment strategies. Conclusions Co-use of tobacco and cannabis makes cessation and relapse prevention of either addiction more difficult and should be taken into account in smoking reduction and cessation programmes and in cannabis treatment interventions. Treatment targetting both tobacco and cannabis use, either simultaneously or sequentially, is likely more successful than interventions targeting only either one. Much remais to be studied on how to treat co-use of tobacco and cannabis.",

      "abstract": "Many cannabis users 'mature out' of their drug use, and factors of cannabis use cessation have been identified. However, very little in-depth knowledge is available about the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Criminological studies have gained interesting insights in desistance from crime, yet these perspectives are rarely used in drug research. This qualitative, three-year longitudinal study explored the processes involved in desistance from frequent cannabis use for young adults. Using a narrative approach, desisters (frequent users who successfully quit their cannabis use) and persisters (frequent users with a persistent desire and unsuccessful attempts to quit) were compared. In the course of the study, desisters mainly exhibited increasing agency and goal setting, established strategies to achieve these goals, and could envision another self. Desistance was generally induced by life events that became turning points. Persisters experienced largely similar events, but lacked goals and strategies and held external factors responsible for their life course and failed quit attempts. Identity change is at the core of desistance from frequent cannabis use, and the meaning-giving to life events and experiences is essential. Agency is a necessary ingredient for desistance, develops over time and through action, and leads to a new drug-free identity with desistance in turn increasing agency.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use and somatic consequences. Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world. It is perceived as a low-risk drug, as it is a plant, although many warnings in the medical literature underlined increased complications of cannabis use. Acute and chronic cannabis use is known to be harmful inducing psychiatric and addictive effects. An increase in the potency of cannabis as defined by a high ratio between the more important components, tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol has been observed for years, which leads to more serious complications. Evidence indicates that both acute and chronic consumptions of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Synthetic cannabinoid has rapidly spread for the last few years; they are chemical substances inducing similar psychoactive effects to cannabis. Although, cannabis users call these substances \"cannabis\", synthetic cannabinoids have different pharmacological properties, which make them dangerous substances leading to more serious complications. Physicians dealing with cannabis users should be aware of these differences between vegetal cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids.Complications somatiques du cannabis. Le cannabis reste la substance illicite la plus consommée dans le monde. La perception du cannabis comme une substance peu dangereuse au regard de son origine végétale participe à l’augmentation de son usage. La puissance du cannabis est définie par un ratio élevé entre les composants les plus importants du cannabis, c’est-à-dire letétrahydrocannabinol et le cannabidiol. Les effets aigus et chroniques de l’usage du cannabis comportent un risque majoré de troubles psychiatriques, mais aussi de complications cardiovasculaires, neurovasculaires et neurocognitives, respiratoires et de sevrage en cas de dépendance. Avec l’apparition récente des cannabinoïdes de synthèse qui sont des substances chimiques contrairement au cannabis issu de la plante, des complications plus sévères sont décrites même lors d’usage unique. Ces nouvelles substances de synthèse, bien qu’appelées aussi cannabis par les utilisateurs, ont conduit à une modification des prises en charge des usagers en raison d’une toxicité aiguë et chronique plus sévère.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine is a powerful euphoriant and it relieves, though only transiently, depression, dread and dysphoria. New patterns of cocaine abuse, such as the inhalation of vaporized cocaine base, the intravenous injection of cocaine hydrochloride and the smoking of coca paste, produce a brief elation that quickly gives way either to a return to the baseline mood or to displeasure, resulting in a strong desire to return to the momentary ecstatic experience, a cycle that leads to compulsive use. The enormous profits made from illicit traffic in cocaine lead to corruption, violence and political destabilization. The individual costs of cocaine abuse include loss of personal fortunes, jobs and families. The safety of cocaine use is a myth. There are a number of ways in which cocaine can be lethal. The high doses of cocaine abused today induce physical dependence, but this is less a contributory factor than the intense psychological craving to perpetuate cocaine use. There is no specific way to treat dysfunctional cocaine use; instead the treatment plan must deal with the individual's specific situation. Except for a reduction of cocaine supply at the source, preventive measures are only feasible in the context of abstinence from all abusable drugs.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence demonstrates that cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of psychotic outcomes, and confirms a dose-response relationship between the level of use and the risk of later psychosis. High-potency cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids carry the greatest risk. Experimental administration of tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient of cannabis, induces transient psychosis in normal subjects, but this effect can be ameliorated by co-administration of cannabidiol. This latter is a constituent of traditional hashish, but is largely absent from modern high-potency forms of cannabis. Argument continues over the extent to which genetic predisposition is correlated to, or interacts with, cannabis use, and what proportion of psychosis could be prevented by minimizing heavy use. As yet, there is not convincing evidence that cannabis use increases risk of other psychiatric disorders, but there are no such doubts concerning its detrimental effect on cognitive function. All of the negative aspects are magnified if use starts in early adolescence. Irrespective of whether use of cannabis is decriminalized or legalized, the evidence that it is a component cause of psychosis is now sufficient for public health messages outlining the risk, especially of regular use of high-potency cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is popularly believed to be a relatively benign substance. Cannabis is also considered to have potential medical benefits, and medical marijuana has been legislated in many parts of the world. However, a recent meta-analysis found that cannabinoids were associated with only modest benefits for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, small and inconsistent benefits for pain and spasticity, and inconclusive benefits for other indications such as improvement of appetite and weight, reduction in tic severity, and improvement of mood or sleep. On the flip side, cannabinoids and cannabis have acute and long-term adverse effects. In randomized controlled trials, cannabinoids increase the risk of total adverse events, serious adverse events, and dropout due to adverse events. Cannabis impairs cognition, and driving after cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents, including fatal accidents. Long-term cannabis use may lead to dependence, respiratory conditions, psychosis, and possibly cancer, as well. Cannabis use during pregnancy may compromise certain pregnancy outcomes such as fetal growth, and use during adolescence may compromise neurodevelopment, social adjustment, and vocational success. The composition and bioavailability of cannabis vary across preparations of the substance and routes of administration; this limits the ability to generalize the findings of studies. The findings of older research may no longer apply to current strains of cannabis that are higher in psychotogenic content. It is important for medical professionals and the lay public to understand the limitations of the efficacy data and the seriousness of the risks associated with cannabis use in medical and recreational contexts.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Club drugs are typically taken by groups of people during raves. Raves are parties where the opportunity to dance to very loud, rhythmic music while under the influence of one or more drugs is the primary attraction. Needless to say, most users of club drugs under these conditions are young and single. Club drugs are usually taken periodically; several of them may be taken three to four times over the course of an 8-hour rave, and then they may not be taken again until the next opportunity to attend such a party. This is quite different from the pattern of opioid, nicotine, or alcohol abuse, where drug-seeking and drug-taking occur several times per day for months or years, or from the pattern of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse, where the drug may be taken as frequently as possible for several days of profound intoxication. In most cases, even periodic club drug use does not continue for more than a few years. For all but a few individuals, there is little indication that it is difficult to stop using these drugs. Some of the drugs, MDMA in particular, lose their ability to change the perceptions of some users in interesting ways, and these people effortlessly stop taking them. For these reasons, club drugs meet the criteria for abuse, but usually do not meet the criteria for addiction as these terms were defined in Chapter 1. Physiological dependence on some club drugs is possible, as noted below, but is rarely observed in people who take them only twice each week.",

Whereas craving for opioids frequently has been conceptualized as the negative reinforcer of protracted withdrawal or “drug hunger,” craving for cocaine has been conceptualized as the positive reinforcer of remembered euphoria. Medications can reduce both sustained cocaine craving and acute craving induced by a single dose of cocaine, and reductions in both types of craving are correlated with reductions in cocaine use. Furthermore, high level of craving during treatment or during cue-induced challenges predict poor treatment response and later relapse to cocaine abuse in those who have attained abstinence.",

No strong evidence supports marijuana as a beneficial treatment for any psychiatric indication, however there is evidence supporting the use of cannabidiol (CBD) in illnesses such as epilepsy.

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking rates are much higher in people who are in treatment or recovery for a substance use disorder (SUD) and/or mental health condition. Dependence on tobacco is a medical condition, though one that has historically been overlooked in both drug and alcohol and mental health settings. Smoking has a negative impact on substance use and mental health outcomes and contributes to the shorter life span these groups experience. In this chapter the importance of understanding the difference between tobacco and nicotine is discussed, and the prevalence of tobacco smoking and its impact on the health of people with a SUD and/or mental health condition is reviewed. A brief overview of population-level interventions is provided and a detailed section on individual-level interventions to help people quit smoking.",

      "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Millions of individuals use alcohol every day; however, not everyone experiences a problem due to such use. It is therefore helpful to conceptualize alcohol use as ranging on a continuum from nonproblematic social use (e.g., a glass of wine with dinner); to alcohol misuse (e.g., a one-time incident of binge drinking); to excessive use or abuse (e.g., frequent use of alcohol that results in a negative impact on the life of the individual and those around him or her, such as recurrent driving under the influence of alcohol); and finally, to physical dependence or addiction to alcohol (e.g., a chronic disorder that may require medical detoxification and/or formal treatment). While not used professionally, the commonly used term alcoholism has been used synonymously with alcohol addiction and refers to the compulsive use of alcoholic beverages. Both terms imply a progressive deterioration of the individual’s social, physical, and mental status combined with the inability to stop using alcohol even when wishing to do so. Although the professional literature on alcohol use problems is extensive and can be found in almost every country in the world, the inconsistent use of terminology is often confusing. There are tremendous overlaps among literature on topics such as alcohol-related problems, risky drinking, hazardous drinking, alcohol abuse and dependence, substance abuse, and alcohol addiction. The confusion has been compounded by the changes in the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2013), which eliminated the previous diagnostic classifications of “alcohol abuse” and “alcohol dependence” and replace them with the overall category of “Alcohol Use Disorders” (AUD), which itself is part of the broader new DSM-5 category of “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders.” A fuller discussion of the DSM changes can be seen in S. Lala A. Straussner’s 2013 article “The DSM–5 diagnostic criteria: What’s new?” Journal of Social Work Practice in the Addictions. Research studies in the United States indicate a general decrease in the proportions of individuals with “pure” alcohol use diagnosis and an increase among those using multiple substances. Consequently, the topic of alcohol-use disorders needs to be considered within the context of the literature on problematic use of a variety of other chemical substances as well as other addictions, such as gambling and smoking. It also needs to take into account co-occurring mental disorders; age, gender, and sexual identity of users; socioeconomic and psychological issues; family dynamics; and ethnocultural factors. Finally, research and treatment focusing on AUD must be viewed within the context of governmental policies, which vary over time and in different locations.",

No es ajeno el contexto de rebeldia pero no de marginacion en que se desarrolla su consumo y que muchas personas que Io han tomado Io han dejado o ha pasado a ser aislado. Se considera, por tanto, algo pasajero, accidental, sin consecuencias y propio de una determinada fase de Ia vida o de algun momento episodico. Se ha planteado asimismo el papel dei cannabis en el tratamiento de algunas enfermedades o para minimizar los efectos indeseables de algunos tratamientos. Todo ello lleva a la necesidad de informacion sobre Ia sustancia y su entorno. Sus indicaciones, interacciones y efectos indeseables. No es facil, sin embargo Io que podria ser Ia elaboracion de un prospecto de utilizacion. Entre otros motivos porque falia la premisa de condiciones higienicas de fabricacion, manipulacion control de contaminantes y la notificacion de los problemas del consumo. El cannabis habitualmente se fuma. Sus efectos dependen de la amplitud y numero de caladas y de Ia concentracion de delta-9-tetrahidrocannabinol o THC en el cigarro. El efecto maximo se alcanza entre los tres y diez minutos y persiste de forma decreciente hasta Ias dos o tres horas. Por via oral, en forma de aceites, pasteles o infusiones, Ia absorcion es lenta e irregular. Es inactivado por los acidos dei estomago y su transformacion por el higado. El inicio de los efectos tiene lugar entre media hora y dos horas despues dei consumo y persiste unas seis horas. Se considera que Ia via oral es dos o tres veces menos potente que Ia via pulmonar. Tras el consumo de un cigarrillo puede detectarse productos de degradacion de Ia sustancia en orina durante una semana. En consumidores habitudes pueden detectarse en orina mas alla de un mes despues del ultimo consumo. El cannabis produce euforia o placer a traves de la dopamina y los opioides endogenos: bienestar, relajacion, risa facil, locuacidad, pero tambien ansiedad y pânico. Altera Ia memoria a corto plazo y la concentracion. Ocasiona enrojecimiento de Ias conjuntivas, reduccion de Ia presion intraocular, sequedad de boca. Por su efecto mitigador de vomitos se ha considerado de utilidad para hacer frente a nauseas debidos ai tratamiento medico de algunos tipos de câncer. Reduce el dolor, provoca somnolencia y puede dificultar Ia conduccion de automoviles. Incrementa Ia actividad motora, pero puede dar falta de coordinacion, dificultad en la articulacion de la palabra, temblores, debilidad y espasmos musculares. Aumenta el apetito, Ia frecuencia cardiaca, Ia presion arterial, Ia sensibilidad termica y la percepcion visual, auditiva y tactil. Da lugar a alteraciones en el espacio y tiempo y alucinaciones visuales y auditivas. Puede ocasionar alteraciones de Ia inmunidad, disminucion de Ias hormonas sexuales, aumento de la prolactina con secrecion de leche a traves de los pezones. Aumenta los riesgos obstetricos y de tumor de testiculo. Los recien nacidos de madres consumidoras de cannabis pueden tener bajo peso.

      "abstract": "Drug abuse and predatory criminality are behavior patterns that coexist in certain social groups. In other groups, drug abuse often occurs without predatory criminality. Among populations involved in drug abuse and predatory crime, a temporal sequence from drug abuse to predatory criminality is not typical; on the contrary, predatory criminality more commonly occurs before drug abuse. Drug-abusing offenders who display increasingly deviant behavior over time may eventually cross over a threshold to heroin addiction or frequent polydrug abuse. The intensity of their criminal behavior typically escalates substantially. If these high-rate offenders subsequently decrease the amount of drugs they use, they typically also lessen their rate of criminal activity. Among offenders who use multiple types of drugs, individual predatory crime commission frequencies are typically two or three times higher among offenders when they use multiple types of drugs than they are for the same offenders when they are in drug treatment or abstain from drug abuse.",

In most Western societies, at least 90% of people consume alcohol at some time during their lives, and 30% or more of drinkers develop alcohol-related life problems.1 Severe alcohol-related life impairment, alcohol dependence, is observed at some time during their lives in ∼10% of men and 3–5% of women, with an additional 5–10% of each sex developing persistent but less intense problems that are diagnosed as abuse.1\n\nIndividuals with alcohol abuse are not dependent on alcohol, but have repeated legal, interpersonal, social, or occupational impairments related to alcohol consumption.1,,2 They frequently use alcohol in physically hazardous situations. If individuals with alcohol abuse continue to drink, they may go on to develop alcohol dependence. Alcohol dependence is characterized by tolerance (a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve desired effect and/or markedly diminished effect with the continued use of the same amount of alcohol), and a withdrawal syndrome when alcohol is discontinued or intake is decreased. Alcohol-dependent individuals often spend a great deal of time using alcohol, and return to use despite evidence of physical and psychological problems. Alcohol abuse and dependence are commonly called alcoholism.\n\nDepression and alcoholism are associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and mortality, and co-occur more commonly than expected by chance.3–,8 The extent of comorbidity between depression and alcoholism was demonstrated by the results of several large epidemiological studies.3–,7 The National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a nationally representative survey in the US, found that compared with non-depressed respondents in the NCS, the lifetime odds of alcohol dependence were significantly elevated for both men (2.95) and women (4.05) with major depression.7 Conversely, NCS data demonstrated a two-fold increase …",

      "title": "Is the Outcome of Alcohol Dependence Treatment Related to Intelligence of Patients",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAlcohol is considered to be the leading cause of addiction in the world and its use over time does not diminish. Alcohol not only causes problems to people who are de- pendent on alcohol but also for a society as a whole because of its impact on health, welfare and the economy.1In Slovenia, for a decade or more, the officially registered consumption of pure alcohol per capita is around 11 liters. However, it is more realistic to estimate the pure alcohol consumption at around 15 liters because of the unchecked consumption of uncontrolled domestic production.2Harmful alcohol use is a transitional stage between a prudent drinker and a man who is alcohol dependent. Confirmation of the diagnosis of harmful alcohol use needs to meet one of the following criteria:3- repeated drinking prevents successful performance of the tasks at home or in the workplace;- the person drinks in circumstances where this may endanger himself or others;- recurring legal consequences, such as hardening of peace, driving under the influence of alcohol etc.;- repeated drinking despite problems in relationships caused by drinking.Longer harmful alcohol use may develop in the syndrome of alcohol dependence. Dependence is a medical condition in which a person, due to frequent, prolonged and excessive drinking becomes mentally or physically dependent on alcohol. The result is the typical behavior and thinking which is guided by a craving for alcohol and stick to drinking despite physical illness and adverse consequences in interpersonal relationships.3Treatment of alcohol dependenceTreatment may be roughly divided into three stages:- the preparatory phase,- the level of intensive care,- rehabilitation.In the preparatory phase a patient is deployed in a psychiatric clinic where psychiatrist performs ambulatory inspection and, if necessary, refers the person to check in to the clinical psychologist. The intensive treatment takes place in a mental institution or psychiatric hospital. »Length of stay« in the hospital is about 3 months. The second phase is followed by a third phase, which means the inclusion of the patients in the club for recovering alcoholics (in which their family members are also included) or inclusion in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).The goal of therapy is the abstinence. Patients who complete the treatment mostly return to the same environment in which they came up with excessive alcohol consumption, so it is important that the person after treatment is able to solve everyday problems without alcohol. Usually the patients are forced to treatment under pressure from family or employer and threatened with dismissal. During the treatment, patents become familiar with the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption and negative effects on their social life, cognitive ability and health. Modern methods of treatment allow a shift from inpatient to outpatient care but hospital care is often necessary, especially for people who can't establish abstinence in their own environment, have severe abstinence symptoms or mental illness or other medical complications, are deeply depressed or prone to suicide, or live in difficult social circumstances with weak support in their environment.3Intelligence in alcoholicsIntelligence is one of the major areas of psychological research. Most of authors understand intelligence as a general mental ability or general ability of effective thinking and problem solving, i.e. general intelligence factor.4'5General factor (g-factor) of intelligence is defined as a common denominator of all the components of our mental abilities. Spearman has an opinion that the achievements on tests of general intelligence are dependent on g-factor as well as the specific additional factors which he described as s-factor.4 Cattell introduced a division between fluid and crystallized intelligence.5Fluid abilities develop earlier and faster and are dependent on cognitive flexibility, adaptability and speed of information processing (e. …",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased considerably during the last 15 years. One of the major problems dealing with cannabis use is driving under the influence of drugs. With the exception of ethyl alcohol, the majority of the epidemiological studies have shown that cannabis is the most frequently detected substance in people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Experimental studies are therefore needed to assess cannabis effects on driving capability. Many studies indicate that cannabis impairs psychomotor performance. This impairment becomes obvious when high doses of cannabis are taken, when ethyl alcohol or other drugs are simultaneously ingested, or when sustained attention is needed. Moreover, cannabis effects are qualitatively different from those observed after ethyl alcohol consumption. In forensic practice, cannabis impairment of driving performance must be related to cannabinoids blood concentrations. To facilitate the interpretation of cannabinoids blood levels, several models were set up recently. These models must be further improved in order to fit in with all circumstances of cannabis use.",

      "title": "Causes of Drug Use and Methods of Legal Treatment",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction or use dates back to ancient times, with its roots lying in the human use of certain plants containing substances that alter mental states, perception, and sensations for thousands of years. These substances were used either to experience pleasure, alleviate the pain of a particular patient, endure suffering, or forget a painful life and its burdens. Drugs play a significant role in encouraging individuals to commit various crimes due to their impact on the nervous and sensory systems. Furthermore, drug abuse has become one of the most pressing problems and challenges facing our society, posing severe threats to families and youth and warning of potential disintegration. Regardless of the form or type of drug, it remains one of the most dangerous social issues and plagues that harm our community due to its profoundly negative effects on individuals, families, and society at large.One of the causes behind the prevalence of drug use is the high unemployment rate and lack of job opportunities within Iraqi society, leading to idle individuals who, with excess free time, may turn to drug addiction. Additionally, poverty becomes a bias, with the influential factor being the creation of a strong and urgent desire that drives drug users to obtain substances by any means and gradually increase their dosage. Other significant causes of drug use or addiction include family environment, bad company, working conditions, general social influences, or the desire to escape from one's social or economic reality. In some cases, sudden wealth among certain families may also contribute to drug abuse. As a result, drug abuse has become a focal issue throughout Iraq due to its destructive impact on Iraqi society. It is a primary factor in numerous social, security, economic, and health problems, leading Iraqi society to invest considerable energy and financial resources in preventing its spread and mitigating its effects on individuals and the community. This has been addressed through various legal and other means. The significance of this study lies in understanding how drug users can reintegrate into society as normal individuals without suffering from physical or psychological disorders resulting from drug addiction. This can only be achieved through understanding and addressing treatment methods and attempts to eliminate the causes of drug use or addiction. Officials must exercise caution and consider this issue to ensure that drug users are free from drugs and their negative consequences",

      "title": "Gangs, Drug Use, and Drug Selling in the United States",
      "abstract": "Gangs and drugs are two major criminological issues that come together in the United States. On the one hand, gang members use more drugs than non-gang youth, so much so that gang membership itself is an indicator that an individual will have a significant drug use profile. Compared with non-gang youth, gang members also begin to use drugs at earlier ages, use a greater variety of drugs, use them with greater frequency, and participate in other risk behaviors (e.g., violence, unsafe sexual behaviors) while intoxicated. Alcohol and marijuana feature prominently within the drug use repertoires of gang members, and the latter is considered normalized within gang cultures. Gang members also use other “hard” drugs, such as crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and heroin, despite the fact that the use of such drugs is stigmatized among them. Gang membership is also characterized by polysubstance use—the simultaneous or sequential use of a variety of drugs, as well as nonmedical prescription drug misuse. As a result, gang members are at great risk of many negative social and health consequences related to drug use. On the other hand, gang members sell drugs. A wealth of academic data contradicts the legal and public perceptions about this relationship. First, a commonly held view is that gangs control a majority of the sales of illegal drugs within any one area. However, this clashes with research specifically on gangs, which reveals that few members within any one gang sell drugs and that few gangs are specifically focused on selling drugs. Another area where academic research conflicts with widely held perceptions is the idea that drug selling is a lucrative endeavor for gang members. While the public and law enforcement agencies may believe gang members are making significant amounts of money selling drugs, research indicates that the majority of gang members who do sell drugs do not appear to earn significantly more money than they could earn working the same number of hours at a job paying minimum wage. Such findings further argue that such amounts hardly seem worth the risk given the large numbers of gang members killed or imprisoned in relation to selling drugs.",

However, it was during the seventies of the last century when there was a spectacular rise in drugs abuse consume, mainly by the supporters of the contraculture revolution. Recently this habit has been spread to all social classes and the age of initiation is being earlier, at younger ages. During the last decades heroin has been a drug restricted to marginal groups, a situation that however has changed in nowadays. Actually, young people is drinking an excess of alcohol and consuming also cannabis, cocaine and design drugs, specially during their recreational time.

      "title": "Cannabis: An Overview of its Adverse Acute and Chronic Effects and its Implications",
      "abstract": "In many communities, cannabis is perceived as a low-risk drug, leading to political lobbying to decriminalise its use. Acute and chronic cannabis use has been shown to be harmful to several aspects of psychological and physical health, such as mood states, psychiatric outcomes, neurocognition, driving and general health. Furthermore, cannabis is highly addictive, and the adverse effects of withdrawal can lead to regular use. These in turn have adverse implications for public safety and health expenditure. Although the cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) has been shown to have positive health outcomes with its antioxidant, anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, high-potency cannabis is particularly damaging due to its high tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), low CDB concentration. It is this high-potency substance that is readily available recreationally. While pharmaceutical initiatives continue to investigate the medical benefits of CDB, \"medicinal cannabis\" still contains damaging levels of THC. Altogether, we argue there is insufficient evidence to support the safety of cannabis and its subsequent legalisation for recreational use. Furthermore, its use for medicinal purposes should be done with care. We argue that the public conversation for the legalisation of cannabis must include scientific evidence for its adverse effects.

These stereotypes are most commonly rooted in historical racism, attitudes to poverty and the fear that these issues bring when associated with inaccurate and sensationalist reporting by the media. Crack cocaine is a different drug when compared to opiates and services need to acknowledge that national policies and practice have predominately reflected the needs of opiate users leading to imbalances in provision within generic treatment providers. The 'high' experienced by a person taking crack or cocaine is produced by a chemical called dopamine. The combination of increased adrenaline levels and low dopamine levels after a period of using can produce the feelings of being 'wired' or 'prang'. Crack cocaine use can be associated with high levels of health complaints, drug related deaths and also an increase in criminal involvement.",

      "title": "From heavy cannabis use to psychosis: is it time to take action?",
      "abstract": "Cannabis is one of the most widely used recreational drugs among people with clinical psychosis, after nicotine and alcohol. There has been a debate in psychiatry about whether or not we can infer a cause-and-effect relationship between the use of cannabis and psychotic disorders. In this editorial, we first present and critically discuss the evidence to date of the association between heavy cannabis use and psychosis. We argue that while the biological mechanisms underlying individual susceptibility to develop a psychotic disorder following heavy cannabis use are still unknown, heavy cannabis use remains the most modifiable risk factor for the onset of psychotic disorders and for its clinical and functional outcome. This demands a clear move towards both primary and secondary prevention intervention to reduce the impact of heavy cannabis use on the incidence and prevalence of psychotic disorders.",

      "abstract": "BAB 1PENDAHULUANA.Latar BelakangNarkoba merupakan singkatan dari Narkotika, Psikotropika dan zat adiktif lainnya BNN (2006). Narkoba pada awalnya digunakan untuk keperluan medis, pemakaiannya akan menjadi aman dan efektif apabila digunakan pada dosis tertentu, bentuk – bentuk tertentu dan juga pada waktu yang tepat. Narkoba menjadi disalahgunakan apabila digunakan untuk tujuan non medis seperti: mabuk, menurunkan berat badan dan menambah massa otot Anonymous (2006). Menurut Joewana dan Martono (2006) dibalik dampak negatifnya, penggunaan narkoba mampu untuk menimbulkan kesenangan dan juga perasaan –perasaan bahagia yang semu. Jika tidak, seseorang tidak akan mengambil resiko yang begitu besar untuk kehilangan pekerjaan, pendidikan, kesehatan dan lingkungan sosialnya. Efek yang ditimbulkan dari pemakaian narkoba adalah: hilangnya rasa kesepian, hilangnya perasaan – perasaan negatif, halusinasi, euforia berlebihan, mampu menggendalikan situasi, terbebas dari kejaran waktu, meningkatkan semangat dan rasa percaya diri. Apabila narkoba dikonsumsi secara terus menerus dan berlebihan maka pemakai akan menjadi bergantung / adiksi pada zat tersebut. Ketergantungan narkoba ini akan menimbulkan efek – efek negatif pada fisik dan juga psikologis jika pemakaiannya dihentikan, contohnya seperti: rasa nyeri pada badan, kejang – kejang, gelisah, sulit tidur, takut air, cemas, mudah tersinggung, melakukan kekerasan dan cenderung untuk bunuh diri Joewana &amp;amp; Martono (2006). Efek yang paling berbahaya dalam penyalahgunaan narkoba adalah menurunnya sistem kekebalan tubuh yang akan meningkatkan kemungkinan terjangkit virus HIV, hepatitis C bahkan sampai menyebabkan kematian (Anonymous, 2005). Pada saat ini penyalahgunaan narkoba pada kalangan remaja Indonesia menunjukan peningkatan. Berdasarkan survei nasional yang dilakukan oleh Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) yang berkerja sama dengan Pusat Penelitian Kesehatan Universitas Indonesia, pada tahun 2011 terdapat 2,2 persen atau sekitar 4 juta penduduk Indonesia yang menyalahgunakan narkoba. Dari jumlah tersebut 22 persen atau sekitar 880 ribu orang merupakan remaja yang masih berstatus sebagai pelajar dan mahasiswa(Anonymous, 2013). Dari data survei penyalahgunaan narkoba yang dilakukan BNN dan Universitas Indonesia pada tahun 2011 menyebutkan bahwa lokasi seperti Jawa Barat, Jawa Tengah, Aceh dan Kalimantan tengah angkanya relatif stabil bahkan khusus untuk daerah DKI Jakarta cenderung mengalami peningkatan. Responden yang mengikuti survei ini berimbang antara pria dengan wanita dengan kisaran umur antara 15 tahun sampai dengan 21 tahun yang masih berada dalam kelompok usia remaja. Hasil dari survei ini juga menyebutkan bahwa semakin tinggi tingkat pendidikan dan umur dari responden maka semakin tinggi juga penyalahgunaan terhadap narkoba. Angka penyalahgunaan lebih tinggi di kota dibandingkan dengan kabupaten dan lebih tinggi juga pada sekolah / perguruan tinggi swasta dibandingkan dengan yang lainnya (Nugroho, 2012). B.

People who take medical cannabis are also more likely to report medical and non-medical use of opioid analgesics, stimulants, and tranquilizers. Given that people who take medical cannabis and those who do not are likely to have different underlying morbidity, it is possible that medical cannabis use reduces prescription drug use yet prescription drug use remains relatively high. Studies comparing people who take medical cannabis with people who do not take it cannot draw conclusions about the effect of medical cannabis on drug use.

The purpose with this essay is to try to understand why people smoke cannabis. To be able to answer the main questions, five persons who smoke cannabis regularly have been interviewed. Information has also been obtained from prior research in the same subject and other literature. To increase the ability to understand and explain why the interviewees smoke cannabis the existential psychology has been used when the result of the interviewees have been analysed. The interviewees have said that smoking cannabis helps them to be able to relax and to calm down. They have also told things that has shown why they have difficulties relaxing. The conclusion of this study is that cannabis can be used to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. These feelings can arise when the individual stands in front of a choice in life or when he has difficulties in finding purpose and meaning in life. Poor self-image is the result when the individual is repeatedly dissatisfied with his efforts and this causes negative feelings to emerge. The individual can choose to try to run from these negative feelings by smoking cannabis.",

He likes to take risks and seeks stimulation; he has strong political opinions; he believes in punishment for law-breakers, but he is more likely to question it. He is not religious; he is less well identified with parents, and he has a lower opinion of their marital adjustment. He is not decisive about career goals; he is a fine arts or liberal arts major. He uses alcohol, sometimes in combination with marijuana; he first tried marijuana after entering college and is not increasing his use. The typical marijuana-user in the sample uses it infrequently, twice a month or less often, and is not likely to be using other drugs. The frequent user probably uses other drugs.",

Misusing drugs applies to legal substances, such as alcohol, or illegal substances, like cannabis or cocaine. In the popular imagination, people who misuse substances are often seen to be the agents of their own problems and are believed to be ambivalent about changing their behaviour. For many people who are dependent on substances, the greatest harm is not to others, but to themselves. The impact on the body of excessive alcohol includes cirrhosis of the liver, cardiovascular problems, the destruction of brain cells, increased risk of cancer and diabetes, malnutrition, and sexual problems. Many people use substances to enhance pleasurable experiences; others come to rely on them as a mechanism for coping with life’s challenges, often from a young age, and substance use can lend a temporary boost in self-esteem or social confidence. Drug use becomes misuse when someone becomes dependent or the use becomes problematic or harmful to themselves or others. Many people use drugs on a regular basis while maintaining their employment and continuing to effectively parent their children.",

      "title": "Análogos de las benztropinas como agentes terapéuticos para la adicción a la cocaína: Estudios preclínicos en modelos animales de conducta adictiva",
      "abstract": "La adiccion a cocaina es un fenomeno de gran importancia clinica y social. Las consecuencias negativas que produce el abuso de estas sustancias son significativas, incluyendo problemas medicos, psicosociales y laborales para los individuos afectados. Ademas, su abuso esta asociado a tasas incrementadas de crimen y violencia. La dependencia se caracteriza por tasas elevadas de recaida en un patron ciclico de busqueda y consumo. Estas recaidas pueden producirse incluso despues de periodos prolongados de abstinencia. Dadas estas premisas, uno de los principales objetivos de nuestro trabajo es la identificacion de farmacos que puedan atenuar el deseo compulsivo (“craving”) de consumir y reducir la incidencia de recaidas en animales experimentales. Ademas de mitigar el craving, estos farmacos deberian poseer un escaso o nulo potencial de abuso y carecer de los fuertes efectos psicoestimulantes caracteristicos de estas drogas. La busqueda de nuevas medicaciones para el tratamiento de la adiccion se ha centrado en la identificacion de sustancias que actuen como sustitutos de la droga estimulante produciendo efectos similares en la transmision dopaminergica y/o ejerciendo acciones antagonistas que impidan la union al transportador de dopamina. La mayoria de los esfuerzos se han centrado en el diseno de moleculas que mimeticen la union al transportador pero con un menor efecto estimulante y una accion farmacologica mas duradera. Los estudios presentados han caracterizado el potencial de abuso y e terapeutico de dos analogos derivados de la benzotropina (BZT), el AHN 1-055 y el JHW 007. Estas moleculas se caracterizan por tener una alta afinidad por el DAT y una pauta lenta y duradera de accion farmacologica. Para llevar a cabo el trabajo administramos cada uno de los analogos en combinacion con cocaina o anfetamina empleando diferentes modelos animales de adiccion a psicoestimulantes tales como actividad locomotora, sensibilizacion, preferencia de lugar condicionada (CPP) y autoadministracion (SA), acompanados de tecnicas de Western blot. Los resultados de estos ensayos han mostrado que ambos analogos no se comportan como estimulantes clasicos, mostrando significativamente menor capacidad estimulante a la vez que atenuan o bloquean completamente algunos de los efectos, tanto comportamentales como neurobiologicos inducidos tanto por los psicoestimulantes. Ademas, se muestran evidencias de que el tratamiento sustitutivo con el AHN-1055 como reduce la vulnerabilidad de recaida en individuos consumidores, apoyando la hipotesis de que pueden ser moleculas apropiadas para el tratamiento de la adiccion a los psicoestimulantes.",

      "abstract": "Craving, which ranges from a sustained desire for drugs persisting for weeks to an acute desire passing within minutes, has been described as an important clinical precipitant of relapse in cocaine and opioid abusers and may be a useful surrogate outcome for developing new drug abuse pharmacotherapies. Whereas craving for opioids frequently has been conceptualized as the negative reinforcer of protracted withdrawal or “drug hunger,” craving for cocaine has been conceptualized as the positive reinforcer of remembered euphoria. Medications can reduce both sustained cocaine craving and acute craving induced by a single dose of cocaine, and reductions in both types of craving are correlated with reductions in cocaine use. Furthermore, high levels of craving during treatment or during cue‐induced challenges predict poor treatment response and later relapse to cocaine abuse in those who have attained abstinence.",

      "abstract": "Domestically produced, high potency cannabis (often referred to as ‘skunk’ in the mainstream UK media) has become increasingly widespread in the UK. This paper considers whether the trend reflects an increased awareness of and desire for medical marijuana. Determining whether cannabis is a drug or a medicine depends on its objective physiological effects ‐ which may vary from one individual to another ‐ as well as how and why those effects are experienced. The medicinal and mind‐altering effects of cannabis are not easily separable for many cannabis users. The medicinal use of cannabis in Britain has waxed and waned since the early 19th century. Currently, the UK is at the cutting edge of the development of cannabis‐based pharmaceuticals, but criminalises people who choose to self‐medicate with herbal cannabis. We are living in a time of political, social and economic uncertainty, which threatens the stability of national healthcare systems. The broad‐ranging effects of cannabis on the human body and mind, combined with its relatively easy cultivation, make it a sustainable and effective alternative medicine. Research is needed, especially on the experiences of people who use cannabis to benefit, enrich and even prolong their lives.",

      "title": "Ingested poisons in adults",
      "abstract": "An ingested poison is considered any substance that's harmful to the body when ingested, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Any substance that's ingested can be poisonous if enough is consumed, even water. Poisons cause damage by altering cellular metabolism in a harmful or destructive way. They can act very quickly, within minutes in the case of heroin overdose, or over a period of time as with alcohol abuse. Most patients who've ingested a poison have minimal morbidity and fully recover within a short period of time. In this article, I'll discuss how to develop and utilize a general approach to the management of patients with suspected or confirmed poisoning. Unintentional or intentional? If a substance is ingested without intent to harm, it's assumed that it was an unintentional poisoning. This includes the consumption of drugs, medications, or other chemicals that are used in excessive amounts and result in an overdose. A poisoning is also considered unintentional when a substance is ingested accidentally and unknowingly, such as with children or older adults. When a substance is ingested with the intent to harm, it's considered an intentional poisoning, such as in a suicide attempt or assault on another person. When you can't make the distinction between the two because of circumstances, then the poisoning may be considered undetermined until proven otherwise. Substances most likely to be ingested include over-the-counter pain medicines, cleaning products, cosmetics, plants, prescription medications, and cough and cold preparations. Fatalities usually result from the ingestion of analgesics, sedative-hypnotics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, illegal drugs, cardiovascular medications, or alcohol.FigureTo evaluate a patient suspected of poisoning, you must discover what the likely poison is and when the ingestion occurred and assess the severity of the poisoning and the likelihood for toxicity. Nursing management is geared toward supportive care, preventing further absorption, and providing antidotes or promoting the elimination of the poison. Remember, the sequence, methods, and priorities of management are dictated by the poison and the severity of its presentation. The phases of poisoning are as follows: preclinical phase—some signs and symptoms may not be evident during this phase; the priority is decontamination toxic phase—signs and symptoms and lab changes are evident during this phase and guide treatment; the emphasis is on shortening the duration of poisoning and lessening the severity of toxicity resolution phase—this phase encompasses peak toxicity to recovery; the goal is to shorten the duration of toxicity. Initially speaking Your initial physical exam of the patient will focus on the ABCs—airway, breathing, and circulation—to stabilize him and prevent any further deterioration. Always ensure that his airway is patent; any doubt should prompt you to prepare for endotracheal intubation. Act quickly, but remain cool and observant. Signs and symptoms are important clues to identifying a poison, such as noticing there are burns on the patient's mouth. If the patient vomits, collect the vomitus and send it to the lab for analysis. Assess his vital signs, including pulse oximetry value and blood glucose level; assess and record his mental status and pupil size; obtain blood tests and urine samples as ordered; and make sure appropriate advanced cardiac life support measures are immediately available. Next, you'll want to confirm the history of the poisoning and correlate it with the information gathered from your initial survey. Sometimes you may need to talk with the paramedics, the patient's family or friends, or the police to gather sufficient information. Ask about the presence of pill bottles, medications, drug paraphernalia, empty bottles of alcohol, or a suicide note. If you suspect an overdose of medication, ask to see the pill bottles or the actual pills or ask for a description of the pills. If a substance can't be identified, call your local poison control center or check the computerized poison identification system or material safety data sheet. A computerized ID system gives you instant access to critical information about the management of exposure, such as clinical effects, range of toxicity, and treatment of specific and general categories of substances. A material safety data sheet provides comprehensive information regarding the physical properties, toxicity, physical effects, reactivity, proper storage and disposal, protective equipment, first aid, and containment process associated with a specific substance. Imaging tests may be warranted to determine the location, source, and likelihood of what was ingested. A chest X-ray may reveal undigested metals, radiopaque foreign bodies, or drug packets, vials, or supplies (called body packing, the internal concealment of illegal drugs such as heroin). Continue to assess the patient's vital signs, mental status, and pupil size repeatedly (from every 15 to 30 minutes to every hour). Check for the following: physiologic excitation (increased agitation, BP, respiratory rate, pulse, temperature, and pupil dilation) physiologic depression (coma; somnolence; diminished BP, respiratory rate, pulse, and temperature; and pupil constriction) odors (bodily or breath) acetone (fruity), caused by ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, chloroform, or salicylates bitter almond, caused by cyanide garlic, caused by arsenic, organophosphates, phosphorus, thallium, or selenium rotten eggs, caused by hydrogen sulfide wintergreen, caused by methyl salicylate. For more information about how to use assessment findings to help determine what type of poison is causing your patient's signs and symptoms, see Pinpointing poison's effects. Decontamination and antidotes After the patient is stabilized, some degree of decontamination should be initiated as soon as possible. Options include: activated charcoal to prevent further absorption (check for bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation, or significant gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding) whole bowel irrigation performed orally or via a nasogastric (NG) tube, usually in conjunction with sodium bicarbonate osmotic laxative solution; can be given after activated charcoal, especially if symptoms continue or if continued poisoning is suspected (check for bowel obstruction, ileus, perforation, or significant GI bleeding) cathartics, such as sorbitol, to decrease absorption by enhancing rectal evacuation of the poison; can be given after activated charcoal (check for bowel obstruction, perforation, ileus, electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, or renal insufficiency) administration of an antidote (see Common antidotes used in the ED). Table: Common antidotes used in the EDWith more severe and life-threatening cases, decontamination options include repeated doses of activated charcoal, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, hemofiltration, and exchange transfusion. Tailoring nursing interventions An important aspect of caring for a poisoned patient is understanding the course of management thus far and tailoring your nursing interventions accordingly. Ongoing interventions include: ensuring airway patency and assessing for the risk of aspiration, especially after any gastric decontamination process (make sure adequate suctioning equipment is readily available) checking vital signs and monitoring for hypotension or hypertension ensuring telemetry monitoring is intact and active (check for ventricular tachycardias or bradyarrhythmias with hypotension) initiating seizures precautions if necessary. After successful decontamination, a short period of observation will be warranted and a disposition determination will be based on the observed and predicted severity of toxicity. Mild presentations of toxicity may only require a short period of observation for 4 to 12 hours in the ED, but moderate to high levels of toxicity may require admission to the hospital intermediate care floor, observational units, or ICU on the basis of the patient's history and clinical data. Keep in mind that any concern for an underlying psychiatric condition should warrant a consultation. Discharge may also be hindered by predisposing factors, such as likelihood for assault or unsafe home environments, unresolved intent to harm oneself or others, inadequate support services at home, financial hardship, and concern over recurrences of unintentional poisoning (such as inadequate lighting at home, multiple medications, blindness, or physical disability). Calm, cool, and collected While the management of an adult who has ingested a poison can be a daunting and frightening experience, by remaining observant and knowing where to look and whom to ask for information, you can ensure a favorable outcome for your patient.

They may at some point have tried to stop using and, after somewhat longer or shorter periods of abstinence, have started using again. Not every drug user develops an addiction: addicts’ lives revolve around compulsive drug-seeking and use; they lose control over their own decision-making and end up relapsing. This occurs because addiction is a brain disease that can modify its structure and functioning, affecting the areas of the brain responsible for controlling our behaviour. Addiction is a public health problem affecting a high percentage of the population and leads to health, family, and work-related problems.",

Presentation of an aversive conditioned stimulus suppressed drug seeking in rats with limited cocaine self-administration experience, but no longer did so after an extended cocaine-taking history. In contrast, after equivalent extended sucrose experience, sucrose seeking was still suppressed by an aversive conditioned stimulus. Persistent cocaine seeking in the presence of signals of environmental adversity after a prolonged cocaine-taking history was not due to impaired fear conditioning, nor to an increase in the incentive value of cocaine, and may reflect the establishment of compulsive behavior.",

Effects of cannabis include impaired psychomotor performance, perceptual changes, attentional failure, and prolonged reaction time. Effects are dose-related.

Even when nonfatal, overdoses have a high potential for lasting health consequences. In the United States, the majority of drug overdose deaths are classified as unintentional/accidental. Drug overdoses can involve a variety of substances, ranging from prescription or over-the-counter medications to illicitly-manufactured drugs, and many overdoses involve multiple substances. In the United States, opioids, especially synthetic opioids such as illicitly-manufactured fentanyl, are most commonly involved in overdose deaths, followed by stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine. Drug overdoses disproportionately impact populations experiencing social and/or economic marginalization, and racial disparities in drug overdose are growing in the United States. Overall, drug overdose represents a topic of relevance for social workers engaged in research, policy, clinical, or community practice alike, across medical, behavioral health, legal, social service, educational, and child welfare systems.",

For instance, in the United States, reports documenting the medicinal properties of cannabis were published during the 19th century. Cannabis can be prepared and ingested in various ways. The leaves and flowers of the plant are often dried before consumption. Higher potency can be attained by compressing resin from the flowering heads of the plant to make hashish or by extracting tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with alcohol to make tinctures and oils. Increasing levels of THC in cannabis and greater availability of more potent strains have been cited as a partial contributor to emergent cannabis related health problems, such as increased psychiatric diagnoses of dependence and abuse. Although cannabis use and psychopathology are often correlated, there appears to be no conclusive evidence to suggest that cannabis use can cause mental health problems in the absence of other confounding problems.",

These frequent users are more at risk of suffering the harms associated with cannabis use than infrequent users. This report is an exploratory investigation into factors which might encourage regular cannabis users to stop or reduce their consumption of cannabis. The study results indicate that, while being arrested or imprisoned may discourage cannabis use, such measures are less likely to reduce consumption among frequent cannabis users than among those who use cannabis only infrequently. Frequent cannabis users, on the other hand, are more likely than occasional cannabis users to say that they would seek treatment if one were available. The study also finds evidence that regular cannabis users would respond to a shortage of cannabis, or an increase in the cost of cannabis, by switching to other drugs such as tobacco.",

The development of chronic tolerance to ethanol leads to greater and greater intake of ethanol, subsequent tissue damage, increased likelihood of more severe dependence, and the possibility of life-threatening withdrawal. The development of tolerance in the short term may encourage individuals to drink more per occasion in an attempt to recover or maintain the “glow” of the effects of alcohol experienced after the first drink. Whether or not this is important to the development of alcoholism is a matter of debate, but the existence of this acute tolerance has been known for many years. The mechanistic relationship of this acute tolerance to the chronic tolerance seen after weeks, months, or years of drinking remains to be elucidated.",

The effect of the drug obtained by smoking is more slack and mild than that by a intravenous injection, although the drug of the double dose is used in the smoking. Two cases changed the intake means from the injection to the smoking because of no guilty feeling and a lack of injection marks and evident proofs of illegal use.

At higher levels of intake, one of these harms could be psychotic symptoms and even cannabis-induced psychosis. During the last years, we have seen increased treatment seeking for cannabis use disorders in Europe. Parallel with this increase we have seen an increase in the incidence of cannabis induced psychosis in all Scandinavian countries and an increased population attributable fraction for cannabis on the prevalence of schizophrenia has been demonstrated. All this may reflect increased use of cannabis, but more likely increased content of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is most cannabis products. Many have also pointed to the fact that we have seen an increase in the incidence of schizophrenia in the same period, maybe attributable to cannabis use. If we also take into consideration that up to one third of those with cannabis-induced psychosis over time receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, we may see at least two implications. Firstly, these findings strengthens the evidence for a causative relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia, a causative relationship that man have suggested for several years, but that has had some opponents. Secondly, it points to cannabis-induced psychosis should be considered to be a part of the ICD-10 F2-chapter rather than the F1-chapter. This may be true also for the other substance-induced psychosis (F1x.5). An additional argument for this is that for no other psychotic diagnosis, a precipitation factor is mentioned in the diagnosis. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

While inhalation of smoke generated by igniting dried components of the plant is the most common way marijuana is used, there is concern over potential adverse lung effects. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent studies that explore the impact upon the respiratory system of inhaling marijuana smoke. Recent findings Smoking marijuana is associated with chronic bronchitis symptoms and large airway inflammation. Occasional use of marijuana with low cumulative use is not a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The heavy use of marijuana alone may lead to airflow obstruction. The immuno-histopathologic and epidemiologic evidence in marijuana users suggests biological plausibility of marijuana smoking as a risk for the development of lung cancer; at present, it has been difficult to conclusively link marijuana smoking and cancer development. Summary There is unequivocal evidence that habitual or regular marijuana smoking is not harmless. A caution against regular heavy marijuana usage is prudent. The medicinal use of marijuana is likely not harmful to lungs in low cumulative doses, but the dose limit needs to be defined. Recreational use is not the same as medicinal use and should be discouraged.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Though cocaine has been used by man for centuries for both medical and nonmedical reasons, a knowledge of its effect on the human mind and body remains limited and not yet clearly documented. Sources of information consist of myth, street knowledge, animal studies, and clinical and laboratory studies of man. This paper focuses on findings from the latter two sources. The biological effects of cocaine include the local effects of producing anesthesia and constriction of blood vessels in areas where it is applied topically. Solutions of the drug applied directly to the eye cause the pupils to dilate. Systemic effects include an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. In some individuals, an increase in alertness occurs, and in others a state of drowsiness. The drug also decreases total sleep, REM sleep, and appetite. The psychological effects of the drug vary with dosage, chronicity, and a host of other variables. Increasing doses over long periods of time appear to cause increasingly severe impairment of affective and cognitive functioning. These effects include a strong psychological craving, making cocaine one of the most powerfully reinforcing of all known substances. In addition, cocaine may induce symptoms ranging from mild euphoria to hyperalertness, hyperactivity, anorexia, insomnia, hypersexuality, and proneness to violence. In others, cocaine may produce sadness, melancholia, apathy, and various symptoms of dysphoria. Depression has been reported to occur in people who stop taking the drug, especially those who have taken the drug intravenously. At high doses taken over a long period of time, cocaine may produce symptoms that mimic acute paranoid psychosis with hallucinations, stereotyped behavior, paranoid delusions, insomnia, and proneness to violence. Finally, cocaine may cause delirium, convulsions, and death from cardiorespiratory failure. With over 30 million individuals in the college age group reported to have taken cocaine, college health personnel must be prepared to diagnose and treat symptoms resulting from cocaine toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Case: A 16‐year‐old patient is referred for major depressive disorder and cannabis use disorder (CUD). In the past year, she has been smoking marijuana three to five times per day, every day. Over the same year, her grades have declined and her relationship with her family has been strained in the context of increased cannabis use. Sertraline was started 4 months ago for depression and has been dosed at 200 mg daily for the past month. Her family notes improvement in sleep, concentration and mood with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The patient describes using marijuana, “because it's the only thing that has worked for my anxiety and made me not care about my depression.” She describes craving marijuana every day, especially when she smells marijuana on her clothes, smells marijuana on someone else, hears a song on the radio that she has enjoyed while high, or sees images of people smoking on TV. She doesn't intend to stop smoking altogether, but she doesn't want to feel like she needs to smoke every day. She has a history of occasional alcohol use (less than once a month) and occasional cigarettes (less than five per week).",

      "title": "Marijuana use: neuroscience perspective",
      "abstract": "The human behavioral repertoire includes activities that influence mood and cognition such as listening to music, watching movies, conversation, and dining, behaviors considered within the normal spectrum; however, when we choose activities that predictably and reliably alter our mood and cognition by exposing our central nervous system to exogenous molecules, we enter the potentially pathological path of addiction. We, and others around us, begin to worry as these behaviors insidiously become dominant foci in our existence. We do not clearly understand why a given individual chooses to use recreational drugs (1). As a society, we interpret and judge substance use based on our cultural prejudices, current moral and legal standards, and established norms.\r\n\r\nToday, with varying levels of acceptance throughout the world, the four, most abused, psychoactive substances are: caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis. Often, when individuals abuse one of these substances, they eventually migrate to using all four. Cannabis recently has gained significant social acceptance. People believe cannabis is benign, has few significant detrimental brain effects, and is also non-addicting. These are false popular misconceptions (2). Although the human brain naturally produces and uses cannabis-like molecules, referred to as endocannabinoids, current scientific data show that marijuana’s externally administered substances directly influence behavior by affecting brain functions (3).\r\n\r\nThe human endogenous endocannabinoid system indicates that natural substances that contain cannabis-like molecules will interact with the nervous system through existing receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are present in the peripheral cells such as the immune cells and neurons of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, cerebellum, basal ganglia, periaqueductal gray, hippocampus, and neocortex (4). In the central nervous system, these neuronal receptors play a significant role in modulating behaviors and brain functions. Data suggest that cannabinoid receptors play a more direct role in brain functions such as pain modulation, motor activity, reduced rapid eye-movement sleep, as well as mood, motivation, and higher cognitive processes (5). Their impact may combine direct and indirect cellular and network effects. The cannabinoid system’s neurotransmitter molecules are atypically synthesized in the cellular membrane by a complex enzymatic process of dendritic lipid metabolism (receptive and integrative structure of the neurons) (6). Although they behave similarly to classical neurotransmitter systems, unlike many other classical neurotransmitters, these neurotransmitter molecules are not stored in specialized vesicles. Current published data suggest that the endocannabinoid nervous system’s primary effect is to influence neurotransmitter release through presynaptic modulations. Endocannabinoid receptors have been characterized in two different receptor types, type-1 and type- 2 (7,8). Type-1 receptors are primarily found in the central nervous system, whereas type-2 receptors are thought to be primarily distributed to the peripheral system. Current data also show that type-1 receptors are closely associated with excitatory neurotransmitters. Based on how these receptors relatively distribute within a given system that contains inhibitory and excitatory neurons, type-1 receptor activation may cause either inhibition or excitation that may translate to physiologic seizure inhibition or facilitation, which is considered pathological neuronal activity (9,10). Receptor distribution may vary from person to person; therefore, based on cannabis use, we may expect individually defined, variable effects that eventually translate into unexpected behaviors.\r\n\r\nMarijuana and marijuana extracts are not only used recreationally: cannabis has a long history of medical treatment of various medical and neurological illnesses. Although recently it has gained the attention of research, the biochemical analysis of marijuana’s bioactive extracts is moving forward; this may give researchers significant understanding of the endocannbinoid system and how to develop new therapeutic agents that target that system. Already, significant advances have been made in managing chronic pain, glaucoma, head injury inflammatory disorders, and nausea, to mention a few (11).\r\n\r\nDespite marijuana’s tremendous medical potential, this drug’s recreational use presents medical and social problems (12-14). Recreational cannabis use has significantly increased throughout the world (15). As marijuana’s public acceptance increases, the age of marijuana exposure decreases. In the US, data indicate that while nicotine use has decreased among college students, cannabinoid use has increased. In the light of these findings, we must ask ourselves whether there are significant consequences for chronic cannabis use. We also need to ask about the frequency of cannabis use and its direct impact on brain function. In recent years, as marijuana’s quality has improved, the higher cannabinoid concentration has resulted in significantly increased potency. Cannabinoid concentration has increased up to five times, which has increased its biological effect on the brain and, more significantly, endangered vulnerable individuals.\r\n\r\nEmerging behavioral and imaging data argue against recreational marijuana use because they show a relationship between the age of first use and the intensity of measurable consequences. Individuals who routinely use marijuana have significantly altered brain structures and functions with significantly altered cognition and mood regulation. Relative to non users, chronic marijuana users generally underperform in memory and cognitive tasks; in addition, chronic marijuana users may develop significant mood deregulation that presents as depression, anxiety, and may result in long-lasting amotivational syndrome. Current data are unclear about the duration of these effects. More alarming data argue that some chronic marijuana users can develop psychosis that, in some cases, may lead to significant chronic psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders (16).\r\n\r\nWho are these vulnerable individuals? Although we have limited data regarding this issue, some trends are emerging. Indeed, it appears that a subpopulation of individuals may be particularly vulnerable to marijuana use. In these individuals, certain brain molecules have altered genetic regulation of certain neurotransmitters that include dopamine (17). This makes these individuals more likely to develop psychosis and potentially more vulnerable to developing chronic mental illness because these brain molecules help eliminate dopamine after its release. In addition to genetic vulnerability, it appears there is a well-defined window linked to age: Individuals who engaged in heavy marijuana use before age 17 are five times more likely to abuse other substances later in life (18). Furthermore, these vulnerabilities indicate that marijuana use may lead to future cognitive difficulty such as lower IQ and psychiatric symptoms (19).\r\n\r\nMany researchers would agree that pre-teen, teen, and young adult marijuana use may be significantly detrimental to brain development and, consequently, to successful participation in life. Emerging data show that chronic marijuana users performed poorly in school, often found themselves in conflict with the law, and did not progress as expected in developing their interests and careers. One proposed hypothesis states that marijuana use leads to decreased motivation and decreased ability to focus, pay attention, form memories, and solve complex problems. It is becoming clear that chronic marijuana use impacts emotions as well as cognition and affects structures such as the hippocampus, critical for memory formation and retrieval; the amygdala, critical for the emotional brain; and the frontal lobes, critical for the executive brain (20).\r\n\r\nLastly, but not surprisingly, recreational marijuana use and other substance use such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol may significantly impair the performance and socially beneficial activity of our youth. As the youth become young adults and attempt to manage new challenges and the responsibilities of independence, they often face significant periods of stress. Their successful transition through these periods requires cognitive and emotional stability. Without these resources, when they face challenges, young adults often seek easy immediate solutions. If substance use is in their historical behavioral repertoire, they turn to substances for relief and as a solution for their problems. These behaviors tend to be strongly reinforcing and often result in a viscous cycle of addiction. Unfortunately, we currently cannot predict who will withstand the challenges addiction, who will move-on unharmed, or who may be doomed to lifelong struggles and significant psychiatric sequels.\r\n\r\nIt appears we cannot prevent experimentation with addictive substances; however, we can invest in effective biological education about addiction and its potential consequences. We also need to have open, honest, evidence-based, public, conversations that address the individual risks of substance use and abuse.",

O individuo sob o efeito das sensacoes da substância quimica nunca esta satisfeito com a quantidade consumida, fazendo-o encontrar inumeros motivos aumentar o consumo da droga. A dependencia quimica e responsavel por problemas serios: desemprego, acidentes de trabalho, prostituicao, violencia familiar e criminalidade. Nao existe uma forma de prevenir a dependencia quimica, a melhor estrategia e nao ter o primeiro contato. E uma questao que vem aumentando no pais, em todas as faixas etarias, principalmente os jovens, isso angustia os familiares e preocupa os educadores, pois e nessa fase da vida que os adolescentes sentem-se mais atraidos ao uso da droga para a autoafirmacao no meio em esta inserido.  As formas de tratamento envolvem a interrupcao da droga, seja gradativamente ou rapidamente para alcancar a desintoxicacao. A utilizacao de farmacos e feito com medicamentos ou atraves de racionamento e moderacao buscando nao forcar uma abstinencia total da droga; o tratamento com psicoterapias pode ser realizado com ajuda em grupo ou individual. O tratamento aos usuarios de drogas e um processo longo e doloroso tanto ao usuario quanto a familia que acompanha. A enfermagem desempenha um papel importante durante a reabilitacao de usuarios de cocaina, mais tambem trabalhando com a familia passando informacoes sobre a dependencia e seu tratamento, orientando, encorajando e auxiliando nos momentos de recaida, desespero e angustia.  O objetivo do estudo e esclarecer a sociedade academica as informacoes necessarias para que todos conhecam o papel da enfermagem diante de casos de dependentes quimicos reabilitados e como deve ser tratadas.  A metodologia utilizada foi uma revisao bibliografica de livros e artigos academicos, excelente ferramenta fornecendo ao pesquisador a bagagem teorica de conhecimentos e o treinamento cientifico que habilitam a producao de trabalhos originais. A partir dessa pesquisa pode-se entender como e importante o papel do enfermeiro junto ao tratamento da dependencia quimica como tambem os efeitos da droga no organismo. Indices apontam que o dependente de tais substâncias geralmente possui baixa escolaridade, problemas psicossociais, na sua maioria desempregados e com passagem policial.  A enfermagem tem o papel de educador, para isso torna-se necessario a mesma nao manter nenhum tipo de preconceito para durante assistencia, assegurando-a sua realizacao de forma integra, eficaz e eficiente.",

      "abstract": "Older adults with long-term drug use have long been overlooked in both drug research and aging research. More knowledge is needed about their experiences and needs. Drug use is often seen as a youth phenomenon and as something that with time leads to destructiveness and compulsion. A more nuanced picture of who uses drugs and what the use may look like over time is necessary. There is limited insight into what it means to age with drug use, based on individuals’ own stories and experiences. We conducted 27 semistructured interviews in Sweden with individuals aged 55 or older who reported current and long-term drug use. In this article, we demonstrate how the relationship with drugs evolves over time and how the interviewees contemplate stopping or continuing their use. Three themes were identified: (1) Aging out of drug use: Thoughts on drug cessation. Some expressed a desire to end their drug use. The reasons behind this varied, but there was a clear pattern related to older age. (2) Aging with drug use: Thoughts on continued use. Some had a desire to continue using drugs and expressed concern about how everyday life would be without them. (3) Age adapted drug use: A change in drug use. Several participants stated that their drug consumption had changed over time and with age. Drugs no longer dominated their lives as before but still served essential functions. The themes should not be seen as rigid categories, but as fluid narratives. Understanding this variation provides a deeper insight into people's often complex relationship with drugs.",

      "title": "Nicotine Craving and Withdrawal: Impact of Cigarette Smoke Constituents and Age",
      "abstract": "Author(s): Reynaga, Daisy Dalila | Advisor(s): Leslie, Frances | Abstract: Smoking continues to be one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States. Although the majority of smokers want to quit, most will not be successful at doing so. Despite extensive research and funding devoted to finding more efficacious pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation, current therapies are not very effective at keeping smokers abstinent for over a year. The goal of my dissertation was to establish a preclinical test that would have better face validity for the development of new pharmacological therapies for smoking cessation. Current preclinical tests of tobacco dependence use nicotine alone. Here I used an aqueous cigarette smoke extract (CSE), which contains nicotine and many other constituents of cigarette smoke, to examine its effects on cue- and drug-induced craving, factors known to influence relapse. The hypothesis that was tested was that CSE would induce greater craving and withdrawal than nicotine alone. Adult male rats that had self-administered CSE were found to reinstate to drug priming alone, unlike animals that had self-administered nicotine, which required the additional presentation of drug-associated cues. AT-1001, a functional α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, attenuated drug-primed reinstatement of CSE- and nicotine-seeking behavior. However, AT-1001 was less potent in blocking drug-primed reinstatement in animals that had self-administered CSE than in those that had self-administered nicotine alone. This was the case even when nicotine alone was used to prime reinstatement in animals that had self-administered CSE, suggesting that prior CSE exposure had altered the functional role of this nAChR.Another factor known to influence relapse is withdrawal to smoking. Teenagers are especially vulnerable to the effects of withdrawal. However, although adult rats show many of the same signs of withdrawal as humans following chronic nicotine exposure, adolescent rodents do not. In this study, adolescent and adult male rats were exposed for ten days to nicotine or CSE (1.5 mg/kg/day nicotine equivalent) by intravenous injection. Chronic CSE treatment resulted in greater spontaneous somatic and affective withdrawal symptoms in both adolescent and adult rats. Furthermore, adolescents treated chronically with CSE displayed major affective symptoms, as shown by an increase in anxiety-like behavior 30 days after drug withdrawal. Mecamylamine, a non-selective nAChR antagonist, was used to investigate if nAChRs are involved in the enhancement of withdrawal observed following chronic CSE treatment. Whereas mecamylamine precipitated greater somatic withdrawal in animals treated with CSE, it did not precipitate affective withdrawal. Heavy smokers show an upregulation of nAChR through increased radioligand binding. Similarly, adult rodents show an upregulation of nAChR binding after chronic nicotine, adolescents do not. Since CSE exposure resulted in an increase in precipitated somatic withdrawal in adult and adolescent rats and also augmented nicotine-primed reinstatement, I hypothesized that chronic CSE exposure would result in enhanced nAChR binding in both adult and adolescent rats. Chronic CSE exposure results in enhanced α4β2, α3β4, and α7 nAChR binding regardless of age, in brain areas highly involved in negative aversive states of addiction. Overall, this work provides evidence that the cigarette smoke constituents influence drug-primed craving, withdrawal, and changes in nAChR properties. Smoke constituents eliminated the protective effects that adolescent rodents display in preclinical tests of nicotine dependence, and enhanced both craving and withdrawal in adults. These findings suggest that use of CSE is a more valid way to study tobacco dependence than nicotine, and should be used in preclinical tests to assess tobacco cessation therapies.",

      "abstract": "BAB 1PENDAHULUANA.Latar BelakangNarkoba merupakan singkatan dari Narkotika, Psikotropika dan zat adiktif lainnya BNN (2006). Narkoba pada awalnya digunakan untuk keperluan medis, pemakaiannya akan menjadi aman dan efektif apabila digunakan pada dosis tertentu, bentuk – bentuk tertentu dan juga pada waktu yang tepat. Narkoba menjadi disalahgunakan apabila digunakan untuk tujuan non medis seperti: mabuk, menurunkan berat badan dan menambah massa otot Anonymous (2006). Menurut Joewana dan Martono (2006) dibalik dampak negatifnya, penggunaan narkoba mampu untuk menimbulkan kesenangan dan juga perasaan –perasaan bahagia yang semu. Jika tidak, seseorang tidak akan mengambil resiko yang begitu besar untuk kehilangan pekerjaan, pendidikan, kesehatan dan lingkungan sosialnya. Efek yang ditimbulkan dari pemakaian narkoba adalah: hilangnya rasa kesepian, hilangnya perasaan – perasaan negatif, halusinasi, euforia berlebihan, mampu menggendalikan situasi, terbebas dari kejaran waktu, meningkatkan semangat dan rasa percaya diri. Apabila narkoba dikonsumsi secara terus menerus dan berlebihan maka pemakai akan menjadi bergantung / adiksi pada zat tersebut. Ketergantungan narkoba ini akan menimbulkan efek – efek negatif pada fisik dan juga psikologis jika pemakaiannya dihentikan, contohnya seperti: rasa nyeri pada badan, kejang – kejang, gelisah, sulit tidur, takut air, cemas, mudah tersinggung, melakukan kekerasan dan cenderung untuk bunuh diri Joewana &amp;amp; Martono (2006). Efek yang paling berbahaya dalam penyalahgunaan narkoba adalah menurunnya sistem kekebalan tubuh yang akan meningkatkan kemungkinan terjangkit virus HIV, hepatitis C bahkan sampai menyebabkan kematian (Anonymous, 2005). Pada saat ini penyalahgunaan narkoba pada kalangan remaja Indonesia menunjukan peningkatan. Berdasarkan survei nasional yang dilakukan oleh Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) yang berkerja sama dengan Pusat Penelitian Kesehatan Universitas Indonesia, pada tahun 2011 terdapat 2,2 persen atau sekitar 4 juta penduduk Indonesia yang menyalahgunakan narkoba. Dari jumlah tersebut 22 persen atau sekitar 880 ribu orang merupakan remaja yang masih berstatus sebagai pelajar dan mahasiswa(Anonymous, 2013). Dari data survei penyalahgunaan narkoba yang dilakukan BNN dan Universitas Indonesia pada tahun 2011 menyebutkan bahwa lokasi seperti Jawa Barat, Jawa Tengah, Aceh dan Kalimantan tengah angkanya relatif stabil bahkan khusus untuk daerah DKI Jakarta cenderung mengalami peningkatan. Responden yang mengikuti survei ini berimbang antara pria dengan wanita dengan kisaran umur antara 15 tahun sampai dengan 21 tahun yang masih berada dalam kelompok usia remaja. Hasil dari survei ini juga menyebutkan bahwa semakin tinggi tingkat pendidikan dan umur dari responden maka semakin tinggi juga penyalahgunaan terhadap narkoba. Angka penyalahgunaan lebih tinggi di kota dibandingkan dengan kabupaten dan lebih tinggi juga pada sekolah / perguruan tinggi swasta dibandingkan dengan yang lainnya (Nugroho, 2012). B.

      "title": "Cannabis: a self‐medication drug for weight management? The never ending story",
      "abstract": "In a society highly focused on physical appearance, people are increasingly using the so-called performance and image-enhancing drugs (PIEDs) or life-style drugs as an easy way to control weight. Preliminary data from online sources (e.g. websites, drug forums, e-newsletters) suggest an increased use of cannabis amongst the general population as a PIED due to its putative weight-loss properties. The use of cannabis and/or cannabis-related products to lose weight may represent a new substance-use trend that should be carefully monitored and adequately investigated, especially in light of the well-known adverse psychiatric and somatic effects of cannabis, its possible interaction with other medications/drugs and the unknown and potentially dangerous composition of synthetic cannabimimetics preparations.",

      "title": "Addiction: Rational and Otherwise",
      "abstract": "Addiction is a slippery, hard-to-define concept. The one element of addiction that is commonly agreed upon is that addiction involves “reinforcement”: consumption of the addictive good or activity today increases the desire to consume the good in the future. By this reckoning alone, caffeine, cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, opiates, gambling, sex, exercise, chess, listening to music, watching television, playing video games, eBay, eating Chinese food, reading, and religious observance are addictive for many people. Public policy responds mainly to those potentially addictive substances or behaviors that tend to bring on severe adverse effects: whereas some people read too much, the negative consequences of “readaholism” are insufficiently widespread or dangerous to make book addiction a pressing social concern. But the detrimental effects arising from excessive indulgence in alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and gambling, among other vices, foster efforts at social (and sometimes governmental) influence or control.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is a plant that could have therapeutic applications, although it produces a considerable number of adverse effects. Consumption in young people is high, and it is consumed at all ages. The administration of cannabis into the body is intrapulmonary, by smoking it. Its high absorption can produce different psychotropic and adverse effects. In our environment it is used for recreational purposes. This is a review of the literature published in order to describe the therapeutic and adverse effects. Its regular consumption is associated to a set of psychiatric pathologies. Besides, various adverse effects on other systems of the body can occur, generating social and public health problems. On the other hand, cannabinoids can have therapeutic effects. Some drugs are marketed for this use. Many experts are currently investigating the use of cannabis derivatives in different medical directions. Nurses are part of the multidisciplinary team, improving health care by developing educative and preventive abilities. It is necessary to continue investigating in order to determine not only its correct use in the field of health, but also its possible uses in the future.",

To do so, we account for common unobserved factors affecting mental health and cannabis consumption by modeling mental health jointly with the dynamics of cannabis use. Our main finding is that using cannabis increases the likelihood of mental health problems, with current use having a larger effect than past use. The estimates suggest a dose response relationship between the frequency of recent cannabis use and the probability of currently experiencing a mental health problem.",

Its defenders maintain that marijuana is harmless, or at least less harmful than other drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, while its more virulent attackers claim that it causes numerous sequelae, including birth defects more horrendous than those that resulted from thalidomide use. Much rhetoric has been expounded by both sides of the controversy. Unfortunately, even though there is ample evidence that cannabis is a dangerous substance, the extreme claims from both ends of the spectrum have tended to cloud the clinical reality of marijuana use, pharmacology and neurochemistry.",

      "title": "Growing Trend Of Drug Abuse And Misuse And Its Impact On Society A Case Study Of Hyderabad City",
      "abstract": "Drug abuse is the consumption of drug apart from medical need or use, in unnecessary or in excessive quantities.Drug misuse is the use of drugs for the purpose or conditions for which they are not suitable choice or even if they are suitable choice but used in improper dosage.The menace of drug misuse and abuse is increasing globally day by day and Hyderabad being one of the largest cities of Pakistan is experiencing this practice widely.Psychoactive drugs, sedatives, hypnotics, antibiotics, multivitamins, laxatives, heavy tonics, steroids, antacids, cough syrups and analgesics etc, are commonly misused and abused in our society.Among these psychoactive agents and antibiotics are the most frequently misused and abused drugs.Psychoactive agents have great potential for physiological and psychological addiction hence the users continuously use them to cope the situation of anxiety, insomnia, depression and pain. It has been observed that repeated use of such agents creates tolerance, which leads to frequent increase in dose of the drug.On other hand, misuse of antibiotics leads to microbial resistance ultimately leading to decreased efficiency of the drug in particular family or community.Self medication and over medication have become the norm.Self medication is risky and highly unsafe and at times dangerous too, it leads to misuse and abuse as well.Non-medically qualified people (Quacks / Store keepers) are not able to judge the correct use of medication or determine the dose, nor are they aware of the risks involved in drug misuse and abuse.It is because all the drugs which are available in market have great potential to be misused and abused.\r\nThe initially oobserved causes of drug abuse and misuse are lack of patient’s awareness regarding side effects or complications of drugs, improper patients’ counseling, prescriber’s lust for heavy OPD (because of which incomplete message regarding proper usage of drug is transferred to patients), wrong prescription (generated by unqualified people), prescriptions error, drug advertisement, busy pharmacies, easy availability of controlled drugs, dispensing error, pharmacies or medical stores being run without professional person (without registered Pharmacist), Improper follow-up of patients, lack of concentration of drug regulating agencies and unethical promotions of pharmaceutical companies etc.Lack of patient counseling has a significant role in drug misuse and may result in drug abuse or addiction.Prescription error is one the most important factor that leads to drug misuse and abuse.A prescribing error occurs as a result of a prescribing decision or during prescription writing process.Prescription writing skills / instructions should be according to the WHO guidelines which suggest giving the medicine to the patients in the proper manner by Pharmacist / dispenser / storing keeper.Many countries have adopted WHO guideline for the prescription in their health care system.The Pharmacist is the person professionally equipped with knowledge to understand all the drawbacks /complications of drug abuse and misuse and its harmful impacts on health of people.The objectives of this study are to explore the causes of drug misuse, abuse and their contributing factors in Hyderabad city.The survey study was conducted in different main targeted areas of Hyderabad city A questionnaire and analysis sheets were designed with the study objectives. W.H.O parameters (World Health Organization Guidelines / Standards) for prescriptions writings,Drug information hand book (Lexi-comp) and BNF (British National formulary) were used for evaluation of proper dose of dosage form and drug-drug interaction. Ms-Office 2007 and Statistical tools such as Mean, Standard Deviation, Cumulative Frequencies,Relative Frequencies, Chi square test, Z test, ANOVA, Regression Analysis, and Graphical Representation of data have been applied through the Statistical package SPSS17.0.Trend of sales at medical stores in Hyderabad city shows that sale with prescription is 41.6% and without prescription is 58.4%.It reflects easy availability ofvdrugs on large scale without prescription whereas on other side 49.4% of patients/customers were even not asked about availability of doctors’ prescription by medical store keeper.\r\nAmong the interviewed customers/patients male (62.4%) and female (37.6%) responded positively. It was observed that 29.1% patients/customers were between 31–45years ages. Maximum patients/customers without prescription (13.7%) were found in Pretabad, Hyderabad, on other hand maximum patients/customers with prescription (8.6%) were found in Saddar, Hyderabad, respectively.The available prescriptions (41.6%) were evaluated and categorized in four types.As Specialist prescriptions (56.4%), General practitioner prescriptions (19.8%),Hospital /Medical center prescriptions (15.7%) and prescriptions without name and address of doctor (8.1%); this includes non qualified persons/quacks as well. As the prescription error factor in drug misuse was considered the error was 30.6% in all prescriptions categories, whereas maximum errors were found in the prescriptions, which were without name and address of prescribers.Collectively 8.3% prescriptions were found very old and 11.8% were without date of generation of prescription.Trend of self medication is another factor of drug misuse identified on large scale in Hyderabad.According to data collected from patients/customers without prescription (58.4%), the decision of self medication, 55.8%, is influenced /suggested by self judgment, chemist, drug advertisement, friends, relatives,neighbors etc.and about 44.2% patients/customers were influenced by doctor.Majority of these customers/patients, 43.6%, were not clear regarding dose, frequency and duration of therapy.In 7.4% cases medicines were sold to 46 years age customers are involved mostly in drug misuse and abuse.Furthermore, 500 Patients/Respondents were interviewed in Out Patient’s Department (OPD) of a government hospital in Hyderabad to analyze the contribution of improper patient counseling factor in drug misuse and abuse.Out of 500 patients,\\159 (31.8%) were not counseled by any health professional, whereas 341 (68.2%) were counseled by the prescriber, store keeper/dispenser or both.Out of 159 uncounseled patients, the highest number of patients 76 (47.7%) were unaware regarding duration of therapy.On the other hand, among 341(68%) counseled patients, 218 (63.92%) were counseled by both prescriber and storekeeper/dispenser, 65(19.06%) by prescriber only and 58(17.0%) by store keeper / dispenser only.The underlying reasons for improper counseling may be lack of pharmacist in hospital settings, heavy OPDs and busy pharmacies. Since the calculated value Z = 9.7061 falls in the critical region, so we reject the null hypothesis, it shows P1 ≠ P2, at 0.05 level of significance and concludes on the basis of data, that the proportion of both gender (male and female) are different with respect to the drug misuse and abuse.\r\nAdditionally a total of 286 antibiotic containing prescriptions were randomly sampled from a government hospital.These prescriptions were categorized according to the antibiotic classes and errors were identified according to various standards W.H.O (World Health Organization) guidelines/standards for prescription writing.The extent of errors were calculated and the highest proportion of the prescriptions (89.86%, n=257) failed to demonstrate the patient’s weight and the least number of prescriptions (2.44%, n=07) contained the dosage form errors.The mean error per prescription was observed as 6.35 with S.D 3.138 and 95% confidence interval for μ is (5.98, 6.71).The major reasons were heavy patients’ influx, insufficient knowledge regarding prescription writing guidelines to prescribers and the lack of pharmacists. Continuous educational training programs regarding prescription writing skills, introduction of computerized prescription order entry system and by recognizing and appreciating the role of pharmacist in evaluating the prescriptions can substantially reduce these widespread errors.On other side 150 related peoples of health care systems (Doctors, Retailers/Store keepers and Pharmaceutical marketing personals) were interviewed to assess the role of these peoples in the eradications of drug abuse and misuse in our society.It was largely observed that there is lack of concentration, especially doctors and store keepers/retailers in the process of counseling with patients/customers regarding harmful effects of drug abuse and misuse on the health of patients/customers.Our results also found that majority of medical stores / pharmacies have no any criteria for dispensing the all types of medicines, which is contributing to easy availability of drugs and lack of concentration of drug regulating agencies at pharmacies/medical stores.This study will recommend the proposals for eradication of this social evil, which has been affecting the health of considerable portion of population in Hyderabad.The findings of this study will help Government to realize the importance of pharmacist in health care system and formulate the long-lasting strategy/policy to deal with problem of drug abuse and misuse and their contributing factors.",

Some have considered cannabis as a “gateway” to abuse of these other drugs [2], though such an evolution is by no means inevitable, since there are other users of cannabis who do not expand their range to include some of the other compounds.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of caffeine-containing beverages may be motivated to a significant extent by anticipation of benefiting from the stimulant properties of caffeine, though almost certainly more important is the consumer's acquired liking for the beverage. The latter is reinforced, at least in part, by the psychopharmacological consequences of caffeine ingestion. Crucially, this reinforcement appears to occur most readily in the context of acute caffeine abstinence, an observation which in turn is consistent with recent findings on the impact of caffeine and caffeine withdrawal on mood and cognitive performance. These findings indicate that 'withdrawal relief' or 'reinstatement' is a major effect of caffeine consumption in everyday life, leading to the conclusion that the actual or net benefits of regular caffeine consumption are considerably smaller than the felt benefits.",

      "title": "The Harms and Prevention of Drugs and Alcohol on Children",
      "abstract": "Children risk harming themselves when they consume drugs or alcohol, as these psychoactive substances are associated with numerous adverse effects on their physical and psychological health and well-being. Children may also be profoundly affected by the misuse of drugs or alcohol by the people responsible for their care, most often parents. This too can also seriously affect their health and well-being, and all aspects of family life can be severely affected by substance misuse. The potential harms to children are both short and long term, and may have irrevocable consequences, whether these arise from consumption by the children themselves or from the collateral harms caused by their carers’ consumption. The range of psychoactive substances used recreationally is extensive in type and strength and thus in relative potential harm. It includes opioids, cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco. Alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis are the substances most commonly used by both adults and children. Across the world, psychoactive substances other than alcohol and tobacco are widely illegal, although many so-called legal highs (Novel Psychoactive Substances) can be found in countries where legislation has not kept up with the pace of development of novel substances. Moreover, some legally prescribed drugs, such as benzodiazepines, may be used illegally without a prescription. None are without attendant risks. While alcohol and tobacco are widely legal, most countries regulate their production, purchase, and use, in part with a view to protecting children. A minimum age is usually specified for their legal purchase and, for tobacco, many developed countries now ban smoking in all enclosed public spaces to protect both the adults and children around the users. Broadly speaking, around three quarters of adults, outside “dry” countries, consume alcohol, so most children grow up in an environment where alcohol use by parents is normalized. Around a quarter of adults smoke tobacco, so proportionately fewer children are similarly exposed to parental use. Figures for adult use of illicit drugs vary, but around 1% of children probably grow up with parental drug use. This article addresses the use and known harms to children from legal and illegal substances. The readings included provide a selection of the available literature. For the purposes of these readings, “children” is interpreted to address individuals aged up to 18 years of age, including fetuses in utero, and the known effects of alcohol and drugs on this age group. However, the citations used may define “children” in other ways and may include age ranges that extend beyond 18.",

      "title": "SIDE EFFECTS OF CANNABIS USE AND ABUSE",
      "abstract": "Information on the adverse effects of cannabis has accrued over the past few decades in a piecemeal fashion. Unfortunately, systematic, well-conducted research on the toxicology of the drug in humans is comparatively rare. In most cases, animal studies are of dubious relevance to human toxicology, and this review concentrates almost exclusively on investigations involving humans. Most information has come from small scale investigations, case reports and anecdotal evidence. Many studies assume that the adverse effects of smoking cannabis and the adverse effects of oral or intravenous delta-9tetrahydrocannabinol or THC (the main psychoactive constituent) are equivalent. This is not necessarily correct since, as discussed in other chapters, there are many other cannabinoids present in the plant. In addition, certain adverse effects of cannabis may depend upon the route of administration. Smoking gives rise to very rapid, and high, plasma and CNS levels of THC. This, for example, produces a different quality of psychoactive effect to that produced by oral administration which has a slow onset, but provides more sustained plasma levels of THC. Smoked cannabis produces adverse effects upon the lungs which do not occur when THC is given orally.",

      "abstract": "espanolLa Drogodependencia es una epidemia en que existe un agente agresor: la Droga, una persona susceptible y un medio o entorno. Se consideran los efectos fisicos y psiquicos tras el consumo de Drogas. La adiccion supone la compulsion o tendencia impulsiva hacia la droga, en muchos casos como una necesidad fisica. El fenomeno de la tolerancia es el acostumbramiento a la droga de modo que el organismo necesita mayor cantidad para obtener el efecto. Las drogas se clasifican en opiaceos, alucinogenos, estimulantes, euforizantes, cannabinoides, etc. La utilizacion de drogas por las personas jovenes es un hecho frecuente, sobre todo el consumo de alcohol y marihuana. Ultimamente se ha incrementado el consumo de drogas de sintesis, lo que constituye una autentica epidemia en nuestro pais. Se ha estudiado las caracteristicas biopsicosociales por analisis de regresion. Se trata de varones, consumen alcohol y tabaco, con falta de creencias religiosas, con estado de animo negativo, con tendencias autodestructivas y sindrome de ruptura social. El tratamiento incluye detoxificacion, en el caso de los opiaceos con metadona, pero es muy importante la interaccion personal, lo que se logra en pequenas comunidades terapeuticas. Pero es fundamental una accion social para facilitar un medio ambiente propicio, con el soporte social, ya que el paro juvenil puede actuar como factor negativo, y facilitar la formacion para un trabajo adecuado. EnglishDrug dependence is considered a state of physical and psychological dependence which arises after administration of a drug. The drug itself determines the type and the extent of such dependence. Addiction means compulsion to take the drug plus evidence, in many cases, of physical need. Related to addiction is tolerance, or need to increase dosage to obtain a given effect. Drugs can be classified into opiates, hallucinogens, stimulants and euphoriants, cannabinoids, etc.. Drug use has become relatively frequent in young people, especially alcohol and marihuana consumption. In addition, drugs are often consumed in combination, being synthetic drugs a recent epidemic in Spain. Bio-psycho-social characteristics associated with drug use, as derived from a logistic regression analysis, are sex (males), alcohol and tobacco consumption, agnostic beliefs, self-destructive behavior, and social breakdown syndrome. Treatment approaches include detoxification, methadone, and personal interaction and behavior modification in small therapeutic communities. Lastly, social environments must be addressed to support social and work acceptance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Alcohol use has been in Nepal since time immemorial. Social tolerance to alcohol use is quite high and so far alcohol has not been taken seriously either by the Government or by any social organization. Production, sale, and consumption of alcohol is ever on the increase and it could be taken as the number one problem drug in the country. Cannabis and opium use has been in Nepal for centuries and in the past they did not pose much of a problem. Drug use began to be seen as a problem since only the mid‐1960s and early‐1970s with the influx of large numbers of hippies. Presently, the drug scene in Nepal is dominated by heroin and it has affected youths, mainly in the urban areas. A number of measures, both on supply reduction and demand reduction, have been taken by the Government together with non‐Governmental organizations. However, the number of drug users is on the increase. Relapse rate following detoxification treatment is quite high. After‐care and rehabilitative measures are lacking. Many drug users become involved in high‐risk behaviours in spite of their knowledge of the dangers. Therefore, it calls for the change in our strategies which must be based on the thorough understanding of human nature and its behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Indian hemp (lat. Cannabis sativa subs. Indica) has been used as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, medicine for some somatic diseases, and it is also used as a psychoactive substance. Cannabis can be used by smoking, evaporation, as a food ingredient, or as an extract. Acute and chronic cannabis use has been shown to be detrimental to several aspects of psychological and physical health and many experimental studies done on healthy people indicate the potential of Δ9- tetra hydro cannabinoid (THC) in inducing transient, dose-dependent psychotic symptoms, but also affective, behavioral, cognitive, neurovegetative, and psychophysical symptoms. Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug globally. In many communities, cannabis is perceived as a low-risk drug, leading to political lobbying to decriminalize its use. The wave of laws and initiatives to liberalize cannabis use continues to spread across the United States and the rest of the world, and there seems to be a political debate in the background about the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use. Aim is to present the possible consequences that the legalization of cannabis would have from the aspect of mental health and mental disorders.Authors reviewed the literature using PubMed resources on the effects of cannabis using the keywords: cannabis use, cannabis use and psychoticism, cannabis use and depression, cannabis use and anxiety, cannabis use and cognition, cannabis use and insomnia, legalization of cannabis.Authors examined the effects of cannabis use on psychiatric disorders and the review of the legal status of cannabis use in the world was also made. The possible consequences of cannabis legalization on the public health system were also considered, based on experiences from countries where legalization has already been done. The evidence cited in this article suggests that strong claims about the need to legalize cannabis are still questionable, and may, even in the long run, remain mixed, inconclusive, or even contradictory. Political interference in this issue can trigger a wide range of unintended but profound and lasting consequences for the health system and the health of the individual.We recommend further research on this topic and data collection with an emphasis on the effects and consequences of cannabis use on mental health, and in particular the benefits and harmful effects of medical cannabis use.",

Recent scientific research provides overwhelming evidence that not only do drugs interfere with normal brain functioning creating powerful feelings of pleasure, but they also have long-term effects on brain metabolism and activity. At some point, changes occur in the brain that can turn drug abuse into addiction, chronic, relapsing illness. Those addicted to drugs suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and cannot quit by themselves. Treatment is necessary to end this compulsive behaviour.

Drug-taking is one of the more widespread of human activities. The use, possession or sale of certain kinds of drugs, taking drugs in certain contexts, or the ingestion of drugs for disapproved motives, have been regarded as crimes in nearly all countries, punished with a fine or imprisonment of the offender. Drugs are commonly categorized on the basis of their impact on the central nervous system – the brain and spinal cord. In parts of India, for example, holy men smoke cannabis to quell their appetite for food and sex; in the West, the same drug is successfully used to enhance precisely the same appetites. The treatment of psychotic disorders, mainly schizophrenia, with the use of anti-psychotic drugs such as Thorazine, has been increasing dramatically since their discovery in the 1950s.",

Solitary abuse of one single drug, either hashish or opium, is the common feature of drug abuse in Afghanistan. 3. Abuse of other patent drugs as well as multiple drug abuse by the same individual, increasingly common elsewhere, is quite rare. 4. Self-treatment is a major cause of drug abuse in Afghanistan while escape from boredom and lack of work and motivation is another. 5. Hashish as well as opium is commonly abused by people of a low socioeconomical standard. 6. Alcohol, a more recent introduction by the upper class, is becoming popular among city dwellers with major risks involved for the future. 7. Drug abuse in Afghanistan has so far not created problems comparable to those in the West, although there is no guarantee that in future it will not do so. Coercive measures aimed at depriving an individual of his drug of choice may involve the greater risk of drug substitution which will then be an even more difficult problem to manage. 8. Factors involved in prevention as well as cure of the drug-dependent population in Afghanistan have been discussed.",

With increasing decriminalization and legalization, cannabis use is increasing in the United States and other countries. The adverse effects of cannabis are unclear because its status as a Schedule 1 drug in the United States restricts research. Despite a paucity of data, cannabis is commonly perceived as a benign or even beneficial drug. However, recent studies show that cannabis has adverse cardiovascular and pulmonary effects and is linked with malignancy. Moreover, case reports have shown an association between cannabis use and neuropsychiatric disorders. With growing availability, cannabis misuse by minors has led to increasing incidences of overdose and toxicity. Though difficult to detect, cannabis intoxication may be linked to impaired driving and motor vehicle accidents. Overall, cannabis use is on the rise, and adverse effects are becoming apparent in clinical data sets.",

Life threatening oral habits can be either tobacco involving habits or non-tobacco involving habits. Most of the life-threatening diseases occurring due to oral habits have aetiology of tobacco usage with few instances of non-tobacco induced. Tobacco whether consumed as smoked form or smokeless form, affects the human body in one way or the other. These habits developed by the body can be peer pressure induced, stress induced, can be due to social stigma or can even be a habit that once started as an adventure has now converted into a compulsion. Favourably there are various therapies available for managing tobacco abuse that can ultimately curb the deadly situation arising after tobacco use, hence decreasing the rate of occurrence of various preventable diseases as well as increasing the life expectancy of the masses. This review article focuses on the various tobacco and non-tobacco induced oral habits that can be life threatening for the human body, consequences of these habits, their treatment and management.",

      "abstract": "While they do not necessarily present the same health risk, such other problems as compulsive shopping and eating have similarly serious implications for both physical and emotional health. All of these behaviors share a common theme reflecting difficulty with impulse control. In some cases, identifying patients with impulse control problems is straightforward; the pack of cigarettes or nicotine stains are easily visible, or the patient's weight can be measured in the office. Other problems, such as alcohol abuse or compulsive shopping, are less observable. To further compound the difficulty with identification is the fact that physicians may not ask routinely about the existence of such problems. Whether a practitioner inquires about the existence of these or other impulse control problems may be related to the difficulty one faces when the problem is finally identified. Addictive behaviors and impulse control disorders are notoriously difficult to treat. High relapse rates and the frustration of both patient and health care provider when efforts to change fail are a testimonial to the tenacity of these behaviors. Recent research highlighting how to meet patients at their level of readiness to change a risk-related behavior offers a perspective on what clinicians can do to assist their patients in approaching and ultimately changing these behaviors. The stages of change model will be described as a method for conceptualizing how behavior change can be facilitated in patients with these various problems. In addition, issues relevant to making a referral will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "So what does this report tell us about the health effects of adolescent cannabis use? First and foremost, cannabis is not a harmless drug. It can be addictive and the risk increases the earlier it is used. Early and frequent use also increases the risk of short-term cognitive impairment and under performing in school, as well as psychotic symptoms and disorders. Cannabis use significantly impairs coordination and reaction time, so it is not surprising that it is the most common illicit drug found to be involved in car accidents, including fatal ones. And although we do not know the full extent of the impact of early cannabis use on long-term cognitive ability and associated educational and occupational successes, evidence is mounting that cannabis affects the young brain in a harmful way that cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nThis report presents an immediate opportunity to enhance youth drug use prevention and intervention programs, as well as emerging policy frameworks, with factual information and in a fashion that has been shown to work. We know that cannabis is not a benign substance. It has clear harms and poses risks to those who use it on a regular and frequent basis, including negative health, economic and social ramifications. It is now up to readers to take the information in this report and use it to help reduce the incidence of harms associated with cannabis use among adolescents, to help young people make smarter and more informed choices about their todays and their tomorrows.",

A large majority of the socially integrated drug users had taken cannabis in the month prior to the interview, herb much than resin.

      "abstract": "• Smokers (n = 315) who wished to quit were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to groups using either nicotine or placebo gum. Self-reported and observed symptoms of tobacco withdrawal were collected before cessation and at follow-ups of 1 to 2 weeks, 1 month, and 6 months. Self-reported and/or observed anger, anxiety, craving, difficulty concentrating, hunger, impatience, and restlessness were the most prominent symptoms of tobacco withdrawal. These symptoms had returned to precessation levels by 1 month except increased weight, hunger, and craving continued for 6 months in many smokers. Nicotine gum decreased most symptoms, including craving and hunger but not weight. Abstinent smokers with more intense withdrawal were not more likely to relapse. Abstinent smokers who gained more weight were less likely to relapse.",

      "abstract": "Khat chewing in the United Kingdom, has been largely confined to specific ethnocultural groups such as the Somali and the Yemeni community. In Europe, Khatchewing has also spread among members of the Somali community in Rome. The chewing of Khat is the most common method of use but it can also be smoked and taken as tea. The effects include euphoria, increased alertness, excitement with an improved ability to communicate etc. Various physical and psychological problems have been reported among Khat users. Strong associations have been found between Khat use and histories of anorexia, constipation, insomnia, headaches and respiratory problems. Depression and feelings of anxiety seemed to be less common although various forms of psychosis have been associated with Khat among migrant populations such as the Somali population. The prevalence of tobacco smoking is high among the Khat chewers in the London's study. Although illegal drugs are relatively uncommon among Khat chewers, cannabis use has been reported. It is considered that there are no physical symptoms or withdrawal of Khat or tolerance in contrast to the marked tolerance observed with amphetamine misuse. Despite the widespread of Khat use, few individuals appear to request help with their Khat use. It is clear that the pattern and perceptions of Khat use are changing among the community of Khat chewers.",

Caffeine has recently undergone scrutiny as a co-morbid risk factor with other substance dependencies, and in other medical and psychiatric conditions. Caffeine withdrawal also is briefly discussed with attention given to personality factors and the use of nicotine. Although caffeine generally is considered safe in usual doses, it is a substance potentially able to result in serious dependence. We cite a case which also illustrates that a supportive inpatient milieu may be necessary in order to interrupt a cycle of heavy caffeine use resulting in marked dependence.",

Addiction is often unintentional, and can even happen when someone accidentally misuses prescription drugs. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance followed by Nicotine, Cannabis, opiates or opiod drugs. Substance abuse and addiction have grave consequences on our existing social systems, effecting crime rates, hospitalizations, child abuse, and child neglect, and are rapidly consuming limited public funds. The intravenous drug abuser represents the fastest growing vector of HIV virus. Addiction is most commonly caused by physical and psychological changes that occur in the body and brain on behalf of drug and alcohol abuse. In today’s age of stress, a fast lifestyle, blatant media consumption and instant gratification, picking up habits like alcoholism and smoking is very easy. However, the addictive nature of these substances is strong, and it is fairly common to become dependent. The difference between substance abuse and addiction is very slight. Substance abuse means using an illegal substance or using a legal substance in the wrong way. Addiction begins as abuse, or using a substance like marijuana or cocaine. Person can abuse a drug or alcohol without having an addiction.",

      "abstract": "Substance and drug abuse is a major health problem that exerts a heavy toll on our society in terms of economic costs and human suffering. There is an unwillingness to recognise the distinction between the concept of illicit drug use and the realities of hard-core abuse. Addictive behaviour involves a wide range of substances. It includes abuse of or dependencies on nicotine, banned or illegal drugs, psychoactive medications and alcohol. Why do people take drugs? Since antiquity, both civilized and primitive people have used a near infinite number of chemical substances for such purposes as seeking pleasure, pursuing divine insight, escapism, and increasing aggression or strength, as well as the socially acceptable purpose of preventing or treating disease. South Africa is in a drug crisis, where substance abuse is now recognised as being the biggest threat facing our youth. The use of drugs by young people is a widespread and growing problem. Adolescent substance abuse is increasing at an alarming rate, and national trends indicate that the average age when chemical experimentation occurs is decreasing. Adolescence is a period of particular vulnerability. During the transition from childhood to adulthood, the young person has no real status in our society. Young people are constantly trying to achieve an identity and find new ways to handle the stresses of growing up. In order to fully understand the impact that substance abuse has, it is important to focus on the latest trends taking place amongst our youth. Cues for drug abuse identification Although drug abuse in its different forms can produce recognisable effects, those effects can be similar to conditions not related to drug abuse at all. Generally there are signs which may suggest drug abuse, and these may include the following: 1. Sudden and dramatic changes in discipline",

This is primarily done as a recreational activity. But, owing to the chemicals present in tobacco, it slowly becomes addictive in nature. Few smokers use effective smoking cessation aids when trying to stop smoking. Smoking is the most important single cause of morbidity and mortality in under developed, developing and developed countries. Because smoking prevention will not affect tobacco-related mortality, quitting by current smokers is the main way to achieve positive effects on mortality. Many smokers are interested in quitting. Most of the smokers try to quit smoking at least once in their lifetime. To support smokers in their quit attempts, a wide range of smoking cessation aids is available. These comprise methods and products to assist smokers in quitting through coping with psychological or physical aspects of nicotine dependence. Meta-analyses have shown that smoking cessation courses, nicotine replacement therapy, and bupropion can significantly increase success rates in quitting. Even minimal interventions such as self-help materials have a small effect when compared with no intervention.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is an extremely complex process that involves biological, psychological, behavioral, and cultural factors. Three factors that influence smoking and that are influenced by smoking are performance, stress, and body weight. We know that if nicotine-addicted smokers are deprived of nicotine, attentional and cognitive abilities can be impaired, and such deficits can be reversed if the person smokes or is given nicotine. In nonsmokers and nondeprived smokers, nicotine enhances finger tapping, focused and sustained attention, recognition memory, and reasoning. Stress results in increased smoking, but there is little empirical evidence that smoking reduces stress. Stress reduction from smoking is likely the relief of withdrawal-induced negative mood that is experienced between cigarettes. Smokers weigh on average 3-4 kg less than nonsmokers, and the weight-gain seen after quitting smoking also averages 3-4 kg. Changes in eating and energy expenditure are responsible for the body weight changes seen during smoking cessation and relapse. We need to know the full range of conditions under which nicotine affects behavior. The mechanisms by which stress functions to maintain nicotine addiction are not well understood. We do not know what interventions are effective in addressing the stress experienced during smoking cessation. Because no effective interventions have been developed to prevent weight-gain after quitting, research should focus on the concern or perception of weight-gain. We need to understand how and why body weight concerns vary across gender, age, and ethnicity because of the implications for designing effective smoking-cessation programs.",

It discusses the relationships between alcohol use and personnel security, the prevalence of alcohol use and abuse, indicators of alcohol dependence and abuse, the relationships of alcohol problems to other forms of problem behavior, and treatment effectiveness and relapse rates. About 10% of adult Americans have a serious alcohol problem. Excessive alcohol consumption may impair judgement and increase the risk of accidental, careless or even deliberate disclosure of classified information. Motivation for using alcohol or any other drug is one of the most potent predictors of future use or problems with that drug. If the motivation is experimentation, peer pressure, or adolescent rebelliousness, this does not necessarily lead to future abuse. To the extent that alcohol is used as a means of coping with life's problems, such as stress or low self-esteem, then one can expect that the alcohol consumption itself may eventually become a source of future problems. Solitary drinking is far more predictive of future problems than social drinking. So is drinking prior to social events(to relax), as compared with alcohol use at social events.",

Research on cannabis and the lungs has been limited by its illegal status, the variability in strength and size of cannabis cigarettes (joints), and the fact that most cannabis users also smoke tobacco, making the effects difficult to separate. Despite these difficulties, the available evidence indicates that smoking cannabis causes bronchitis and is associated with changes in lung function. The pattern of effects is surprisingly different from that of tobacco. Whereas smoking cannabis appears to increase the risk of severe bronchitis at quite low exposure, there is no convincing evidence that this leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Instead, cannabis use is associated with increased central airway resistance, lung hyperinflation and higher vital capacity with little evidence of airflow obstruction or impairment of gas transfer. There are numerous reports of severe bullous lung disease and pneumothorax among heavy cannabis users, but convincing epidemiological data of an increased risk of emphysema or alveolar destruction are lacking. An association between cannabis and lung cancer remains unproven, with studies providing conflicting findings.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol is frequently used in association with cannabis, with co-use now perceived as normative with expanding cannabis legalization.Cannabinoid products are increasingly used for a number of medical and recreational purposes, including to enhance alcohol-reinforcing properties or in some cases to substitute for alcohol.Rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) are higher among cannabis users relative to nonusers, with approximately 60% of individuals with current cannabis use disorder also meeting criteria for current AUD. 1,2Co-use is linked with heavy and problematic alcohol consumption, which in turn increases risk of alcoholrelated diseases such as alcohol-associated liver disease.Co-use is also linked with a number of negative consequences, including behavioral risks, 3 risk for driving safety, psychiatric comorbidity, adverse health effects, and poor alcohol treatment outcomes. 4However, the impact of cannabinoids on alcohol-related morbidity is not well understood, and findings on the impact of cannabis use on alcohol-related behaviors are equivocal.Cannabis serves both to complement drinking (i.e., increasing alcohol use), leading to more harmful consequences, and to substitute for alcohol effects (i.e., decreasing alcohol use and minimizing related risks). 5Beyond simultaneous (i.e., same-session) or temporally independent (e.g., same-week) co-use patterns, the substantial variability in cannabinoid composition (i.e., tetrahydrocannabinol [THC]-to-cannabidiol ratio), formulations (e.g., smoked, edibles), and quantity of cannabis could influence the direction of effect on alcohol-related outcomes.Further, individual differences associated with age and neurodevelopment; substance use disorders; 6 motives for cannabis, alcohol, and simultaneous use; 7 and the impact of statelevel cannabis and alcohol regulatory policies 8 could contribute to mixed findings on the risks and benefits of cannabinoids in relation to alcohol-related behaviors.This research review series approaches cannabinoid-alcohol co-use through the lens of complex interactions between biological, psychological, and environmental factors.Basic science research reviewed in this topic series highlights the role of the endogenous cannabinoid or endocannabinoid (eCB) system in alcohol-related behaviors.The eCB system, which regulates cannabis reinforcement, is also involved in modulating alcohol reinforcement, motivation to consume alcohol, excessive alcohol consumption, AUD, 9-11 and alcohol-related diseases.Emerging preclinical literature implicates exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists (e.g., THC) in increased alcohol consumption, with chronic exposure to alcohol implicated in disruptions in eCB signaling. 12,13THC is the primary psychoactive constituent that interacts with the eCB system, producing intoxicating, rewarding, and reinforcing effects in a dose-dependent function.Although THC is the most commonly studied cannabinoid that defines cannabis potency, there are more than 100 other phytocannabinoids and more than 500 constituents in the cannabis plant that also may exert different effects on alcohol-related outcomes.For example, cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychoactive, plant-based cannabinoid that has been implicated in the medicinal value of",

      "abstract": "Extract Epidemiology Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world with estimates that it is used by an estimated 162 million adults (4% of the population) worldwide. Half of Australian men and 40% of women aged 20–40 years report having used cannabis at least once and 20% report use during the past month. Similarly in the UK over 20% of people aged 16–24 years report cannabis use in the past year. Cannabis use is particularly common among young people, and there are concerns that this is a time when the brain is still developing and may be particularly vulnerable to potential deleterious effects. Many people experiment with cannabis, or use it casually, while a proportion (perhaps up to 10% regular users in UK) become heavy or dependent users. Pharmacology Cannabis is derived from the Indian hemp plant, cannabis sativa. The active ingredient is delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which produces the desired psychological effects of cannabis smoking or eating through a stimulation of brain cannabis CB1 receptors. However, there are other components of the cannabis plant that have psychotropic properties and especially in resin, cannabidiol is present in some quantities. Cannabidiol may have effects opposite to THC and one of the explanations for new preparations of cannabis (e.g. skunk) possibly having more deleterious mental effects than seemed to occur in the past is that they contain little, if any cannabidiol so the actions of THC are not attenuated. Different preparations of the cannabis plant vary in strength, and new variants (cultivars) of cannabis grown in new ways (e.g. hydroponically) have magnified these differences.",

      "abstract": "Interrelationships in the use of nonmedical drug use and tobacco use are explored based on self-reports by 165 medical students at an average-sized southeastern medical school. Lifetime and current use of drugs among these students appears consistent with earlier studies. Several background and demographic characteristics are correlated with drug use; higher rates of use are found among males, older students, and students who frequently miss classes. No correlation is observed between drug use and class standing, sibling position, social relationships, or family drug use patterns. Tobacco use was found to be low among these medical students but was highly correlated with nonmedical drug use. Drug use patterns appear to have developed in high school and college, and to persist, albeit at a diminished rate, during medical school. The findings provide little support for the belief that marijuana or cocaine use substitutes for alcohol use; higher consumption of virtually any recreational drug is predictive of higher use of other recreational drugs.",

Many of these adolescents have conduct, disorders, ADHD and learning disorders. There is some evidence to suggest that cannabis use leads to use of harder drugs. It is well documented that it produces acute cognitive effects that last for several hours after its ingestion. However, it is debatable whether it produces cognitive dysfunction beyond the period of acute intoxication. Language: en",

Different purposes of drug use are examined: the control of disease; maintenance of desirable normality; and the achievement of desirable supernormality. Drugs are most beneficial when prescribed by a qualified physician under clinical situations. Drugs such as Aspirin, the pill, or vitamin C. are self-administered by the patient, with or without advice from a physician, but tend to lose efficacy as a result of misadministration. Drugs such as alcohol, cannabis and heroin are often self-administered for desirable short term supernormality (e.g. euphoria, reduction of intellectual stress) but with long term detrimental effects.

That claim is increasingly in vogue, often supported by data showing the high likelihood of progression to daily tobacco use following experimentation and the high percentage of cigarette smokers, compared with cocaine users who appear addicted. In the context of criteria for addiction or dependence presented by the World Health Organization, the American Psychiatric Association, and the US Surgeon General, we consider several lines of evidence, including patterns of use, mortality, physical dependence potential, and pharmacologic addiction liability measures. Within each line of evidence, we compare nicotine with cocaine. We conclude that on the current evidence nicotine cannot be considered more addicting than cocaine. Both are highly addicting drugs for which patterns of use and the development of dependence are strongly influenced by factors such as availability, price, social pressures, and regulations, as well as certain pharmacologic characteristics.",

The psychologic reactions of aging persons vary considerably. The concept of growing older is much more satisfactory and pleasant than the concept of being old, since the former is applicable to everyone regardless of age whereas the latter carries a finite significance as deterioration progresses. Chronologic age is much less important than biologic age. The desideratum is not longevity but rather a long, useful and meaningful life. Although heredity is of importance in longevity, it is a factor over which at present we have no control. However, we can influence the aging process according to whether we care for or abuse the body. The principal factors in accelerated aging, in order of importance, are: 1) tobacco use (particularly cigarette smoking), 2) lack of exercise, and 3) obesity. Conversely, abstinence from tobacco, exercise within tolerance, and avoidance of obesity not only decelerate aging but result in a better quality of life.",

Factors affecting consumptionConsumption of alcohol depends on several variables.Sex-Although men are twice as likely to have alcohol related problems, the gap between the sexes is narrowing.Occupation-Alcohol misuse is more common in jobs related to catering, brewing, and distilling.In others, such as doctors, sailors, and demolition workers, high consumption is perceived as the social norm.Homelessness-About a third of homeless people have alcohol problems.Race-British Afro-Caribbeans and south Asians have lower average consumption and lower hospital admission rates for alcohol related problems than white people.However, pockets of high consumption exist, as has been reported among Sikh men (particularly of spirits).About a fifth of Chinese and Japanese people cannot drink alcohol because of an inherited lack of the liver enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.",

This disadvantageous decision-making and drug- seeking behavior may continue despite catastrophic personal consequences -- for example, loss of job, health, or family -- even when the drug is no longer perceived as pleasurable. A series of brain-mapping studies and neuropsychological tests conducted at BNL has shown that people addicted to cocaine have an impaired ability to process rewards and exercise control, in a way that is directly linked to changes in the responsiveness in their prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain essential for advantageously monitoring and controlling one's own behavior. Goldstein will describe her research in this field, which was designed to test a theoretical model postulating that drug-addicted individuals disproportionately attribute value to their drug of choice -- at the expense of other potentially but no-longer-rewarding stimuli and at the same time, experience decreased ability to inhibit their drug use.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a period in the life of an individual from 10 years to 19 years of age. This stage is marked by rapid physical, cognitive, and psychosocial growth in an individual and is a very crucial stage for their development. This is the time when the foundations of a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle are laid, and these habits may continue for a lifetime. Current research studies show high growth in the number of adolescents involved in risky behaviors, and this has become a matter of concern. The prevalence of risks in alcohol and tobacco consumption has increased tremendously. Tobacco and alcohol are known to be ‘gateway drugs’ as they are the first to be consumed when an individual starts such practices; the reasons are their easy availability, peer influences, acculturation, or even family history of substance use disorder. To decrease this and establish a healthy lifestyle, teenagers need proper information and guidance, including opportunities that may lead them to actively participate in interventions that are aimed to improve their physical and mental health. Mostly, alcohol and tobacco are seen to be prevalent together. Adolescents who show consistent drinking and tobacco smoking habits are more likely to show irritant, violent behaviors. Also, they are at higher risk of developing drug habits like marijuana abuse in their later stages of life.This chapter basically examines the generality of tobacco and alcohol consumption, especially among adolescents, and the ways in which it causes harm to adolescents and its side effects. It gives an overview of the social, physical, and psychological effects it has on adolescents’ lifestyles. It also covers risk factors and smoking and alcohol cessation efforts in the population. It gives special consideration to smoking cessation treatment, which includes peer influences, motivation, and nicotine dependence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Over the past few centuries, the importance of fitness has gained prominence. Coupled with this is the idea of thinness or the need to be slender and lean as an ideal body type. Thinness and fitness are not the same but are conflated in most messages about being fit. Many individuals, especially adolescents, have been influenced by the ongoing diet culture and social media. They have an ideal body or physique and are increasingly concerned about their weight, shape, size, and body image. As an attempt to lose weight and reach their goals, individuals go to extremes and try to starve themselves and/or excessively exercise, self-induce vomiting, or misuse products like laxatives, diuretics and enemas. Starvation or other psychological discomforts can cause one to binge-eat then purge and feel satisfied for a short period of time, but it eventually leads to selfloathing. This can severely affect the individual both physically and psychologically. As this cycle continues, an eating disorder is developed. Anorexia nervosa and Bulimia nervosa are the most widely recognized, and common eating disorders. Although there is little known about the pathophysiology of eating disorders, the evidence of eating disorders in the context of fitness and thinness, the potential genetic heritability, and developmentally specific age-of-onset shed some light on the aetiology of eating disorders. Research on various reactions of a brain neuropeptide called ⍺-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone (⍺-MSH), the gut microbiota and brain axis and, the monoamines- dopamine and serotonin aid in the understanding of the pathomechanisms behind eating disorders. This review aims to discuss the characteristics, risk factors, effects and the other features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. It also elaborates on the pathophysiology of eating disorders",

Por ello, es necesario analizar y establecer la relación riesgo/beneficio de políticas relacionadas con la salud mental, caso de la legalización del consumo de cannabis recreativo en adultos. El cannabis es la droga “ilícita” de mayor consumo en los países occidentales, en esencia por incrementar la sociabilidad y la euforia. En la última década, varios países han promulgado normas orientadas a legalizar la comercialización de cannabis recreativo en adultos. En este sentido, existe controversia del efecto de este tipo de iniciativas, en el porcentaje de personas que consumen esta sustancia y en la salud de los mismos. Sin embargo, se podría esperar que este tipo de iniciativas favorezca un aumento en el porcentaje de personas que consumen esta sustancia. El aumento del consumo de marihuana puede favorecer una mayor prevalencia de problemas de salud mental, incluyendo psicosis y esquizofrenia. Se acepta la existencia de una asociación entre consumo de cannabis y psicosis (incluyendo esquizofrenia). En este marco, reconociendo los beneficios de las políticas de legalización del consumo de cannabis recreativo en adultos, orientadas a superar el enfoque prohibicionista y a buscar la reducción del daño, es conveniente evaluar y definir el efecto de las mismas. Además, estas iniciativas se deben acompañar de programas informativos y educativos, orientados a sintetizar los riesgos del consumo, incluyendo, la dependencia y problemas de salud mentales.",

      "title": "On the duration of cannabis effects and the presence of THC in the body",
      "abstract": "When tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the most important psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, is present in sufficiently high concentrations it affects brain function. It is important to know the duration of this effect, both for medical and recreational use. New studies indicate that small amounts of cannabis remain present in the brain longer than previously assumed and accumulate with repeated intake. The possible consequences are currently unknown. To guide information-based cannabis choices, we call for further research. Cannabis use is increasing [1], as are the average THC levels in cannabis products [2]. The question of the duration of THC presence in the brain and the subsequent effects thus become more urgent. Long-term negative effects have been suggested to involve cognitive impairment, including memory, learning and impulse control [3]. Some studies indicate that this may have to do with functional or structural changes in the brain [4, 5]. However, most psychoactive effects of THC fade during the first hours after cannabis smoking and are mostly gone 6–8 hours after intake [6]. After occasional smoking of 30–50 mg, a common intake per day for recreational users [7], THC plasma concentrations fall from approximately 50–100 ng/ml at peak to approximately 0.5–2 ng/ml at distribution equilibrium 6–8 hours later [8-10]. Twenty-four hours after smoking, most users will have plasma levels below 1 ng/ml and below the detection limit of several analytical methods (often 0.5 ng/ml). This could give the impression that THC is no longer present in the body. However, with an ultrasensitive analytical method, THC plasma levels have been detected for 10–28 days after smoking of approximately 30 mg THC on 2 consecutive days in an experimental study [11]. That study estimated the terminal half-life (T½) of THC in 10 subjects to be 4.3 (2.6–12.6) days. Recent population pharmacokinetic studies have reported a mean T½ of THC from 21.5 hours to 3.5 days [10, 12, 13]. According to general pharmacokinetic principles, the THC plasma concentration after a period of 5 T½ will be 3% of the level at distribution equilibrium. Taken together, these findings suggest that THC may be present in low concentrations from 5 to 60 days. An important question is whether these very low THC levels, which are comparable with the human plasma levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide [14], will be interfering with the brain function through an impact on the endocannabinoid systems. Repeated smoking within this period would lead to accumulated THC levels and probably increase the risk of interference. The duration of the low-concentration period shows marked individual differences in naturalistic studies of frequent smokers [15-18] and in less frequent cannabis smokers [19]. The reason for this variation in T½ is currently unknown, but could be dependent upon analytical methodology or biopharmacological factors such as gender, age, body mass index, pattern of use and drug interactions. In our opinion, data on the fate of THC in the human body expressed as comprehensive information on its T½, and similar to that required for medicinal drugs, should be available also to all users of cannabis. No external funding was necessary for this work. J.M. has acted as consultant for the Norwegian Ministry of Transportation and Communication and the police on concentration limits for drugs in drivers and as expert witness in Norwegian courts in cases on cannabis impairment.

      "abstract": "Cannabis, or Marijuana, remains one of the most universally used recreational drugs. Over the last four decades, its popularity has risen considerably as it became easily accessible and relatively affordable. Peak use is amongst the young aged 18 to 25 years, although these figures are now shifting towards earlier teens. A strongly installed culture still regards cannabis a harmless drug, yet as more reports have shown there are considerable adverse cardiovascular events linked with its use. In this paper, we present the case of a 15-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest following cannabis use and survived the episode. Cardiac arrest is a rare and possibly fatal consequence of cannabis use. Public awareness should be raised by extensively promoting all potential complications associated with its use.",

      "abstract": "A majority of individuals in India engage themselves in daily consumption despite the prominent warning labels on tobacco chewing products such as “Tobacco is injurious to health and tobacco kills”, “Tobacco causes painful death”, and “Tobacco users die younger”. Tobacco kills over 8 million people annually and is readily available at a meagre price in our country. Its nicotine content makes it a potent and highly addictive substance. Once an individual becomes hooked on nicotine, breaking free becomes a challenge due to the relentless grip of withdrawal symptoms and insatiable cravings. Tobacco has become a coping mechanism to help an individual navigate the stress, anxiety and emotional turmoil of life. This reliance bows to a psychological dependence that's hard to escape. Hence, the repeated and continued use of tobacco results in addiction. Its usage poses serious health risks, and there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco. From its origin in America to its global spread, tobacco’s legacy is complex and complicated. The modern-day challenges of regulations and health issues continue to evolve as society balances the interests of public health, economic considerations and an individual's freedom. In Ayurveda, Tobacco was first described as Tamakhu by Aacharya Yogratnakara in the 17th century. Combating this global threat is essential to save lives and improve public health. The need of the hour is to create awareness, which can help in decreasing the harmful effects of long-term consumption of tobacco.",

Smokers mostly acknowledge the harm they are doing to themselves and many report that they do not enjoy it – yet they continue to smoke. Smoking behavior is maintained primarily by the positive and negative reinforcing properties of nicotine delivered rapidly in a way that is affordable and palatable, with the negative health consequences mostly being sufficiently uncertain and distant in time not to create sufficient immediate concern to deter the behavior. Tobacco smoking increases the risk of contracting a wide range of diseases, many of which are fatal. Despite reductions in prevalence in recent years, tobacco smoking remains one of the main preventable causes of ill-health and premature death worldwide. This paper reviews the source, history and epidemiology of tobacco use, extent and nature of harms caused by tobacco use – both active and passive and the benefits of stopping.&#x0D; Journal of Armed Forces Medical College Bangladesh Vol.15 (1) 2019: 102-106",

It is worse in smokers with higher nicotine intake and can be reduced by a nicotine substitute. Although it may occur at any time during abstinence, it can be increased by stress and boredom and reduced when the smoker is kept occupied. Craving for cigarettes probably has multiple causation arising partly out of the perceived benefits of smoking and negative consequences of not smoking and partly as a direct result of loss of nicotine. Whatever its root causes it would be expected to involve general psychological processes such as associative learning and attribution. This paper draws together the threads of pharmacological and psychological levels of explanation for cigarette craving in an attempt to provide a clearer understanding of this phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "SummaryIn a study of 249 opiate (mainly heroin) addicts special attention was paid to adjunctive drug use. Generally, nicotine (cigarette smoking), alcohol and cannabis preceded the use of heroin, and continued to be used as adjunctive drugs after the establishment of heroin addiction. Nicotine was the most common substance used together with opiates. Alcohol and cannabis were used as adjunctive drugs in about two-thirds of the cases. In the late stages of heroin addiction, benzo-diazepines were also used concomitantly with opiates. The most frequently reported reason for the use of adjunctive drugs was to intensify the effect of the opiate. Three-quarters or more of the addicts had used different adjunctive drugs to boost the euphoric feeling derived from the primary drug, i.e. heroin. Attempt at self-treatment of withdrawal symptoms was a less frequently reported reason for adjunctive drug use. The findings show that heroin addiction is the major problem. The use of adjunctive drugs, especially benzodiazepines, can be partly explained on economic grounds. They must be clearly distinguished from the primary drug of abuse, heroin. For policy-making decisions, it is important that the elimination of heroin abuse through effective prevention measures would ultimately wipe out the problem of adjunctive drug use, while reduction of the overall supply of heroin without reduction in actual demand might result in an increasing trend to adjunctive drug use.Key Words:: Drug dependenceheroin addictionnarcoticscannabisalcoholbenzodiazepinesMalaysia",

A number of studies have found association between cannabis use and suicide, but the quality of control for confounding variables has varied widely. There is increasing evidence that regular cannabis use and depression occur together more often than we might expect by chance. The association between cannabis use and depression may arise because the same factors that predispose people to use cannabis also increase their risk of depression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have provided mixed evidence on the association between cannabis use and depression. There is a need for longitudinal and twin studies that assess the relationship between cannabis use, depression and confounding factors.",

      "title": "Effects of Cannabis Exposure on Adolescent Health and Development: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is an immature but adventurous time period of exploration. Due to rapid developments of the brain with unbalanced release of neurotransmitters, adolescents are prone to impulsivity that may carry out potentially dangerous behaviors. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of high school students have reported the use of cannabis or marijuana in 2019, and the trend has not declined since. Previous studies have shown that cannabis not only affects cognitive and social behaviors, but also produces psychological responses to stress. In this review, we have summarized recent studies on cannabis- produced effects during the unique period of adolescent development, and we have also briefly discussed the legalization of cannabis. Though there are slight differences between cannabis and marijuana, the major active component of them is tetrahydrocannabinol. We have used the term \"cannabis\" in this review. Cannabis use in adolescents causes structural and functional changes in the brain, increasing the probability of depression, which is also associated with other illicit substance use, and impairs education achievement. Given that cannabis use can cause detrimental harm to adolescents, it is suggested that adolescents should generally avoid using cannabis in a recreational manner. More preclinical and clinical studies are needed to provide detailed information for evidence-based decisions.",

ECIG-induced nicotine dependence has become an important concern, as some ECIGs deliver very little nicotine while some may exceed the nicotine delivery profile of a tobacco cigarette. This variability is relevant to tobacco cigarette smokers who try to switch to ECIGs. Products with very low nicotine delivery may not substitute for tobacco cigarettes, so that ECIG use is accompanied by little reduced risk of cigarette-caused disease. Products with very high nicotine delivery may make quitting ECIGs particularly difficult should users decide to try. For non-smokers, the wide variability of ECIGs on the market is especially troublesome: low nicotine products may lead them to initiate nicotine self-administration and progress to higher dosing ECIGs or other products, and those that deliver more nicotine may produce nicotine dependence where it was not otherwise present. External regulatory action, guided by strong science, may be required to ensure that population-level nicotine dependence does not rise.",

      "abstract": "SMOKING, now recognized as a foremost environmental hazard to health, may be performed in diverse ways — making it difficult for investigators to quantitate and compare the effective exposure to tobacco smoke resulting from smoking of cigarettes, pipes or cigars in various ways at various ages. Cigarettes may be long or short, with filters or without and inhaled deeply or hardly at all, and may be discarded after a few puffs or smoked to a very short butt. The number of cigarettes, pipefuls or cigars smoked per unit of time is, by itself, an inadequate index to the effective exposure . . .",

      "title": "Review on Selected Toxic, Narcotics and Psychoactive Plants Used in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "One in seven Nigerians aged 15 to 64 had used illicit substances (other than tobacco and alcohol) in the past year, with significant numbers suffering from drug-related disorders. Cannabis, known as marijuana or Indian hemp, contains THC, which affects brain receptors. Short-term effects include mood swings, memory loss, and poor coordination, while regular use can lead to anxiety, depression, and respiratory problems. Nigeria has strict laws against cannabis use, with severe penalties for possession and distribution. Tobacco is widely used for its nicotine content. Short-term effects include high blood pressure and increased heart rate, while long-term use can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Smoking is legal in Nigeria, but there are efforts to reduce tobacco usage through taxes and health campaigns. Khat, or miraa, contains cathinone, causing similar short-term effects as tobacco. Though illegal in Nigeria, it remains used in some Northern communities. Datura stramonium, or jimsonweed, contains harmful substances that can cause hallucinations. Its use is also illegal in Nigeria, its traditional medicine practices can be risky despite potential benefits. The purpose of this review is to develop a review of current research on toxic, narcotic, psychoactive plants and ecological risk assessment, as well as to point out deficiencies and to offer motivation for enhancing the research level in this field. Research on psychoactive plants is being conducted progressively, and significant progress has been made in the aspects of occurrence. Nevertheless, there are some areas for improvement and more research needs be carried on the selected plants as well as other plants in existence.",

      "title": "Caffeinated energy drink consumption among adolescents and potential health consequences associated with their use: a significant public health hazard.",
      "abstract": "Caffeinated energy drinks (EDs) are increasingly popular among adolescents despite growing evidence of their negative health effects. The consumption of EDs has seen a substantial increase during the past few decades, especially in the Western and Asian countries. EDs contain high levels of caffeine, sugar, and novel ingredients, and are often marketed through youth-oriented media and venues. The known and unknown pharmacology of the constituents of EDs poses a risk of caffeine toxicity and other ill effects when consumed by young people. Caffeine intoxication may result in tachycardia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even death. Other health concerns related to consumption of EDs include obesity and dental enamel erosion resulting from the acidity of EDs. Coingestion of caffeine and ethanol has been associated with increased risk-taking behaviors in adolescent users, impaired driving, and increased use of other illicit substances. Several researchers have demonstrated that consuming alcohol mixed with energy drinks leads to altered subjective states including decreased perceived intoxication, enhanced stimulation, and increased desire to drink/increased drinking compared to consuming alcohol alone. Caffeine's effect on intoxication may be most pronounced when mixers are artificially sweetened, that is, lack sucrose which slows the rate of gastric emptying of alcohol.1) health care providers should educate youth and their parents about the risks of caffeinated drinks; 2) emergency department clinicians should consider asking patients about ED and traditional caffeine usage and substance use when assessing patient symptoms; 3) policy makers should increase their attention on introducing regulatory policies on television food advertising to which youth are exposed; 4) failure to comply with standards for efficacious product labelling, and absence of broader education regarding guidelines, need to be addressed and 5) further studies must be done to improve our understanding of potential negative consequences of caffeinated energy drinks on health.",

      "title": "Cotinine: Beyond that Expected, More than a Biomarker of Tobacco Consumption",
      "abstract": "A greater incidence of tobacco consumption occurs among individuals with psychiatric conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia, compared with the general population. Even when still controversial, it has been postulated that smoking is a form of self-medication that reduces psychiatric symptoms among individuals with these disorders. To better understand the component(s) of tobacco-inducing smoking behavior, greater attention has been directed toward nicotine. However, in recent years, new evidence has shown that cotinine, the main metabolite of nicotine, exhibits beneficial effects over psychiatric symptoms and may therefore promote smoking within this population. Some of the behavioral effects of cotinine compared to nicotine are discussed here. Cotinine, which accumulates in the body as a result of tobacco exposure, crosses the blood-brain barrier and has different pharmacological properties compared with nicotine. Cotinine has a longer plasma half-life than nicotine and showed no addictive or cardiovascular effects in humans. In addition, at the preclinical level, cotinine facilitated the extinction of fear memory and anxiety after fear conditioning, improved working memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in a monkey model of schizophrenia. Altogether, the new evidence suggests that the pharmacological and behavioral effects of cotinine may play a key role in promoting tobacco smoking in individuals that suffer from psychiatric conditions and represents a new potential therapeutic agent against psychiatric conditions such as AD and PTSD.",

Penggunaan Narkoba tidak hanya membuat si pengguna kecanduan atau ketergantungan tetapi juga dapat mengakibatkan kematian. Perkembangan Narkoba yang sangat pesat dan dapat menjangkau seluruh kalangan masyarakat tanpa memandang umur, status social, dan jabatan yang dimiliki. Dalam hal memerangi Narkoba perlu adanya kerjasama antara masyarakat dan pemerintah secara intensif. Namun pada saat ini, tidak sedikit juga wakil rakyat atau anggota Legislatif yang terjerat kasus Narkoba. Salah satu faktor anggota Legislative tergiur untuk menggunakan Narkoba dikarenakan stress berat yang di alami oleh anggota Legislative tersebut. Keterlibatan anggota Legislative dalam penyalahgunaan Narkoba mengakibatkan terbengkalainya tugas-tugas seorang wakil rakyat dan kurangnya konsentrasi dalam mengurus permasalah-permasalahan yang ada ditiap-tiap daerah. Kata Kunci: Narkoba; Anggota Legislatif. ABSTRACT Narcotics are substances or drugs that come from plants or not plants that provide a sense of happiness, calm, and relaxation for drug users. The use of narcotics not only makes the user addicted or addicted but can also lead to death. The development of narcotics is very rapid and can reach all levels of society regardless of age, social status, and position they have. In the case of combating narcotics there needs to be an intensive collaboration between the community and the government. But at this time, not a few are also representatives of the people or members of the Legislature who are entangled in drug cases. One factor Legislative members are tempted to use drugs because of the severe stress experienced by members of the Legislative. The involvement of Legislative members in drug abuse results in the neglect of the duties of a representative of the people and a lack of concentration in taking care of the problems that exist in each region.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing awareness that alcohol and drug abuse and smoking are not only harmful for the consumer but will also, when taken by a pregnant woman, adversely affect her unborn child. The consequence of the abuse will result from a combination of specific toxic effects of abusing substances and a nonspecific effect from the often very unstable environment of an alcohol- or drug-dependent mother. Poor prenatal care is a common finding in alcohol and drug abuse leading to a high incidence of complications during pregnancy and delivery including premature labor and small-for-gestational-age babies. An increased perinatal mortality has been reported following all types of abuse including tobacco use, probably as a consequence of poor prenatal care as well as of a toxic effect on the fetus. Withdrawal symptoms after birth are most prominent in opiate addiction. The already intrauterinely damaged child will if it stays with its parents often continue to be exposed to several abverse environmental factors. However, symptoms such as mental retardation following alcohol abuse and hyperactivity and emotional disturbances following drug exposure during intrauterine life have also been found in children who have been taken from the parents and placed in foster homes immediately after birth. This means that children of abusing parents both in their custody and in foster home will have to be regarded as risk children that should be subjected to careful medical and psychological follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Résumé —L'abus des drogues et l'habitude d'en dépendre constituent un problème important, répandu et croissant dans de nombreuses parties du monde. Dans certains pays les problèmes causés par l'habitude de dépendre d'une drogue donnée peuvent même être supérieurs á ce qui peut être supposé, étant donné que l'on s'aperçoit habituellement qu'une fois que les docteurs se sont rendus compte de la possibilité de l'existence d'un tel problème le diagnostic est établi bien plus fréquemment. En dehors du fait d'être responsables de la détérioration mentale et physique de l'adonnéá la drogue individuel, l'abus des drogues et l'habitude d'en dépendre ont aussi de sérieuses implications économiques et sociales en causant la préoccupation de l'sager par rapport á la drogue, la perte d'emplois qu'accompagne l'appauvrissement de la famille, l'entraînant dans des activités dépourvues d'un sens social et anti‐sociales, altérant l'habileté de sa conduite, et ainsi de suite. Les problèmes produits par l'abus des narcotiques et du cannabis sont connus depuis de nombreuses années, et quelques pays qui auparavant n‘étaient pas très touchés par de tels abus ont récemment été témoins de l'apparition de tels problèmes, en particulier chez les très jeunes. L'abus et l'habitude de dépendre de façons croissantes de différents genres de drogues chez les jeunes se sont révélés comme un facteur important sur le plan international des drogues ces dernières années, non seulement en ce qui concerne les drogues telles que l'héroïne, la cocaïne et le cannabis, mais aussi dans le cas de drogues stimulantes telles que les amphétamines. L'emploi de drogues influençant les perceptions autres que les opiates, á savoir des sédatifs, des stimulants et des calmants a augmenté de façon prononcée dans le monde entier, á tel point qu’á la dernière séance en 1965 de la Commision sur les Narcotiques, certains observateurs eurent le sentiment “qu'il pourrait arriver une époque où le problème de l'abus des soporifiques, des calmants et des stimulants pourrait éclipser celui de l'abus des narcotiques”. Il est évident qu'il se présente un grand besoin de recherche pour établir les faits, aussi bien que de l'éducation du public professionnel et du public non éclairé dans le domaine se rapportant á l'abus des drogues et á l'habitude d'en dépendre. Zusammenfassung —Der Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von Rauschgiftmitteln stellen ein bedeutsames, weitverbreitetes und anwachsendes Problem in vielen Teilen der Welt dar. In gewissen Ländern mag die Abhängigkeit von einem gegebenen Rauschgift sogar grösser als angenommen sein, da man gewöhnlich findet, dass, falls den Ärzten einmal die Möglichkeit des Bestehens eines solchen Problems zum Bewusstsein kommt, diese Diagnose viel häufiger gestellt wird. Ausser der Verantwortlichkeit für geistigen und körperlichen Verfall des dem Rauschgift ergebenen Individuums bringen der Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von Rausch‐giften auch noch schwere sozial‐ökonomische Begleiterscheinungen mit sich, indem sie Voreingenommenheit mit Rauschgift zur Hauptbeschäftigung des Verbrauchers gestalten, Berufsverlust und Verarmung der Familie verursachen und ihn in eigenbrötlerische und antisoziale Tätigkeiten verwickeln, sowie auch seine Fahrgeschicklichkeit u.s.w. beeinträchtigen. Die Probleme, die durch den Missbrauch von narkotischen Giften und Hanf hervor‐gerufen werden, sind seit vielen Jahren bekannt und viele Länder, welcher früher von diesem Missbrauch nicht sonderlich betroffen waren, beobachteten kürzlich das Auftauchen solcher Probleme, inbesonders unter sehr jungen Leuten. Der wachsende Missbrauch und die Abhängigkeit von verschiedenen Rauschgiftarten unter jungen Menschen repräsen‐tierte in den jüngsten Jahren einen bedeutsamen Faktor auf dem internationalem Rausch‐giftfeld, nicht bloss in Bezug auf Rauschgifte wie Heroin, Kokain und Hanf, sondern auch auf Reizdrogen wie Benzedrin. Die Verwendung von anderen Rauschgiften als Betäubungsmittel, welche das zentrale Nervensystem angreifen, nämlich schmerzstillende, Reiz‐ und Beruhigungsmittel, hat auf der ganzen Welt ausgesprochen zugenommen; tatsächlich so sehr, dass bei der letzten Tagung in 1965 der Kommission für Narkotische Drogen einige Beobachter der Eindruck hatten, dass “die Zeit kommenz würde, wenn das Problem des Missbrauchs von Schlafmitteln, Beruhigungsmitteln und ‘Pep’‐(Aufmunterungs‐) mitteln das des Missbrauches von narkotischen Drogen überschatten würde. Offensichtlich besteht ein grosses Bedürfnis für faktenfindende Forschung sowie auch für Schulung des professionellen und Laienpublikums auf dem Gebiete des Rauschgiftmissbrauches und der Rauschgiftabhängigkeit.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Smoking among teens and college students is a significant public health challenge. Tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol continue to be the most commonly abused drugs by teens and young adults. Educational efforts have resulted in increased awareness of the mortality and morbidity attributed to smoking, second-hand smoke, and prenatal exposure to tobacco. Short- and long-term consequences of marijuana use are well documented in the literature, but they have received less wide spread attention. Even less well known is the relationship between these substances. Does use of one lead to use of the other? Are there synergistic and/or antagonistic effects when these substances are used together? We need answers to these questions to understand the prevalence of use and the impact of these drugs on our nations youth and young adults. The gateway theory of drug use is often used to describe the progression from using alcohol or tobacco, to marijuana, and later use of other drugs like MDMA, cocaine, and heroin. While tobacco use does commonly precede marijuana use, we propose that marijuana may be a \"gateway drug\" to tobacco smoking. Our research with university students is suggesting that cigarette-smoking initiation often follows or coincides with marijuana use.",

Cannabis use has typically been associated with a \"lazy stoner\" archetype in popular culture, so it may be counterintuitive to some to learn that some athletes consistently pair the two during training. The rates of cannabis use in sport change depending on gender and type of activity. While the early research on the impact of cannabis on exercise has guided our understanding and subsequently shapes current sport policies, it is important to note these studies from the late 1960s and 1970s suffered from several methodological limitations imposed by cannabis prohibition. A change in time perception also has implications for the neuromotor control of movement, including reaction time, coordination, speed/accuracy trade-off and, ultimately, motor skill adaptation, learning, and performance.",

      "abstract": "Most people accept the widespread medical use of drugs; a large number are available over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets. Widespread advertising by the pharmaceutical industry and the working practices of the medical profession create a tendency to flight into drug support for life experiences that previously would have been accepted as mere vicissitudes. Young people observe this casual and frequent use of drugs by adults, and they are influenced by what they see. The use of drugs for relaxation, social and recreational purposes is widespread, with different cultures emphasising different substances — alcohol, nicotine and pills from medical sources in the West; alcohol and opium in the East; cocaine in the Andes and marijuana in many regions of the world. Fatigue and tiredness seem to be reduced and users feel alert, restless, anxious or even panicstricken. They are often used at discos or parties to increase excitement, ward off tiredness or to counteract the effects of sedative drugs.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse is the world’s major health concern and has reached epidemic proportions. Youth are the asset of the nation and very often they become drug-abusers and drug addict. They have various reasons such as frustration with life, peer pressure, just for fun or even a rebellion gesture towards the norms of civil society, any one is good enough to led them to the world of drugs. In recent years, the problem of drug abuse among youth has reached epidemic proportions. India has become a country of drug culture. They use drug on awaking (coffee or tea), throughout the day (cigarettes, certain soft drinks) as a way to relax (alcohol) and to reduce pain (aspirin). In our youth group become more attractive toward substance abuse and different types of drug for pleasure and entertainment. They do not know the impact of substance and drug abuse. Drug abuse can lead to drug dependence or addiction. Drug dependence arises out of a maladaptive pattern of substance use, leading to a cluster of behavioural, cognitive and psychological phenomenon that develops after repeated intake. It includes a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences. Higher priority is given to drug use than other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal state. Total 400 (200 Drug users and 200 Non-drug users) were taken from different four colleges situated in Darbhanga district of north Bihar area. The age ranges of sample were from 18 to 25 years with an average age range of 22 years. The purposive sampling technique was adhered during sample selection time.",

      "title": "Reducing the costs of alcohol in the workplace: the case for employer policies",
      "abstract": "More than 90% of the UK workforce drink alcohol and as many as 30% of male employees and 23% of female employees could be consuming quantities above ‘safe limits’. Survey results also indicate that the vast majority of dependent drinkers are in employment, Current evidence suggests that alcohol consumption, in or out of work time, can result in lower productivity, increased absenteeism and sickness absence, and increased accident rates. The annual value of industrial days lost though alcohol consumption in the UK since 1987 is estimated to be over £1.7 billion, excluding the value of lost productivity, accidents and injury. Alcohol acts as a depressant, impairing reasoning, memory, perception, balance and coordination skills even at very moderate levels of consumption. Physical and intellectual ability decline as more alcohol is consumed either at work or at leisure. In the longer run, continued consumption can lead to disease, emotional and social problems, chronic illness and even premature death. Because the majority of drinkers are in employment, these effects will have an impact in the workplace. Some adverse consequences at work are related to excessive alcohol misuse by a minority of employees, but most are associated with the moderate but inappropriate drinking behaviour of the majority. Existing evidence implies that alcohol is involved in at least one fifth of all UK industrial accidents. The probability of an accident increases six fold for the average man who has consumed two pints of beer, and risk-taking behaviour increases and decision making skills decrease even with low levels of consumption. One in ten men and one in twenty women report feelings the effects of a hangover at work and in one UK study, a quarter of all of the men interviewed reported regular lunchtime drinking. Up to 60% of USA corporations have introduced formal workplace policies of different types in order to reduce employment costs associated with alcohol consumption. However, less than 20% of UK firms have taken similar action. Workplace policies are designed to identify problem drinkers at an early stage and to provide treatment, avoiding the need for disciplinary procedures. Although many USA studies have shown workplace policies to be cost-effective, some studies report conflicting results using different definitions of successful outcome and policy goals. Many studies suffer from statistical defects and the poor definition of appropriate policy goals. The economic case for increasing the number and type of workplace policies in the UK cannot be confirmed without a consistent framework for evaluating cost-efficiency. Evidence of employment costs associated with alcohol consumption are examined in this paper and the need for further information identified. A framework for evaluating costs and benefits is outlined as a basis for future policy discussion, and the economic evaluation of alcohol workplace policies in the UK.",

While moderate intake is associated with cognitive benefits and neuroprotection, prolonged, high-dose use may lead to neuroadaptive changes, altering neuronal thresholds, dependence, and long-term brain plasticity. This review investigates the neurocognitive consequences of chronic coffee consumption and the withdrawal-related effects on brain cell thresholds, synaptic function, and higher-order cognition. The findings suggest that abrupt cessation after prolonged use can transiently impair attention, mood, and executive function due to neurochemical dysregulation.",

      "title": "Sickness absence as an alcohol‐related problem",
      "abstract": "Alcohol use is related to sickness absence in two somewhat different ways. First, chronic heavy drinking is associated with an increased risk of a large number of somatic or psychiatric illnesses, and through these illnesses continued heavy drinking may lead to sickness absence. Secondly, episodic heavy drinking and intoxication may lead to accidents, or to plain hangover, or to continuing drinking bouts which may be the grounds for sickness absence [1]. Alcoholic beverages can be used in many different ways. They can, for instance, be used as intoxicants, as beverages with meals, as thirst quenchers, as a means to celebrate several kinds of festive occasions or as a social lubricant in different situations. Different alcoholic beverages suit these different uses. Depending on the most important functions accorded to alcohol, drinking habits will vary across cultures. All alcoholic drinks, and especially wine, are used in many countries as a beverage with meals. When wine is used commonly with meals, per capita alcohol consumption is quite high. However, drinking with meals means that alcohol use is spread over many or all days of the week and the amount of alcohol consumed at one sitting usually stays reasonably low. Therefore, in wine-preferring countries such as those in the Mediterranean region, alcohol-related sickness absence should reflect mainly chronic heavy drinking. All alcoholic beverages can also be used purposively as intoxicants. In this case alcohol consumption is usually taking place in leisure time, weekends and evenings. In countries where these beverages have been used mainly as intoxicants, as in the Nordic countries, per capita alcohol consumption has traditionally been quite low. In those countries alcohol-related sickness absences are based mainly on episodic heavy drinking. During recent decades total alcohol consumption has been on the increase in the Nordic countries. In Iceland, Norway and Sweden, alcohol consumption is still lower than in the Mediterranean countries, but in Denmark and Finland total alcohol consumption (unrecorded alcohol included) is, at the moment, on the same level as in France, and higher than in Italy. This convergent trend in consumption levels is also the result of the decrease in wine consumption in the Mediterranean countries. Around the Mediterranean wine is still today used mainly as a beverage with meals, but the decrease in wine consumption has meant that other uses of alcohol have gained in relative importance, and especially among young drinkers who have begun to use alcohol to become drunk. In the Mediterranean countries a decrease in wine consumption has usually meant that wine has been substituted with water as a beverage with meals. Many people living in the Mediterranean area feel that this kind of development is a substitution of one beverage (alcohol) by another drink with meals (not including alcohol). In statistics this shows as a decrease in per capita alcohol consumption. In the Nordic countries water is also increasing its share as a beverage with meals. This, however, is not reflected in alcohol consumption statistics, as the substitution in this instance is taking place mainly from milk to water. One way to describe major trends in alcohol consumption during the last decades in western Europe could be to say that water has taken over as the traditional drink with meals. Consequently, alcoholic beverages have, during the last decades, lost their role as beverages with meals and become increasingly the beverage consumed during leisure, in many cases leading to intoxication. Consequently, compared to earlier decades alcohol-related sickness absences should nowadays be related more to heavy episodic drinking than to heavy chronic drinking. When some physical or psychiatric illness related to heavy drinking is the cause for sickness absence, in many cases it is possible to link the rates of absenteeism to alcohol consumption. Many alcohol-related somatic or psychiatric illnesses such as alcoholism, alcohol-related intoxication or alcohol-related liver diseases are already, by definition, linked to drinking in the codes of the International Classification of Diseases. When episodic heavy drinking is the cause for sickness absence it is much more difficult to relate the problem to alcohol consumption. In most cases, intoxication or any other cause leading to accident is not mentioned in the medical certificate. Even in cases where it could be mentioned, it is in the interests of the client that the accident is not combined officially with alcohol use because this could lead, for instance, to loss of insurance benefits. Furthermore, hangover or a continuing drinking bout is not a legitimate cause for being absent from work. As Thor Norström [1] has shown in his analysis of the Swedish experience, total alcohol consumption level is associated with sickness absence among men. His conclusion is that sickness absence can be added to the list of harm indicators related to alcohol consumption. Alcohol-related sickness absences and wider aspects of alcohol-related productivity losses, tie alcohol consumption regularly to economic efficiency. It may, however, be somewhat difficult to measure and document the real extent of alcohol-related sickness absenteeism in anysociety, especially as alcohol-related sickness absences are nowadays related increasingly to episodic heavy drinking rather than to prolonged heavy drinking.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological Effects of Caffeine: Is Caffeine Addictive?",
      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely used psychotropic drug in the world. Most of the caffeine consumed comes from coffee bean (i.e., a misnomer for the seed of Coffee plants), beverages (i.e., coffee, tea, soft drinks), in products containing cocoa or chocolate and in medications (i.e., analgesics, stimulants, weight-loss products, sports nutrition). The most prominent behavioral effects of caffeine take place over low to moderate doses are amplified alertness and attention. Moderate caffeine consumption leads very rarely to health risks. Higher doses of caffeine encourage negative effects such as anxiety, insomnia, restlessness and tachycardia. The habitual use of caffeine causes physical dependence that displays as caffeine withdrawal symptoms that harm normal functioning. Contrariwise, rarely high doses of caffeine can encourage psychotic and manic symptoms usually, sleep disturbances and anxiety. Even though caffeine does not engender life-threatening health difficulties frequently related to the utilization of drugs of addiction, for example amphetamine, cocaine and heroin, an incrementing number of clinical studies are exhibiting that some caffeine users become dependent on the drug and are unable to reduce consumption despite knowledge of recurrent health complications linked to constant use. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), includes caffeine addiction and withdrawal as mental disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies caffeine dependence as a clinical disorder. Furthermore, diagnosis process of caffeine dependence syndrome is accepted by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10). Therefore the intention of this study was to analyze the neuropsychological effects of caffeine and try to assess in which respect caffeine could be considered a potential drug of addiction.",

      "abstract": "While a patient may appear to be fully compliant with respect to quantity of medication ingested, the timing of doses can vary considerably. This may introduce protracted intervals between doses, particularly if dosing frequency is greater than once daily. This commonly presents in the form of drug holidays, where dosing is omitted for 1 or more days, followed by a resumption of full-strength dosing, possibly resulting in excessive drug effects when dosing suddenly resumes, rebound effects when dosing is suddenly stopped and a period without effective drug action. Poor compliance has not only been associated with poorer treatment outcome, but also with financial consequences. It has been suggested that hospitalization due to non-compliance accounts for 11.7% of all healthcare expenditure in the U.S.A. Differences between drugs, in terms of both their concentration-time profiles and their duration of action, will lead to some agents being more effective than others in the face of interruptions in dosage. A drug with an intrinsically long duration of action, such as the calcium antagonist amlodipine, will provide better therapeutic coverage than those with a shorter duration of action and therefore minimize effects generated by an intermittent pattern of dosing.",

A partial explanation can be found in an investigation of the relative meaning of the drug for the addict within his social context rather than viewing the drug simply as a pharmacological agent. The idea that addiction is a social phenomenon within the addicts family suggests a relationship between the functioning of the families of addicts and their inability to tolerate abstinence. Because the abuse of heroin or barbiturates by one family member can result in \"rewards\" for all family members, the family, in behaving as if the addict cannot control his drug use, functions in such a way as to reinforce the addiction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Eine nicht zu unterschätzende Anzahl der deutschen Jugendlichen beginnt schon früh mit dem Konsum von Drogen: Vom 18. Lebensjahr an hat bereits mehr als ein Drittel aller Jugendlichen Drogenerfahrung. Die meisten späteren Konsumenten illegaler Drogen (84 Prozent) machen erste einschlägige Erfahrungen im Alter von 14 bis 19 Jahren. Das Abhängigkeitspotenzial psychotroper Substanzen ist sehr unterschiedlich. Nicht jede Substanz, die eine psychische Abhängigkeit hervorruft, bewirkt automatisch auch eine physische Abhängigkeit. Umgekehrt allerdings besteht bei physischer Abhängigkeit meistens eine psychische Abhängigkeit. Eine physische Abhängigkeit ist im Wesentlichen durch ein körperliches Entzugssyndrom gekennzeichnet, welches dazu führt, dass ein großes Verlangen besteht, diese Substanz erneut zu konsumieren. Bei einer psychischen Abhängigkeit empfindet die Person die Notwendigkeit, in bestimmten Abständen eine entsprechende Substanz zu konsumieren, um bestimmte angenehme Wirkungen zu erzielen oder unangenehme Empfindungen zu vermeiden, die beim Nachlassen der Substanzwirkung auftreten würden.",

      "title": "Caffeine Withdrawal and Headaches",
      "abstract": "Previous research has shown that cessation of caffeine consumption may be associated with a distinct withdrawal syndrome, typified by an increase in headaches. Recent research suggests that low to moderate consumers of caffeine may report an increase in headaches if they perceive caffeine to have been withdrawn regardless of whether it has been or not. The present study provides additional support for the role of subjective perceptions in the caffeine withdrawal syndrome. Forty-three low caffeine consumers recorded the incidence of headaches when drinking caffeinated or decaffeinated beverages. When caffeine was withdrawn the incidence of headaches increased but this effect was only significant in those individuals who could discriminate whether they were consuming caffeinated or decaffeinated beverages. This result suggests a major role of subjective perceptions and expectancies in the caffeine withdrawal syndrome, a view that contrasts with the notion that a significant proportion of caffeine consumers are physically dependent upon caffeine.",

      "abstract": "Objective: A case report of carrot addiction is presented with a review of the literature and comment on the role of beta carotene in addictive behaviour. Clinical Picture: The addiction occurred in a 49-year-old woman under conditions of stress due to marital problems, leading to a depressive illness and increased smoking. The patient maintained that the sensations of carrot craving and withdrawal were quite distinct from those associated with smoking. Treatment: The patient was advised to record her daily carrot consumption. Outcome: The patient did not return for several months, but stopped eating carrots after an operation, at which time she also stopped smoking. Conclusion: Compusive carrot eating, regarded as a rare condition, has received scant documentation, unlike hypercarotenemia due to unusual diets or food fads. Nervousness, craving, insomnia, waterbrash and irritability are associated with withdrawal from excessive carrot eating. The basis for the addiction is believed to be beta carotene, found in carrots. Does carrot eating, an aggressively oral activity, merely act as a behavioural substitute for smoking? Or does beta carotene contain a chemical element that replicates the addictive component of nicotine? Further study of this unusual but intriguing addiction may reveal more about the basis of all addictions, with particular implications for the cessation of cigarette smoking.",

El presente trabajo evalua la influencia que a largo plazo presentan ciertas variables ambientales, individuales y biologicas durante la adolescencia, sobre la vulnerabilidad a los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina y su nivel de consumo en sujetos adultos. Concretamente, hemos comprobado como la exposicion durante la adolescencia al alcohol o cocaina en forma de binge, el nivel del rasgo de personalidad de busqueda de la novedad, o la pertenencia al genero masculino o femenino, influyen en la Autoadministracion de cocaina y en la adquisicion del Condicionamiento de Preferencia de Lugar (CPL) inducido por la cocaina u otras drogas en los ratones evaluados durante la etapa adulta. Ademas, dado que hoy por hoy no existe una terapia farmacologica eficaz para el tratamiento de la dependencia a la cocaina, el presente trabajo comprueba la capacidad del topiramato, un farmaco anticonvulsivante, para bloquear los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina. Asi, hemos evaluado ratones adultos expuestos a diferentes patrones de administracion de topiramato en la adquisicion, expresion, extincion y reinstauracion del CPL inducido con diferentes dosis de cocaina. Los principales resultados obtenidos indican que la exposicion a un consumo intensivo de drogas durante la adolescencia, el alto nivel de busqueda de la novedad y la pertenencia al sexo femenino, aumentan a largo plazo la sensibilidad a los efectos reforzantes de la cocaina, asi como su consumo, en la etapa adulta. Nuestros resultados indican que el topiramato potencia el efecto reforzante y la conducta de busqueda de la cocaina, por lo que no parece recomendable su uso en el tratamiento de la adiccion a la cocaina.

      "abstract": "A case is presented in which the abuse of anabolic steroids by a body builder led to an unusual physical sign. The case discusses the effects that anabolic steroid abuse can have upon manhood. The frequency of anabolic steroid misuse is increasing. The implications of this with respect to psychiatric illness and violent crime are discussed. It is well known that the use of anabolic steroids among young men, body builders in particular, is growing apace (Perry and Littlepage, 1992), and they may be aware of the risks of impurity and contamination. There is a wide range of anabolic steroids in use; they are often used in doses of greater than 1 mg/kg per day. As well as single use, the misuser may 'stack' (use more than one at a time) or 'pyramid' (use increasing doses of a given drug) the steroids (Kennedy, 1990). The physical and psychiatric effects of anabolic steroids are well known (Kashkin and Kleber, 1989; Brower, 1992; Pope and Katz, 1988). However, we describe a case with psychiatric symptoms, a violent outburst and a unique (?) physical sign.",

Embora possua propriedades medicinais, a maconha é utilizada principalmente para fins recreativos, devido suas propriedades relaxantes. No entanto, seu uso contínuo e crônico é capaz de desenvolver sérios problemas à saúde. A pesquisa teve como objetivo reunir informações, na modalidade revisão de literatura, sobre as consequência e malefícios do uso de maconha. Sendo verificado que diversos estudos demonstram com base em evidências que o uso da maconha, principalmente em longo prazo, acarreta problemas relacionados a psicoses como a esquizofrenia, além de causar danos cognitivos e outros problemas de saúde.

      "abstract": "Tobacco use is a single leading preventable cause of death worldwide. It contains nicotine, which is one of the most addictive psychoactive drugs; thus, successful quitting becomes a challenging process. Occupation has a profound influence on tobacco use patterns, and in the majority of scenarios, users are unable to achieve abstinence to maintain the need for the psychoactive effect of nicotine to cope up with job stresses and to remain energetic. Various tobacco cessation aids are available with variable success rates. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or vaping has become popular, particularly in Western Countries and among occupational workers as they contain less harmful chemicals than combustible cigarettes and can help heavy smokers to quit the habit. Reports of short- and long-term health effects of vaping have currently led to a ban on the production, manufacturing, and advertising of e-cigarettes. Pharmacological interventions such as bupropion and varenicline have been proven to provide long-term abstinence; however, neuropsychiatric side effects limit their use. This paper focusses on the hypothesis that whether the electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) or vaping and pharmacological interventions are an effective tobacco cessation interventions.",

Also common is the combined use of alcohol and marijuana, producing additive effects. Although users generally express the belief that marijuana impairs their driving ability, many nevertheless drive after drug use. In addition to impaired perception and psychomotor performance, attentional failure accounts for much of the marijuana-induced driving impairment. Performance decrements may persist for some hours after recovery from the subjective effects of marijuana. The impact of marijuana use on driving ability is dose-related. Enforcement authorities are considering a scale of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the drug's active ingredient) in the blood or breath that may correlate with blood alcohol levels as indicators of driving under the influence, although the metabolism of THC is more complex than that of alcohol.",

      "title": "Inhalant Abuse as an Adolescent Drug Problem: An",
      "abstract": "The inhalation of the vapors of chemical substances for the purpose of achieving an intoxicated state is currently quite popular within the adolescent popula- tion. However, this form of substance abuse often receives less attention than more well-known drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol. This paper is intended to be an introduction to the topic of inhalant abuse, including prevalence rates, the types of substances typically abused, their effects on the body, methods of inhalation, symptoms associated with this practice, the risks involved, and finally, the question of physical and psychological addiction. When the topic of substance abuse among adolescents is discussed, drugs such as marijuana, LSD, crack, and amphetamines tend to be- come focal points. One group of substances that is often overlooked or given only marginal attention is generally known as inhalants, a large number of products whose vapors can be inhaled in order to achieve an intoxicated state. The fact that these substances are abused to an equal (or even greater) extent than those drugs men- tioned above (Johnson, O'Malley, & Bachman, 1987; Oetting & Beau- vais, 1990), and yet are generally ignored by the public at large, may suggest that people are unaware of the existence of inhalant abuse, that they are unaware of the wide prevalence of this practice, and/or that they are simply unaware of the hazards involved in the abuse of inhalants.",

This study reviews the cultivation of cannabis, its medicinal significance, and its social impacts. It is believed that cannabis has many medicinal properties that could prove very useful for the managing different disease, and at the same time it has many harmful effects that expose it to many legal and social aspects. Cannabis contains a psychoactive compound called tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) that creates a psychogenic effect. It can be consumed through the respiratory tract and digestive tract through smoking and oral ingesting, respectively. In contrast, cannabidiol (CBD), another component derived from cannabis, is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that has gained popularity for its medicinal values and as a supplement.",

      "title": "Niveles de ansiedad y depresión en los fumadores que acuden a una consulta de deshabituación tabáquica y factores relacionados",
      "abstract": "Se sabe que los fumadores tienen mas riesgo de desarrollar un trastorno mental que aquellos que no fuman, presentando segun algunas series niveles mas elevados de ansiedad y depresion de forma basal. Incluso el propio intento de abandono o la reduccion del numero de cigarrillos podria determinar un mayor riesgo de aparicion de un episodio depresivo mayor. Sin embargo, lo que sucede tras un periodo mas o menos largo de abstinencia con la sintomatologia ansiosodepresiva no esta del todo esclarecido. Ademas, existe una clara asociacion entre tabaquismo y enfermedad mental, con una prevalencia de tabaquismo que alcanza mas del doble que la poblacion general. Esta circunstancia se relaciona con un mayor riesgo de recaidas, peores tasas de abandono y sintomatologia de abstinencia mas severa, suponiendo un importante reto en una consulta de deshabituacion tabaquica. Por otro lado, se dispone de evidencia suficiente acerca de la utilidad de los farmacos de primera linea para el abandono del tabaco (terapia sustitutiva con nicotina (TSN), Bupropion y Varenicline) en pacientes sanos, aunque la evidencia en psiquiatricos es mas limitada ya que se excluyeron de los estudios de comercializacion. Sin embargo, existen ciertas cautelas en su empleo en relacion a la posibilidad de un mayor riesgo de efectos neuropsiquiatricos graves en pacientes con y sin antecedentes psiquiatricos, circunstancia que no esta del todo aclarada en la literatura y que ha conllevado la inclusion de una alerta negra en las cajas de los dos medicamentos por la US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Aunque no existe contraindicacion para el empleo de estos farmacos en pacientes psiquiatricos, la monitorizacion estrecha deberia ser la norma. En base a lo anterior, se pretendio valorar la influencia de un programa de abandono del tabaco llevado a cabo en una unidad secundaria hospitalaria de deshabituacion tabaquica en el estado emocional de los pacientes mediante la medicion de los niveles de ansiedad/depresion a lo largo del mismo y las posibles diferencias en funcion de la presencia de antecedentes psiquiatricos. Para ello, se llevo a cabo un estudio de cohortes observacional, longitudinal y prospectivo, de la practica clinica habitual, con inclusion consecutiva de pacientes que acudieron a la Unidad de Deshabituacion Tabaquica del Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena para dejar de fumar entre marzo 2011 y octubre de 2012. Se incluyeron a todos los fumadores mayores de edad con un consumo acumulado > 10 paquetes/ano que aceptaron participar en el programa de abandono. Se excluyeron mujeres embarazadas o en periodo de lactancia, personas tratadas exclusivamente con parches de nicotina, que no comprendieran las indicaciones del cuestionario de ansiedad/depresion que se utilizo o que rechazaran participar en el estudio. Se llevo a cabo un programa de tratamiento farmacologico y de tipo cognitivo-conductual de 5 visitas (basal, a los 15 dias, primer, segundo y tercer mes). La pauta de tratamiento fue de 150 o 300 mg para Bupropion y de 1 mg/12 horas para Varenicline (previa titulacion) con una duracion de 8 semanas en los dos casos. El tratamiento se indico en todos los casos por el mismo neumologo que decidio la medicacion en funcion de las caracteristicas de cada paciente (antecedentes psiquiatricos, toma de medicacion concomitante, intentos previos, preferencias del paciente y costo). Se valoraron los sintomas de ansiedad y depresion mediante el empleo de la escala hospitalaria de ansiedad y depresion (HADS). Esta medicion se llevo a cabo tanto en la visita basal como 1er y 3er mes del seguimiento. De la misma manera se comprobo abstinencia mediante cooximetria y entrevista clinica. Todos los casos en los que no se pudo constatar la abstinencia (imposibilidad de contactar y o medir CO) fueron considerados como recaidas. Finalmente se incluyo un poblacion de 678 fumadores.\n Ver mas",

Although much drug use is a social activity, apart from those under international control, many other substances are consumed, including alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and khat. Alcohol and tobacco lead to more harm to individuals and society than all of the controlled drugs combined. The sale and use of alcohol may be restricted to certain users (e.g., adults) in certain places (e.g., licensed premises) and while undergoing certain activities (e.g., driving) but there is a widespread assumption that it is not a drug. The damage caused by tobacco smoking is a long-term effect that is not immediately apparent to users. Although nicotine, the psychoactive principal in tobacco, has long been regarded as a poison, it is available in skin patches and smoking devices with little current restriction. Caffeine rarely causes serious problems to consumers. Khat is a controlled drug in the United Kingdom and a few other countries but is not under international control.",

Apart from causing health hazards to the users concerned, the associated physiological and psychological effects manifested when taking the drug(s) often induce abnormal behaviour, posing a threat to other people, damaging the abuser’s financial situation, and jeopardising his or her social status. The government’s efforts to steer the public, especially young people, away from abusing drugs have unfortunately been undermined by misleading information about the commonly abused drugs: a notable example being ‘taking Ecstasy can help you keep slim’! Those unfounded myths are due to misunderstanding or lack of knowledge on the part of the drug users. In this paper, facts about certain commonly abused drugs and substances are discussed and myths that may have prompted curious individuals to experiment with them are also introduced.",

Memory, concentration and performance are, on the contrary, weakened at that time.

      "title": "Enhancement drugs: are there limits to what we should enhance and why?",
      "abstract": "Substances, such as alcohol, opiates and cannabis, have been used by humans for millennia. Today, a much wider range of substances are used for a range of purposes, including the enhancement of performance during university studies, sexual experiences, sports, exercise, at celebrations, socializing and the experience of art and music. Substance use is also associated with a range of harmful effects to the individual and society as a whole. Prohibitions, regulation, prevention and treatment have all been used to protect against this harm. In this commentary, it is argued that public health interventions should target relevant harms and not to evaluate which aspects of human endeavors and experiences should be enhanced and which should not. It is argued that interventions should directly target the harmful effects, using the best available evidence. Two examples are given of substances that may be altered to prevent serious harm - one for alcohol and one for cannabis. In the case of alcohol, the addition of dissolved oxygen could reduce both the risk of accidents and the risk of liver damage associated with alcohol consumption. In the case of cannabis, there is strong indication that the reduction of content Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol and the increase of cannabidiol could reduce the risk of psychoses and the addiction associated with its use. The aim of this article is to show that responsible regulation should not necessarily be restricted to preventing the use and/or (in the case of alcohol) a reduction in the amounts and frequency of its use, but should also aim to include a range of other strategies that could reduce the burden of illness associated with illicit substance use.",

En el momento actual se encuentra independizado realizando estudios superiores. Su único soporte social es su pareja. Ingresa por amenazas autolíticas ante la imposibilidad de consumir tóxicos. Intervención El paciente presenta, desde el inicio de su seguimiento, una evolución tórpida derivada principalmente del consumo y de las conductas de búsqueda de sustancias psicoactivas. A los 15 años inicia el uso de tóxicos con cannabis y dextrometorfano, a los 17 años ya consumía semanalmente heroína y cocaína fumadas, dicho consumo se ha mantenido hasta la actualidad. Presenta múltiples ingresos por intentos autolíticos. Ha tenido conflictos legales llegando incluso a cumplir condenas de privación de libertad. El patrón de consumo es rígido, asociado a un interés restringido por el uso de sustancias y la experimentación de estados alterados de conciencia. Al explorar sus intereses el paciente cita las sustancias psicoactivas, la lingüística y la política china. Resultados y conclusiones: Las características clínicas más llamativas del Trastorno de Espectro Autista son la dificultad en la interacción social así como los intereses restringidos y las conductas repetitivas y esterotipadas. Suscita dudas sobre qué papel tiene el consumo de tóxicos en este caso, como síntoma (intereses restringidos que condicionan la actividad diaria), también se puede entender como una comorbilidad que ensombrece el pronóstico y evolución.

A recent German study employed the Marijuana Motives Measure to survey young adults, analyzing four motivational factors in the context of casual leisure. The research aimed to understand the reasons behind adults’ daily cannabis use, its link to consumption frequency, and situations. The findings highlight cannabis use for hedonic pleasure, relaxation, and enhancing social experiences. Individuals driven by self-focused motives, seeking relaxation and hedonic pleasure, tend to use it more frequently, while other-focused motives, such as sociable conversation, are associated with less frequent and occasional consumption. The study further revealed that people who consume cannabis for self-focused motives typically do so alone or with someone at home, whereas those who use it for other-focused motives, such as sociable conversation, tend to do so in social settings.",

      "title": "THE GENETICS OF CANNABIS INVOLVEMENT IN HUMANS: A GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE",
      "abstract": "The review of the genetic-epidemiological aspects of cannabis use by Agrawal & Lynskey [1] is very timely, as it is published at the time of a highly charged debate on whether or not cannabis is an addictive, harmful drug, and whether its use should be more or less proscribed. In the United Kingdom, cannabis was recently downgraded from a class B (amphetamines, barbiturates) to a class C drug (benzodiazepine tranquillizers, milder stimulants), largely because of evidence of it being less harmful compared to other class B drugs, and public opinion, in which 60% of the UK population (presumably including most of the 4 million or so users of cannabis in the United Kingdom), believe the drug should be decriminalized. On the other side of this debate is the view that cannabis is addictive, causes mental illness in some users [2] and is a gateway to harder drugs [3]. Psychiatry has led many of the arguments on the harmful effects of cannabis, especially in relation to the development of schizophrenia. In fact, this debate goes back to the 1970s, with the observations of Paton on cannabis use and schizophreniform symptoms [4]. Genetic epidemiology is a powerful tool which can at least provide evidence for or against these assertions: are there genetic factors involved in cannabis dependence? Is mental illness caused by cannabis, does it make cannabis use more likely, or does it share genetic risk factors which cause comorbidity? Is cannabis a gateway to other drugs or does it share genetic and environmental factors which give rise to correlation? Answers to all these questions are necessary for an informed debate on how to deal with cannabis use in society, especially as usage is so prevalent. The authors summarize the current body of data from twin family and adoption studies: these are all consistent with cannabis use, abuse and dependence having heritable components. Moreover, twin studies can begin to disentangle the genetic architecture of each of these stages, allowing speculation on what type of genes and environmental might be involved. For initial cannabis use, this may include genes that influence sensation-seeking or problem behaviour, and social factors related to peer group behaviour, socio-economic status and drug availability, and for abuse/dependence may include genes that regulate drug sensitivity and reactions to cannabis. Positive subjective reactions (e.g. getting high, feeling happy, silly things) are associated strongly with subsequent cannabis dependence and, conversely, adverse effects might tend to be protective. Similar findings are seen in alcohol dependence where euphoria and tolerance are risk factors and adverse experiences such as flushing from aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency are protective. It seems clear that about one-third of the population of cannabis users experience psychological adverse effects (confusion, memory loss, paranoia, etc.) and that in some individuals these adverse effects are akin to the symptoms of schizophrenia. One might therefore assume that these aversive reactions would protect against dependence. One of the most common arguments against cannabis use is that its use, especially early use, is associated strongly with the use of more harmful drugs such as cocaine and heroin, just as alcohol and tobacco use appear to act as a gateway to cannabis use. These effects may include correlated risks, i.e. genetic and environmental risk factors that influence the liability to use of any drug, such as social availability of the drug, or genes which predispose to any drug use, versus a causal ('gateway') influence on subsequent hard drug use, such as pharmacological effects of cannabis which increase liability to hard drug use. Certainly there is biological evidence of shared activation of mesolimbic dopamine transmission by both cannabis and opiates [5] which could represent pharmacological priming. The authors address the correlated risk model versus the gateway risk model; the evidence from multiple twin studies tends to favour the correlated model, i.e. genetic and environmental risk factors that influence the liability to use of any drug, but the 'gateway' model cannot be excluded. A Dutch twin study published while the present paper was in press addresses this question specifically [6]. Originally the legalization of cannabis in the Netherlands was prompted by the desire to break the link between cannabis and hard drugs, as 'coffee-shops' should prevent young people coming into contact with hard drug users. Their study found that early cannabis users had strongly elevated odds of subsequent illicit drug use relative to their non-early-using co-twins, suggesting a role not for shared genetic or environmental familial risk factors, but individual-specific experiences in progression from cannabis use. The authors also touch upon the topical area of the involvement of cannabis in other psychiatric disorders. Most of the current debate relates to schizophrenia, but most data on psychiatric illness condern the relationship between cannabis involvement and other psychiatric disorders, especially major depression and conduct disorder. In both these cases comorbidity seems more a result of overlapping genetic influence than causative factors. Is the same true for schizophrenia, or is there an overlap between susceptibility genes?

La que genera el tabaquismo no es sencilla, comprende multiples factores, que provocan en el individuo una severa afectacion que conlleva su perpetuacion en el consumo. Asi el tabaco provoca fundamentalmente dos tipos de dependencia: fisica o farmacologica y psicologica o psicocomportamental. No obstante, a las mismas se debe anadir el `habito o automatismo'; adquirido tras anos de consumo diario de mas de 20 cigarrillos de promedio. Por otro lado, el fumador inveterado asocia el consumo de tabaco con gran cantidad de estimulos, es el componente manual-oral del cigarrillo, al que ademas hay que sumar la dependencia social que genera el pitillo al constituir en muchas ocasiones el intermediario para comenzar una entrevista o mantener un conversacion. Por todo ello, el tratamiento del tabaquismo es un tema complejo que requiere ser abordado de una forma multifactorial. Considerandolo no unicamente como una adiccion fisica que requiere un tratamiento farmacologico, sino que ademas debe contemplar la realizacion de un tratamiento psicologico, ya sea individual o de grupo, que ayude al paciente a pasar de ser fumador a exfumador, aprendiendo a vivir sin tabaco. En este articulo hacemos una revision de las distintas terapias psicologicas utilizadas en la deshabituacion tabaquica.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs has become a concern in high-performance athletes. Professional athletes are more exposed to drugs than the general population. Although some drugs are unquestionably detrimental to performance, several studies have nevertheless shown evidence of increased consumption of these substances within this sub-population. This review aimed to elucidate alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, cannabis, and opioid use among high-performance athletes, discussing the prevalence of substance use, its impacts, and alternatives to treatment in this special population. Unfortunately, no clinical trials for the treatment of substance use disorders were carried out with this specific sub-population. Therefore, the strategies adopted for the general population should be adapted to high-performance athletes. Psychological, psychosocial, psychoeducational, cognitive-behavioural, motivational interviewing approaches can be implemented. As regards pharmacological treatment, medications used in the treatment of alcohol and tobacco dependence, such as naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate, varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine replacement treatment can be used without problems. However, some medications used in cocaine and opioid dependence treatment, such as moldafinil and methadone, are prohibited by doping enforcement agencies. Professionals involved with athletes should be aware of the signs and symptoms of the acute effects of substances so as to enable an early identification of substance abuse problems, especially during training periods.",

      "title": "Cocaethylene: When Cocaine and Alcohol Are Taken Together",
      "abstract": "Cocaine is taken frequently together with ethanol and this combination produces a psychoactive metabolite called cocaethylene which has similar properties to the parent drug and may be more cardiotoxic. Cocaethylene has a longer half-life than cocaine, so that people who combine cocaine and ethanol may experience a longer-lasting, as well as more intense, psychoactive effect. Cocaethylene is the only known instance where a new psychoactive substance is formed entirely within the body. Although known to science for decades, cocaethylene has not been extensively studied and even its metabolic pathways are not entirely elucidated. Like its parent drug, cocaethylene blocks the reuptake of dopamine and increases post-synaptic neuronal activity; the parent drug may also block reuptake of serotonin as well. Cocaethylene has been studied in animal models in terms of its pharmacology and its potential neurological effects. Since the combination of cocaine and alcohol is commonly used, it is important for clinicians to be aware of cocaethylene, its role in prolonging or intensifying cocaine intoxication, and how it may exacerbate cocaine-induced cardiovascular disorders. Most cardiac-related risk assessment tools do not ask about cocaine use, which can prevent clinicians from making optimal therapeutic choices. Greater awareness of cocaethylene is needed for clinicians, and those who use cocaine should also be aware of the potential for polysubstance use of cocaine and ethanol to produce a potentially potent and long-lasting psychoactive metabolite.",

      "title": "The Effect of Cannabis Compared with Alcohol on Driving",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of both alcohol and cannabis use and the high morbidity associated with motor vehicle crashes has lead to a plethora of research on the link between the two. Drunk drivers are involved in 25% of motor vehicle fatalities, and many accidents involve drivers who test positive for cannabis. Cannabis and alcohol acutely impair several driving‐related skills in a dose‐related fashion, but the effects of cannabis vary more between individuals than they do with alcohol because of tolerance, differences in smoking technique, and different absorptions of Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. Detrimental effects of cannabis use vary in a dose‐related fashion, and are more pronounced with highly automatic driving functions than with more complex tasks that require conscious control, whereas alcohol produces an opposite pattern of impairment. Because of both this and an increased awareness that they are impaired, marijuana smokers tend to compensate effectively while driving by utilizing a variety of behavioral strategies. Combining marijuana with alcohol eliminates the ability to use such strategies effectively, however, and results in impairment even at doses which would be insignificant were they of either drug alone. Epidemiological studies have been inconclusive regarding whether cannabis use causes an increased risk of accidents; in contrast, unanimity exists that alcohol use increases crash risk. Furthermore, the risk from driving under the influence of both alcohol and cannabis is greater than the risk of driving under the influence of either alone. Future research should focus on resolving contradictions posed by previous studies, and patients who smoke cannabis should be counseled to wait several hours before driving, and avoid combining the two drugs.",

If you want to get drunk, usually use dextromethorphan (DMP) pills, but now switch to mixing herbal cough medicines with energy drinks. Herbal cough medicine is usually used as a cough reliever, but in teens today, herbal cough medicine is starting to be abused. Mixing energy drinks using herbal cough medicine are motivated by a lack of positive activities or activities, influenced by peers or the environment where the subject lives, lack of application of religious and school education, lack of the role of parents in supervising their children, easy access to herbal cough medicines and drinks energy in large quantities, and the price is cheap. The crime that occurred is not only limited to theft but also drugs and drinking. The only difference, they are not drunk with liquor, but mixed energy drinks with some herbal cough medicine sachets. CASE REPORT: We found a case of acute psychotic disorders due to cannabis use and other psychoactive substances, namely, a mixture of herbal cough medicine containing DMP and energy drinks containing caffeine, after 2 days of use, in a 20-year-old male, found a delusion and hallucinations. CONCLUSIONS: Every use of addictive substances and psychotropic substances will have an impact on life and health. The use of addictive and psychotropic substances when consumed in excess of the dose will damage some organ functions, affect the smooth operation of organ systems, and can also cause acute psychosis.",

This study aims to determine whether adolescents high in trait social anxiety report more cigarette use and greater urge to smoke before, during, and after friend interactions than do teens low in trait social anxiety. Four hundred two students who reported smoking more than once during high school were assessed approximately every 30 min during up to 84-day monitoring sessions. Controlling for momentary anxiety, high socially anxious teens were equally or less likely to smoke, but more likely to report urge to smoke, surrounding friend interactions than low socially anxious teens. Although high socially anxious adolescents do not smoke more than low socially anxious peers, they may believe that they should need a cigarette in anxiety-provoking situations. Such urges may later develop into smoking behaviors.",

A number of studies examining the effects of ethanol pretreatment or availability on tobacco consumption have demonstrated that ethanol potentiates tobacco consumption. Whether smoking potentiates alcohol consumption is not known. Possible mechanisms underlying the alcohol/tobacco association, including cross-tolerance between the two drugs, are discussed. Tobacco appears to counteract the deleterious effects of alcohol on some measures of performance. The association between alcohol and tobacco consumption may have some relevance regarding the issue of relapse to either one of the drugs.

      "abstract": "In general, 'drinkers smoke', and a high proportion of the alcohol-dependent population is also nicotine-dependent. Statistically, the majority of alcoholics will die of smoking-related, rather than alcohol-related, disease. This co-dependent sub-population may have higher levels of nicotine dependence, and find smoking cessation more difficult. Major reasons are that concurrent alcohol use, and/or prior alcohol exposure, may change the reinforcing effects of nicotine, and that each drug becomes a pharmacological cue for the expectation of the other. If so, then smokers whose nicotine dependence is impacted by alcohol, represent a large and distinct sub-population in which both the therapeutic and molecular targets for smoking cessation are altered. This, in turn, has implications for the validity of animal models of nicotine reinforcement, and for the development of novel smoking cessation medications. It is no longer possible to ignore the fact that the two most prevalent and damaging addictive drugs in our society are very commonly used by the same individuals. Without a better understanding of the psychological and pharmacological interactions between alcohol and nicotine that impact dependence, we cannot hope to provide appropriate medications for this large and problematic patient group. Our intention in this opinion overview is to use the current literature to provide a framework for future studies into the impact of alcohol use on the reinforcing effects of nicotine.",

With changing migrationpatterns, epidemiological and clinical outcomes may have changed. The aim of this article is to review current knowledge on pharmacological, epidemiological and clinical aspects of khat use. Khat use is still highly prevalent in the countries mentioned, and in African and Yemeniemigrant groups. Preclinical and clinical data confirm its addictivepotential as well as possible psychological, psychiatric and medical consequences related to stimulant use; however, existing epidemiological studies do not focus on the prevalence of problematic use or dependence. There are no indications of high prevalence of khat use in other cultural and ethnic groups. Data are lacking on possible increased psychotogenic risks when khat is used outside of the original cultural context. As with alcohol use in many countries, khat use can be considered as a lifestyle in some specific countries, covering the spectrum from nonproblematic use to problematic use and dependence. Khat dependence is associated with high morbidity and societal and economical costs.",

      "title": "Development of Dependence in Smokers and Rodents With Voluntary Nicotine Intake: Similarities and Differences",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Smoking and vaping throughout adolescence and early adulthood lead to nicotine dependence. Nicotine withdrawal is associated with somatic and affective withdrawal symptoms that contribute to smoking and relapse. Affective nicotine withdrawal symptoms in humans include craving for cigarettes, depression, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and cognitive deficits. Methods Herein, we review clinical studies that investigated nicotine dependence in people who smoke or vape. We also discuss studies that investigated the development of dependence in animals with oral nicotine intake, nicotine aerosol self-administration, and intravenous nicotine self-administration. Results Clinical studies report that adolescents who smoke daily develop nicotine dependence before those who smoke infrequently, but ultimately all smokers become dependent in adulthood. Preclinical studies indicate that rats that self-administer nicotine also become dependent. Rats that self-administer nicotine display somatic withdrawal signs and affective withdrawal signs, including increased anxiety and depressive-like behavior, cognitive deficits, and allodynia. Most nicotine withdrawal signs were observed in rodents with daily (7 days/week) or intermittent long access (23-hour) to nicotine. Clinical smoking studies report symptoms of nicotine dependence in adolescents of both sexes, but virtually all preclinical nicotine self-administration studies have been done with adult male rats. Conclusions The role of sex and age in the development of dependence in nicotine self-administration studies remains under-investigated. However, the role of sex and age in nicotine withdrawal has been thoroughly evaluated in studies in which nicotine was administered noncontingently. We discuss the need for volitional nicotine self-administration studies that explore the gradual development of dependence during adolescence and adulthood in rodents of both sexes. Implications The reviewed clinical studies investigated the development of nicotine dependence in male and female adolescent and young adult smokers and vapers. These studies indicate that most adolescent smokers and vapers gradually become nicotine dependent. Preclinical studies with rodents show that nicotine intake in widely used self-administration models also leads to dependence. However, almost all animal studies that investigated the development of nicotine dependence have been conducted with adult male rats. To better model smoking and vaping, it is important that nicotine intake in rats or mice starts during adolescence and that both sexes are included.",

      "title": "A relação entre o uso da cannabis e o despertar de psicoses",
      "abstract": "Na última década, houve um aumento no aparecimento de transtornos psicóticos e o número de internações pelo uso de Cannabis, popularmente conhecida como maconha. Droga ilícita mais utilizada no mundo, a maconha já foi utilizada por cerca de 9 em cada 100 brasileiros. Seu consumo ocorre na maioria das vezes através do fumo, mas também pode ser através de alimentos, chás e cápsulas. Correlacionar o uso da Cannabis com o desenvolvimento de psicoses, considerando sua aplicação terapêutica e recreativa. Para a elaboração desta revisão bibliográfica foi realizado um levantamento eletrônico de artigos nacionais e internacionais(inglês e espanhol), em sua maioria publicados nos últimos 10 anos, utilizando bancos de dados como Scielo, Lilacs e PubMed, além da utilização um manual, uma cartilha, livros e vídeos especializados. Existem evidências sugerindo que a exposição dos componentes presentes na Cannabis em idades mais jovens, principalmente na adolescência, somado aos fatores familiares e genéticos estão diretamente associados ao desenvolvimento de psicoses. Além disso, a produção de linhagens da planta com alta concentração de delta-9-tetrahidrocanabinol (THC) pode apresentar um grande risco para a saúde mental geral, uma vez que elas são mais potentes, gerando efeitos em maiores proporções. Há uma correlação entre o consumo de Cannabis e o desenvolvimento de psicoses, sendo o uso de Cannabis, associado a outros fatores de risco, uma variável importante para o surgimento de psicoses.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic disease with several commonalities with smoking. A review of the factors that influence compliance with smoking cessation methods may therefore suggest considerations relevant for the treatment of asthma. Many factors influence whether a smoker will decide to seek help and thus become a patient. However, once this hurdle is overcome a different set of factors influence compliance and whether the treatment is successful. Most successful quitters use individual methods rather than organized smoking cessation programmes. The most important predictive factors for whether a smoker will be successful in quitting smoking are socioeconomic rather than disease specific and this is the case whether health support services are available or not. Smokers who use nicotine replacement products are approximately twice as likely to be successful in quitting than nonusers. While the rate of nicotine absorption from these products is important, it is not the primary predictor of successful quitting. Other important factors include: self-control of nicotine dose, the skills required to use the product, and the side-effects. However, the relative importance of these factors is not well understood. An individual's perception of the appropriateness of a particular treatment and which treatment they think that they will prefer are also important in successful smoking cessation.",

      "abstract": "Cannabisabhängige Jungendliche erklären ihren Konsum oft damit, dass sie mit dem Konsum beabsichtigen, Stressoren zu kompensieren. Sie möchten Abschalten, ausspannen oder nicht an ihre Probleme denken. Auf diesem Hintergrund kann Cannabiskonsum als Copingstrategie angesehen werden. Coping bezeichnet alle Strategien, die zu einer Reduzierung von Stress eingesetzt werden, auch wenn sie nicht unbedingt dieses Ziel erfüllen. In einer Querschnittstudie wurde an 70 cannabisabhängigen Jugendlichen und 90 unauffälligen Jugendlichen untersucht, in wieweit sich deren Copingverhalten voneinander unterscheidet und ob beide Gruppen ähnlich erfolgreich in der Bewältigung ihrer Stressoren sind. Beiden Gruppen wurde ein etabliertes Fragebogenpaket vorgelegt, das sich in verschiedenen Untersuchungen als reliabel und valide erwiesen hat. Damit wurde die psychische Belastung, funktionale und dysfunktionale Copingstile in verschiedenen Alltagsbereichen, Alltagsstressoren in denselben Bereichen sowie kritische Lebensereignisse erfasst. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass cannabisabhängige Jugendliche mehr kritische Lebensereignisse berichteten, mehr externalisierende Verhaltensauffälligkeiten zeigten und auch dysfunktionalere Copingstrategien einsetzten. In Regressionsanalysen konnte gezeigt werden, dass es den Cannabisabhängigen nicht gelingt, mit ihren Copingstrategien den pathogenen Effekt von Alltagsstressoren auf die psychische Gesundheit abzupuffern. Möglichkeiten für die Behandlung von Cannabisabhängigkeit werden diskutiert und die Wichtigkeit von gezielten Programmen zum effektiven Problemlösen herausgestellt.",

Los modelos de consumo difieren de forma significativa; los consumidores de cocaina siguen un modelo con mas episodios de consumo de droga, gastan mas dinero en la compra de cocaina y consumen alcohol en mayor grado. Por otro lado, el modelo de consumidores de metanfetamina incluye una proporcion mayor de mujeres, normalmente consumen la droga a diario, consumen marihuana con mas frecuencia y experimentan consecuencias medicas y psiquiatricas mas severas.

In certain types of users, this dosage may remain constant in small quantities for years. Another and far more numerous group is composed of those who increase the amount used until eventually they are forced to undergo treatment or begin reduction of the dose themselves.

While the prevalence of alcohol use disorder still remains around 10% in the subjects over 65 year old age, and daily encountered by hospital or nursing-home caregivers. Alcohol misuse is often overlooked in elderly people, which then obtain lesser care than younger adults although the care prognosis remains as good as or better than before the age of 65, alcoholic abstinence gets always a place among care offers to elders suffering of alcohol use disorders and dependence. However abstinence is a complex notion gathering various representations or meanings, and induces necessary psychological changes. Alcoholic abstinence seems thus to be feared by families or caregivers, because of lack of knowledge about the addictive dimension of the disorder. On behalf of ultimate freedom, and allowing a last pleasure, alcohol use disorders and its associated suffering can be neglected because abstinence is considered as aggressive and harmful. However, modalities of reduction of alcohol consumption as well as access control or regulated supply of alcoholic beverages, keep having a place in graduate care offers. Beyond the choice of decreasing or suppress drinking alcohol beverages, which only are terms or conditions of improvement, the main point remains the improvement of well-fare, quality of life and elders' health.",

      "title": "Alcohol use and preventing alcohol-related problems among young adults in the military",
      "abstract": "Heavy alcohol use is a significant problem in the military. Personnel often use alcohol in an attempt to cope with stress, boredom, loneliness, and the lack of other recreational activities. The easy availability of alcohol, ritualized drinking opportunities, and inconsistent policies contribute to a work culture that facilitates heavy and binge drinking in this population. Prevention strategies such as alcohol use policies combined with campaigns focusing on alcohol deglamorization, personal responsibility, and health promotion currently are being implemented to help reduce heavy alcohol use, but further research is needed to evaluate the effects of these efforts. Understanding the characteristics of military culture that encourage or allow heavy and binge drinking practices also will help in designing effective prevention approaches. KEY WORDS: military; military personnel; young adult; heavy drinking; binge drinking; causes of AODU (alcohol and other drug use); AODU susceptibility; work-related AOD issue; cultural patterns of drinking; AOD availability; workplace-based prevention; prevention of problematic AODU; targeted prevention; prevention campaign; alcoholic beverage distribution laws; expectancy; personal responsibility; health promotion ********** Relative to other substance use, heavy drinking (i.e., consuming five or more drinks per typical drinking occasion at least once a week) appears to be a particularly persistent problem in the military. Although illicit drug use and cigarette smoking both decreased significantly over the period from 1980 to 2002, heavy alcohol use did not show the same decline. In fact, heavy alcohol use increased significantly from 1998 to 2002 for the first time since 1988 (Bray et al. 2003). In 2002, 27 percent of young adults (i.e., 18- to 25-year-olds) in the military reported heavy drinking, compared with only 8.9 percent of 26- to 55-year-olds (Bray et al. 2003). Heavy drinking also is prevalent among those entering the military. A study tracking high school students into adulthood found that those who entered the military were more likely than other young adults to have been heavy drinkers in high school (Bachman et al. 1999). When controlling for marital status, living arrangements, pregnancy, and parenthood, military service itself seemed to contribute to the increases in drinking. A study of young adults entering the U.S. Navy in 1998 examined the degree to which their drinking patterns changed from pre-entry through the first 3 years of service (Ames et al. 2004). Before entering the military, approximately 26 percent of recruits (average age 19) reported frequent heavy drinking (i.e., consuming at least five drinks [for men] and at least four drinks [for women] per typical drinking occasion at least once a week throughout the previous year) (Ames et al. 2002a). At followup 2 years later, the overall prevalence of frequent heavy drinking (23 percent) within the study's cohort remained largely unchanged (Ames et al. 2004). The study found that 2 years into their military enlistment, heavy drinkers could be classified in near-equal numbers as (1) those who were pre-enlistment heavy drinkers and continued the same drinking pattern, and (2) those who were not pre-enlistment heavy drinkers but began heavy drinking after completing their training (Ames et al. 2004). These findings suggest that young adults in the military are at risk for alcohol-related problems, making them important candidates for alcohol-related prevention programs. This article reviews the prevalence of alcohol use among young adults in all four branches of the military, comparing their drinking rates with those of young adult civilians, whether or not they are enrolled full-time in college. Risk factors for heavy drinking among young adults in the military are discussed, along with strategies for reducing hazardous drinking among these young people. RATES OF ALCOHOL USE AMONG YOUNG MILITARY PERSONNEL Rates of heavy alcohol use among 18- to 25-year-old military personnel differ significantly by service branch and by gender, as shown in the accompanying table. …",

Despite these serious risks and consequences of ecstasy use among young, low-income women, the prevalence and perceptions of ecstasy use, as well as other illicit drug use, have not been adequately explored. This chapter indicates that young, low-income ecstasy users reported having more friends who used more licit and illicit drugs. It describes the characteristics of young, low-income female ecstasy users. These women perceived themselves using illicit drugs in the future, were at higher risk of continuing to use these drugs, and indicated higher levels of stress than respondents who used marijuana only or those who used other illicit drugs.",

Cannabinoids produce both physical and psychological effects, the extent of which will vary depending on patterns of use. The adverse effects of cannabinoids on physical and psychological function means that cannabis consumption can be dangerous in sports that rely on clear thinking, quick reactions and split-second timing. Particular adverse effects include somnolence, dizziness, euphoria and feelings of paranoia. Anxiety and tachycardia may also occur.

Smokeless tobacco can be used to deliver psycho-active and dependence-producing levels of nicotine. Tolerance develops with repeated use, causing the user to increase nicotine dosing through increased use and/or switching to products with higher nicotine yields. Clinical signs of nicotine withdrawal develop upon cessation of use. Recent data show that smokeless tobacco products vary widely in their nicotine dosing capabilities. Low-dose products tend to be those commonly marketed toward, and used by, young people without previous smokeless tobacco experience. Many of these people develop dependence and switch to high-dose products. The present article discusses each of these qualities of smokeless tobacco in greater detail. The article also discusses qualities of smokeless tobacco that make it an effective nicotine delivery device that leads to addiction.",

Saliva samples showing the presence of nicotine can be very helpful as evidence in a variety of situations. Salivary nicotine levels can reveal smoking habits. It offers proof of whether a person has recently used tobacco goods. Saliva testing can be used, for instance, to support or contradict smoking behaviours in court cases involving custody disputes, child endangerment, or employment regulations. Saliva nicotine testing can be used in criminal investigations to determine a suspect's smoking history. If saliva includes nicotine traces, it can be used to identify the person to a place or occasion, particularly at the crime scene which may reveal discarded cigarette butts or other tobacco-related evidence. Also, exposure to nicotine impacts general health. Saliva tests can reveal whether or not a person uses tobacco, which is important information for determining health risks. For example, nicotine testing can be used by medical practitioners to assess a patient's willingness to stop smoking or to track their progress while participating in smoking cessation programmes. Moreover, some insurance providers take nicotine usage into account when setting insurance premiums or providing coverage. Saliva test results can impact judgments about disability claims, health insurance, and life insurance. However, it's crucial to properly interpret the findings of nicotine tests. Due to the variety of benefits associated with the identification of salivary nicotine, this article aims to develop an affordable technique that can facilitate the in-situ, real-time detection of nicotine in saliva samples.",

      "abstract": "The common-sense use of the term addiction is that regular consumption is irresistible and that it creates problems. Caffeine use does not fit this profile. Its intake does no harm to the individual or to society and its users are not compelled to consume it. Though cessation of regular use may result in symptoms such as headache and lethargy, these are easily and reliably reversed by ingestion of caffeine. Some have argued that continued caffeine use is an attempt to suppress low grade withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness and lethargy. In some moderate users, this is possible; however, in experimental contexts, the phenomenon is too inconsistent to constitute a reliably valid syndrome.",

A smaller number increase excess neuronal serotonin levels by blocking serotonin reuptake or by increasing its release. All these drugs produce significantly greater weight loss than does placebo in most studies. Abuse is a problem with amphetamine, methamphetamine, and benzphetamine, whereas other drugs have minimal or no potential for abuse. Weight loss can be sustained for up to 36 months. Net weight loss, compared with placebo, ranges from 2 to 10 kg, and weight regain after terminating drug treatment proves that drugs do not work when not taken. The stigma of obesity, the public opprobrium toward obese persons, and regulatory rigidity have led to unjustified distrust in the potential of drug treatment for obesity.",

Once addicted, they were hooked by physical dependence, causing them to continue use despite wanting to quit. The new paradigm of addiction focuses on reward and the powerful experience of falling in love with the feeling that addictive behaviors produce. Potential addicts seek brain reward and are heedless of the risks, of which they are seldom ignorant. Withdrawal is largely irrelevant. The problem of addiction is the power of brain reward. The new view of addiction has important implications for prevention, treatment, public policy, and medical treatment with controlled substances.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a spiraling and debilitating condition that has severe social and economic consequences for the individual and society. Recently, much work has examined the relationship between drug addiction and the circadian timing system. The master circadian pacemaker directs a daily temporal rhythm throughout the brain and body including the consumption of alcohol. Many drugs, including alcohol, can have myriad effects at different times of day. Conversely, alcohol can alter circadian physiology at multiple levels within the system. Few studies, however, have examined the role that the timing of chronic drug exposure and withdrawal plays in the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Alcohol use, for example, follows a circadian pattern with consumption peaking in the early evening in non-dependent individuals and withdrawal likely occurring late at night. In the transition to dependence, however, craving and consumption expand earlier into the day. What consequences this altered timing of drug use plays in the physiological and psychological consequences of drug addiction remains to be seen. Herein, we specifically examine if: 1) controlling for time of day in alcohol exposure/withdrawal can alter the development of physical dependence, 2) the development of psychological dependence, and 3) if time of day can become a conditioned environmental cue that triggers craving and behavioral sensitization in an amphetamine model of addiction",

      "title": "Tobacco and smoking cessation",
      "abstract": "Background: Tobacco products have been used by human for a long history. The prevalence of tobacco use varies in different countries. Tobacco use is different from tobacco use disorder. Tobacco use disorder is a problematic pattern of tobacco use leading to significant distress or impairment. Cigarette smoking is a chronic relapsing substance use disorder caused by addiction to nicotine. Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 different chemical compounds, of which 93 of them are harmful substances. Methods: In this review, the authors intended to address the issues of harmful effects of cigarette smoking and how to cease smoking. Results: Abundant studies showed that tobacco use is the main risk factor of morbidity and mortality in the world. People who use tobacco products should be advised to quit smoking and offered appropriate treatment. It is better for health-care providers to make the smoking cessation treatment as a standard component of medical care. Data from evidence-based literature showed that smoking cessation therapy can significantly raise smoking cessation rates and should be routinely in persons who are willing to quit tobacco smoking. Smoking cessation treatment includes psychosocial interventions and pharmacological treatment, which may be used in combination. Nonpharmacological management may be individual or group sessions, and it may include motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and others. Delivery formats of stop-smoking interventions are varied. Pharmacological therapy includes nicotine replacement treatment and smoking aids such as bupropion and varenicline. Morbidity and mortality rates are decreased with tobacco cessation at any point in time, although cessation before the age of 40 years has the most significant effect. Conclusion: The Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act took effect since 1997 in Taiwan. Rates of Taiwanese tobacco use have been steadily declining. Brilliant achievements in the field of tobacco control in Taiwan draw international attention.",

The drug may no longer be needed; it may not have produced the desired effect; it may have produced an adverse reaction; a better drug may be available to replace the original drug. The patient may have discontinued the drug because he or she could not see why it was necessary; or the patient may have discontinued the drug because of unpleasant side effects. A drug may not work because its absorption is reduced by physical or chemical interaction with another drug or a food component. It may also not work because the patient's metabolism is speeded up or in hibited to an extent such that the desired duration of drug action is not obtained. Such an effect may be related to a change in diet. Side effects may be related to consumption of specific foods or bev erages or to an overall change in nutritional status. Drug-food and drug-alcohol incompatibility reactions are frequent but are avoidable if a patient is warned of their possible occurrence. Drugs may also produce nutritional deficiencies, especially in a patient whose diet is marginal in those nutrients depleted by the particular drug. Careful prescribing practices together with appropriate nutrient supplements will serve to reduce the risk of these incompatibilities.",

Data BNN menunjukkan banyaknya penyalahgunaan narkoba pada generasi milenial atau generasi muda yang angkanya terus meningkat. Kota Tegal merupakan salah satu wilayah di Jawa Tengah yang memiliki jumlah penduduk dengan rentang usia remaja yang cukup besar, yang sangat potensial untuk dapat dijadikan sebagai tempat peredaran narkoba. Badan Narkotika Nasional (BNN) menyatakan penyalahgunaan dan peredaran narkotika di masyarakat menunjukkan peningkatan dengan meluasnya korban akibat narkoba. Tingginya paparan narkotika pada remaja perlu mendapatkan perhatian adalah bahwa target utama pasar narkotika ini adalah para remaja. Kalangan remaja yang terpapar narkotika lebih rentan sebagai pengguna jangka panjang, karena mereka memiliki waktu yang cukup panjang dalam mengkonsumsi narkoba. Dampak penggunaan narkoba ternyata dapat menimbulkan masalah lain yang tidak kalah mengerikan, sehingga penanganan penyalahgunaan narkoba perlu mendapatkan pehatian yang serius. Penanganan yang bersifat promotif dan preventif perlu dikedepankan sebelum dilakukan tindakan represif. Melibatkan secara aktif remaja dalam upaya penanganan yang bersifat promotif dan preventif merupakan salah satu solusi untuk mengurangi penyebaran Narkoba di kalangan remaja.Tujuan dari dilaksanakannya pengabdian masyarakat di Kelurahan Debong Kulon ini adalah untuk meningkatkan peran dan partisipasi mitra (remaja) dalam kegiatan P4GN, meningkatkan pengetahuan remaja terkait kegiatan P4GN dan meningkatkan motivasi remaja dalam kegiatan P4GN. Sedangkan manfaat yang ingin dicapai dari kegiatan ini adalah mitra (remaja) dapat berpartisipasi aktif dalam kegiatan P4GN dan dapat termotivasi untuk teribat dalam kegiatan P4GN. Untuk mencapai tujuan kegiatan pengabdian masyarakat di Kelurahan Debong Kulon Kota Tegal, dilakukan melalui beberapa pendekatan, antara lain dengan Model Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), Model Community development, Persuasif dan Edukatif.

Para entender el mecanismo del hábito de fumar debemos considerar que fumar representa mucho más que la dependencia física a la nicotina. Con el paso del tiempo el fumador pasa a recibir estímulos sociales, comportamentales o culturales que refuerzan su hábito y probablemente serán los elementos causantes del establecimiento de la dependencia psicológica.

Perhaps it is this latter element - the feeling of pleasure - that poses one of the greatest challenges to the development of successful drug strategies and health promotion messages.

Pruebas científicas indican que los productos varían ampliamente en la cantidad de nicotina y otros productos químicos contenidos, porque no hay forma que los consumidores descubran lo que realmente contiene el producto que ha comprado.

Penyalahgunaan narkoba memang sulit diberantas, karena banyak factor dan manusia yang berperan. Yang dapat dilakukan adalah mencegah dan mengendalikan agar masalahnya tidak meluas, sehingga merugikan masa depan bangsa, karena merosotnya kualitas sumber daya manusia terutama generasi mudanya.\r\nPenyalahgunaan narkoba berkaitan erat dengan peredaran gelap sebagai bagian dari dunia kejahatan internasional. Mafia perdagangan gelap mamasok narkoba, agar orang memiliki ketergantungan sehingga jumlah suplai meningkat. Terjalin hubungan antara pengedar/Bandar dan korban. Korban sulit melepaskan diri dari mereka, bahkan tak jarang mereka terlibat peredaran gelap, karena meningkatnya kebutuhan narkoba.\r\nPenderita ketergantungan obat-obatan terlarang atau kini umumnya berusia 15-24 tahun. Kebanyakan mereka masih aktif di sekolah menengah pertama, sekolah menengah atas, atau perguruan tinggi. Bahkan ada pula yang masih duduk di bangku sekolah dasar.\r\nPenyalahgunaan narkoba biasanya diawali dengan pemakaian pertama pada usia SD atau SMP, karena tawaran, bujukan, dan tekanan seseorang atau kawan sebaya. Di dorong pula oleh rasa ingin tahu dan rasa ingin mencoba, mereka menerima bujukan tersebut. Selanjutnya akan dengan mudahnya untuk dipengaruhi menggunakan lagi, yang pada akhirnya menyandu obat-obatan terlarang dan ketergantungan pada obat-obatan terlarang. Hal-hal inilah yang melatar belakangi Akademi Farmasi Bhumi Husada Jakarta untuk melakukan penyuluhan tentang “Bahaya Penyalahgunaan Narkoba Pada Mahasiswa AkFar Bhumi Jakarta”.\r\n Tujuan\r\n\r\nTujuan Umum\r\n\r\nSebagai salah satu bentuk implementasi dari pelaksanaan Tri Dharma Perguruan Tinggi.\r\n\r\nTujuan KhususAgar generasi muda mengerti apa yang dimaksud narkoba.Meningkatkan pengetahuan generasi muda tentang  dampak-dampak dari penggunaan narkoba.",

Social habits, examples, deprivation of senses, dullness, anxiety, stress, and smoking as a symbol of status play a major role. 3.

The consumption of addictive goods seems, therefore, to be the anti-thesis of rational behavior. In this paper, however, it is demonstrated that a rational individual, in the sense that he maximizes his well-being while anticipating the future consequences of his choices, may in fact choose to consume addictive goods. Specifically, the two-good extension of the rational addiction model is demonstrated and related to relevant policy questions. For instance, should one encourage the use of smokeless tobacco in smoking cessation programs? According to the empirical results, the answer is no. Further, should one discourage smoking by increasing the tax on cigarettes? Again, the answer is no.",

      "title": "[Why stopping smoking is difficult in patients suffering from schizophrenia? How better to take care of them?]",
      "abstract": "Smoking is much higher among patients suffering from schizophrenia compared to the general population. These patients inhale the smoke more deeply and extract a significant amount of nicotine from the cigarette. They are highly addicted to tobacco and their attempts to stop smoking are more frequently marked by failures. The continuation of consumption exposes them particularly to the risk of diseases and mortality related to smoking. Various hypotheses are advanced to explain the association between schizophrenia and tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke and/or nicotine appear to compensate for certain cognitive deficits due to the disease or to correct adverse events of anti-psychotics. Furthermore, genetic factors, personality traits and socio-cultural factors appear to be jointly implicated in mental illness and smoking. Smoking cessation, which does not aggravate schizophrenia, combines psycho-social approaches and medication treatments; it can be helped by the use of the electronic cigarette and the practice of physical exercise. Professionals must ensure long-term personalized follow-up.La consommation de tabac est beaucoup plus élevée parmi les patients souffrant de schizophrénie comparativement à la population générale. Ces patients inhalent plus profondément la fumée et extraient une importante quantité de nicotine de la cigarette. Ils présentent une forte dépendance tabagique et leurs tentatives d’arrêt du tabac sont plus fréquemment marquées par des échecs. La poursuite de la consommation les expose particulièrement au risque de maladies et de mortalité en lien avec le tabagisme. Diverses hypothèses sont avancées pour expliquer l’association entre la schizophrénie et le tabagisme : le tabagisme et/ou la nicotine paraissent compenser certains déficits cognitifs dus à la maladie ou corriger des événements indésirables des anti-psychotiques. De plus, des facteurs génétiques, des traits de personnalité et des facteurs sociaux culturels paraissent conjointement impliqués dans la maladie mentale et l’usage du tabac. Le sevrage tabagique qui n’aggrave pas la maladie associe les prises en charge psycho-sociales et les médicaments d’aide à l’arrêt; il peut être aidé par l’usage de la cigarette électronique et la pratique de l’exercice physique. Les professionnels doivent assurer un suivi personnalisé de longue durée.",

Its use has been reported to be overrepresented in many psychiatric conditions and has frequently been found to predate the onset of psychiatric symptoms. However, cannabis may also have detrimental effects on the general population. Factors that predict the onset of use are receiving increased attention to aid in identifying groups of young people who may be more prone to consume cannabis. Personality traits may be one such factor as they are readily identifiable and offer information that can be used for improved targeting of educational material about the effects of cannabis use. This review summarizes the role that personality traits may play in cannabis use, with a focus on impulsivity and schizotypy, both of which have been extensively studied for their contribution in this setting. Additionally, other traits and the potential overlap between personality traits are highlighted. The wider implications of a better understanding of personality traits and cannabis use for cannabis research are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is an evocative psychological and medical term whose meaning has changed significantly over time. For most of this century it has been described in terms of an abstinence syndrome (dependence and withdrawal) and associated with heroin use. In the 1980s, however, cocaine replaced heroin as the prototypical drug of abuse. Cocaine had heretofore not been considered to produce “physical dependence.” Nonetheless, for both cocaine and heroin, current models of addiction — models widely propagated by the media —reduce drug use patterns to the properties of drugs and biological characteristics of the user. In creating this model, scientific and clinical debates along with public debates rely on the supposedly typical, inevitably addicting results of repeated cocaine consumption. Yet naturalistic human drug use and drug taking by animals in the laboratory instead reinforce the picture that use of all drugs depends on the user's environment-Indeed, even the most severe examples of compulsive drug use can be reversed when key elements in the setting are modified. Such findings should by now play a fundamental role in both scientific and public conceptions of addiction, but they do not.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Consumption of drugs by human beings has had a long history, extending millennia before the first written accounts of wine consumption or the smoking of opium. Because drugs take so many different forms and are consumed in so many different ways, the most inclusive definition of “drug” is desirable. Alcohol is certainly a component of human drug repertoires, and archaeological evidence indicates that it is one of the most ancient of plant‐derived drugs. Human trends in drug consumption have moved in the direction of increasing purity and potency of plant‐derived preparations, for example, distilled spirits that evolved from fermented brews of grape juice, malt water, or corn mash. Concepts of drug abuse and drug dependence emerged as potent preparations gained popularity and established perceptions of chronic intoxication. Both of these terms appear aimed at denoting consumers of drugs who are not necessarily addicted to them. “Drug abuse” and “alcohol abuse” have become parts of the names of two national agencies in the United States dedicated to the study of drug‐using patterns. “Drug dependence” denotes a condition similar to addiction but without the additional stigma of vulnerability to withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Some abstinent smokers develop withdrawal symptoms when they stop using nicotine gum or when placebo is substituted; thus, physical dependence on nicotine gum does occur. Some smokers also use nicotine gum beyond the recommended period; thus, behavioral dependence on the gum occurs. Many (7–41 %) smokers misuse nicotine gum by smoking cigarettes and chewing the gum concurrently. Among smokers who stop using the gum, many (35–90 %) do not stop gum use by the recommended 3 months, and a substantial percentage (13–38 %) persist in gum use for 1 year. Among quitters, long-term use of nicotine gum appears to be greater than that of placebo gum. If rapidity of onset and frequency of use are determinants of dependence potential, then nasal sprays and aerosols but not nicotine patches should have dependence potential. There are no reports of misuse of the gum by non-smokers; thus, the gum appears to have little if any abuse liability.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a spiraling and debilitating condition that has severe social and economic consequences for the individual and society. Recently, much work has examined the relationship between drug addiction and the circadian timing system. The master circadian pacemaker directs a daily temporal rhythm throughout the brain and body including the consumption of alcohol. Many drugs, including alcohol, can have myriad effects at different times of day. Conversely, alcohol can alter circadian physiology at multiple levels within the system. Few studies, however, have examined the role that the timing of chronic drug exposure and withdrawal plays in the development and maintenance of drug addiction. Alcohol use, for example, follows a circadian pattern with consumption peaking in the early evening in non-dependent individuals and withdrawal likely occurring late at night. In the transition to dependence, however, craving and consumption expand earlier into the day. What consequences this altered timing of drug use plays in the physiological and psychological consequences of drug addiction remains to be seen. Herein, we specifically examine if: 1) controlling for time of day in alcohol exposure/withdrawal can alter the development of physical dependence, 2) the development of psychological dependence, and 3) if time of day can become a conditioned environmental cue that triggers craving and behavioral sensitization in an amphetamine model of addiction",

Decreased olfaction has been an often reported subjective complaint of cocaine abusers, but quantification of smell loss using sensitive psychophysical tests has not yet been done, leading to the present study. Eleven cocaine abusers were recruited from a drug treatment clinic. Olfaction was assessed using a butanol threshold test, the UPSIT, and a 7-item discrimination test. One patient tested anosmic, one had a mild discrimination problem, and one had a large septal perforation but was normosmic. From the present study, it appears that most cocaine abusers, even heavy users or those with intranasal damage, do not develop permanent olfactory dysfunction. It is not clear what factors may have resulted in complaints of olfactory loss in previous studies.",

      "title": "Alkohol oder Haschisch. Was ist gefaehrlicher",
      "abstract": "Die gesundheitlichen Schaedigungen infolge Alkohol- und Cannabiskonsum werden im Einzelnen diskutiert. Es hat sich eindeutig herauskristallisiert, dass beide Suchtstoffe in Mengen genossen aeusserst schaedlich sind und zum Tode fuehren koennen. Die Todesrate durch Alkohol ist zweifelsohne gross. Von Cannabis wird nur in einzelnen Faellen auf moegliche Herzkomplikationen hingewiesen, die toedlich sein koennten. Wodurch Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) aber zum Tod fuehren kann, ist die enorme Beguenstigung des Suizids. Die Ausloesung psychogener Ausnahmesituationen, zum Beispiel mit Verfolgungswahn, kann das Ergebnis von Cannabiskonsum sein. Aber auch geringe Dosen Cannabis oder der erstmalige Konsum haben unter Umstaenden ganz erhebliche Fehl- und Angstreaktionen zur Folge. Schliesslich ist die Krebsgenese durch das Rauchen von Marihuana oder Haschisch etwa um das Vierfache groesser als durch den Genuss normaler Zigaretten. Insgesamt ist die Todesrate bei chronischen Alkoholkonsumenten grosser Quantitaeten immer noch erheblich groesser als die durch den Genuss von THC. Anders ist es bei der Einnahme von kleinen Mengen. Hier gefaehrdet Alkohol nur in seltenen Faellen die Gesundheit, waehrend Cannabis nicht selten bereits beim ersten Mal oder in den folgenden Rauscherlebnissen psychische Stoerungen ausloest. Mit der relativ niedrigen Konzentration von weniger als 5 ng THC/ml Blutserum sind die psychischen Beeintraechtigungen ohne koerperliche Ausfallerscheinungen derart gross, dass es zu schweren, sogar toedlichen Verkehrsunfaellen kommt. 5 Nanogramm THC in einem Milliliter Blutserum entsprechen ungefaehr einer Blutalkoholkonzentration von 0,5 Promille. Eine zitierte Untersuchung stellte fest, dass bei Verkehrsunfaellen unter Cannabiseinwirkung 65,5 Prozent der Fahrer einen THC-Gehalt von unter 5 Nanogramm hatten, sie haetten damit allgemein unter der relativen Fahruntuechtigkeit von 0,5 Promille im Blut gelegen.",

Most smokers in the United States say they would like to quit smoking. Why are some successful and others not? A central issue in understanding and treating drug dependence is the source of individual differences in the initiation and maintenance of drug use.Drug addiction is a complex process involving the interplay between the pharmacology of a psychoactive drug, family and peer influences, personality, existing psychiatric disorders, the cost and availability of the drug, the influence of advertising, and other factors. . . .",

      "abstract": "Caffeine, nicotine, ethanol and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are among the most prevalent and culturally accepted drugs in western society. For example, in Europe and North America up to 90% of the adult population drinks coffee daily and, although less prevalent, the other drugs are also used extensively by the population. Smoked tobacco, excessive alcohol consumption and marijuana (cannabis) smoking are addictive and exhibit adverse health effects. These drugs are not only common in the general population, but have also made their way into elite sports because of their purported performance-altering potential. Only one of the drugs (i.e., caffeine) has enough scientific evidence indicating an ergogenic effect. There is some preliminary evidence for nicotine as an ergogenic aid, but further study is required; cannabis and alcohol can exhibit ergogenic potential under specific circumstances but are in general believed to be ergolytic for sports performance. These drugs are currently (THC, ethanol) or have been (caffeine) on the prohibited list of the World Anti-Doping Agency or are being monitored (nicotine) due to their potential ergogenic or ergolytic effects. The aim of this brief review is to evaluate the effects of caffeine, nicotine, ethanol and THC by: 1) examining evidence supporting the ergogenic or ergolytic effects; 2) providing an overview of the mechanism(s) of action and physiological effects; and 3) where appropriate, reviewing their impact as performance-altering aids used in recreational and elite sports.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine users are at greater risk of developing alcohol dependence. Conversely, alcohol is often consumed when young people test tobacco. The prevalence of smokers is high among alcohol dependent individuals and people who overconsume alcohol get more nicotine withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit tobacco and are less likely to succeed. Alcohol as well as smoking provides a high burden of disease, and combined use often causes multiplier damage effects. Alcohol dependent persons die more often from smoking-related illness than from alcohol. Nicotine cessation is more successful if alcohol advice is included. Cross-tolerance and other interactions between nicotine and opioids increase the likelihood of dependence. Tobacco smokers need higher opioid doses against pain. Despite evidence of association between smoking and chronic pain, understanding of causality is limited. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of opioid dependence. Nicotine is recognized as an important underlying factor. Further research in humans concerning the interactions between nicotine and opioids is urgent. Treatment of nicotine dependence in the medical management of opioid dependence seems promising, but at what point in the course - simultaneously, shortly after, or far behind - has yet to be determined.",

      "abstract": "Acute marijuana use is classically associated with snacking behavior (colloquially referred to as \"the munchies\"). In support of these acute appetite-enhancing effects, several authorities report that marijuana may increase body mass index in patients suffering from human immunodeficiency virus and cancer. However, for these medical conditions, while appetite may be stimulated, some studies indicate that weight gain is not always clinically meaningful. In addition, in a study of cancer patients in which weight gain did occur, it was less than the comparator drug (megestrol). However, data generally suggest that acute marijuana use stimulates appetite, and that marijuana use may stimulate appetite in low-weight individuals. As for large epidemiological studies in the general population, findings consistently indicate that users of marijuana tend to have lower body mass indices than nonusers. While paradoxical and somewhat perplexing, these findings may be explained by various study confounds, such as potential differences between acute versus chronic marijuana use; the tendency for marijuana use to be associated with other types of drug use; and/or the possible competition between food and drugs for the same reward sites in the brain. Likewise, perhaps the effects of marijuana are a function of initial weight status-i.e., maybe marijuana is a metabolic regulatory substance that increases body weight in low-weight individuals but not in normal-weight or overweight individuals. Only further research will clarify the complex relationships between marijuana and body weight.",

Both the type of product and the general health of the population determine the outcome. All tobacco products contain carcinogenic substances and substantial quantities of nicotine. Nicotine has, apart from its psychoactive properties, abundant vasoregulatory effects through the mediation of cholinergic as well as adrenergic stimuli. Studies of the effects of snuff or snus use in developed countries have shown a moderate risk for cancer, cardiovascular mortality and metabolic diseases, such as type II diabetes. Also, snus use during pregnancy has been found to be a health risk for the newborn baby. The evidence, therefore, suggests that although snuff and snus are less hazardous than smoked tobacco, the most deadly of all consumer products, there is indeed reason to be cautious about the use of smokeless tobacco.",

      "title": "To Your Health: Sensible Self-Care Can Help CPAs Maintain Stamina in the Run-Up to Those Filing Deadlines",
      "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY * Long busy-season hours give CPA's so little time for exercise or regular meals that stress can build. This can weaken a person's immune system and make him or her more prone to illness. The overload also can diminish employee performance and lead to low morale, absenteeism and high turnover among staff members. * CPAs CAN TAKE SIMPLE STEPS--both at home and at work--to develop healthful habits that mitigate stress, sustain energy and make staying fit throughout busy season an attainable goal. * TO SUPPORT STAMINA AND CONCENTRATION, a CPA with a heavy workload needs to eat when his or her body signals hunger and keep healthful, high-protein snacks in the office. * A CPA WHO CAN'T GET TO A GYM or hasn't used one can relieve stress by doing small amounts of exercise such as 10 minutes at home in the morning and another 10 minutes after work. Simple, accessible activities such as a brisk walk, a bike ride or boxing/dance moves to upbeat music will work. * IN THE OFFICE, CPAs CAN USE SHORT BREAKS for stretches, push-ups, sit-ups, toe touches and other exercises that don't require equipment. They also can take the stairs instead of the elevator or walk to lunch or to a client meeting. * A PROFESSIONAL TRAINER CAN PUT TOGETHER an exercise plan to help CPAs get the most out of their time and keep workouts safe and balanced. Once learned, routines can be done at work or at home. Long hours, especially from January to April, take their toll on CPAs. Busy season leaves so little time for exercise or regular, balanced meals that what we eat when we get a break may make us more lethargic than energetic. On top of that, the nonstop deadline pressure triggers stress, affecting everyone in the firm--from partners to staff--mentally, emotionally and physically. Such stress can lead to biochemical imbalances that weaken our immune systems, make us more prone to illness and confer a hidden--and high--cost of working in our profession. In the office environment, it contributes to diminished employee performance, low morale, conflicts, absenteeism and high turnover. Staying fit throughout busy season is attainable for everyone, however. Here are some helpful strategies I learned during my six years in the trenches at KPMG LLP. FUEL FOR THOUGHT Some things CPAs can do to mitigate stress are easier than you might think. For example, eating the right foods (particularly those high in protein) strengthens your immune system, lowers blood pressure and stabilizes your energy levels. To develop good nutritional habits that support stamina and concentration, try to * Eat when you're hungry. This may seem obvious, but it isn't common practice. Many busy people go to work in the morning without breakfast or work through lunch because they believe they don't have time for a meal. Eating when you're hungry--not starved--helps to lessen stress and control weight gain. * Keep it simple. Breakfast and lunch don't have to be elaborate to maintain energy. The proteins and carbohydrates in protein bars, fruit, cheese, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs or peanut butter on toast are sufficient. Foods that are complete proteins, such as nuts, meat or eggs, have all the amino acids your body needs to construct new proteins. Studies say they tend to stave off hunger longer. * Don't wait too long between meals. This leads to unpleasant hunger, characterized by headaches, fatigue, lack of concentration and irritability. If you wait until you feel starved, you'll overeat at the next meal. Eat at regular intervals. Set an alarm or use a kitchen timer to signal when it's time for a food break if you're likely to become immersed in your work. * Stop eating before you feel stuffed. Learn to recognize when you're no longer truly hungry. The stomach is about the size of a large baked potato, so a body has met its needs long before a stretched feeling in the stomach signals stop. …",

Un petit pourcentage d’usagers réguliers rapporte une dépendance au cannabis mais ce désordre ne semble pas aussi aversif que la dépendance à d’autres drogues. Le cannabis semble avoir moins d’effets négatifs sur la santé que les drogues légales comme l’alcool, la caféine ou le tabac et il tue moins de personnes. Les impacts négatifs des pénalités imposées à la possession de cannabis semblent dépasser les impacts négatifs de la drogue elle-même, suggérant que la politique anti-drogue des Etats-Unis pourrait être améliorée en décriminalisant la possession de cannabis et en permettant à chaque adulte de cultiver quatre plants pour son usage personnel.

      "abstract": "Smokers of any age can reap substantial health benefits by quitting. In fact, no other single public health effort is likely to achieve a benefit comparable to large-scale smoking cessation. Surveys document that most smokers would like to quit, and many have made repeated efforts to do so. However, conventional smoking cessation approaches require nicotine addicted smokers to abstain from tobacco and nicotine entirely. Many smokers are unable – or at least unwilling – to achieve this goal, and so they continue smoking in the face of impending adverse health consequences. In effect, the status quo in smoking cessation presents smokers with just two unpleasant alternatives: quit or suffer the harmful effects of continuing smoking. But, there is a third choice for smokers: tobacco harm reduction. It involves the use of alternative sources of nicotine, including modern smokeless tobacco products like snus and the electronic cigarette (E-cig), or even pharmaceutical nicotine products, as a replacement for smoking. E-cigs might be the most promising product for tobacco harm reduction to date, because, besides delivering nicotine vapour without the combustion products that are responsible for nearly all of smoking's damaging effect, they also replace some of the rituals associated with smoking behaviour. Thus it is likely that smokers who switch to E-cigs will achieve large health gains. The focus of this article is on the health effects of using an E-cig, with consideration given to the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of this product as a long-term substitute for smoking.",

Para dormir, tomamos somniferos; para paliar nuestras carencias en la vida de relacion, se acude al tabaco, al alcohol o al cannabis; para serenarnos tras la batalla, volvemos a los tranquilizantes; para rendir en el estudio o en el trabajo, se tomaba antes la centramina. En las mananas de los lunes, cuando se piensa en lo que queda hasta esa ilusion que es el fin de semana, un abanico de estimulantes/relajantes se extiende por el camino. No se conocen en su justa medida las razones por las que se tiende al consumo de sustancias que afectan en mayor o menor medida a nuestra actividad basal. La drogadiccion en sentido amplio, como cualquier comportamiento irregular, se acostumbra a explicar en terminos de disfuncion sociologica (el sistema social, en su defectuosidad, es el que propicia el consumo de drogas), de caracter (las limitaciones de muchos individuos para la integracion social les motiva a usar productos artificiales), o biologica (un deficit de dopamina en la composicion cerebral estimula la ingesta). Pero que porcion de cada una de estas explicaciones concurre en el dependiente de productos psicoadictivos, es algo que no se sabe con seguridad.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents consume alcohol in moderation mainly to enjoy and enhance mood but adolescents also drink hazardously, e.g. to cope with stressful life events. Drinking hazardously may be related to the developing adolescent brain going through a number of structural and physiological changes. These structural and physiological changes affect adolescent behavior aimed at gaining experience in life. Adolescent drinking patterns vary and may include risky behaviors such as binge drinking. Motivations to drink and risk factors for binge drinking and alcohol abuse are both internal and external. Internal risk factors include amongst others genetic predisposition to have less self-control, whereas external risk factors includes early life stress. Integrative approaches underline the value of multi-domain analysis for prediction; any one feature in isolation only modestly predicts drinking behavior. Health consequences of drinking vary widely depending on dose and drinking pattern. Moderate alcohol drinking may be associated with a lower incidence of chronic disease and mental health, whereas alcohol binging and abuse appear to negatively affect social functioning mainly in the short term and mental and physical health in the long term. Resilience towards behaving non responsibly may best prevent alcohol abuse and stimulate enjoyment of moderate alcohol consumption. Limitations in current knowledge concern the interpretation of alcohol drinking being the cause for adolescent risky behavior, generalizability of findings on abusing adolescents to the general population and insufficient knowledge of relevant covariates and mediators.",

The extent of therapeutic use is examined relative to the incidence of disorders associated with anxiety and it is concluded that, in general, the benzodiazepines are used conservatively by doctors rather than overused, and that their current consumption is not excessive relative to the level of emotional morbidity in the community. However, as with all psychoactive substances, dependence, both psychological and physical, can occur. This is of the alcohol-barbiturate type, though of less severity. The incidence of dependence under both therapeutic and abuse circumstance is quantified and found to be very low. The social significance of this level of dependence is examined relative to both the overall reliance of society on pleasure-giving activities, and the puritan ethics still applicable to mental illnesses. Conclusions are drawn about appropriate action that might be taken to reduce dependence.",

This review will focus on the clinical presentation and complications of these two common inadvertent ingestions in children, as well as recent regulatory efforts and advocacy opportunities. Recent Findings The rising incidence of cannabis toxicity in children has corresponded with its legalization across several countries in the last decade. Inadvertent pediatric cannabis intoxication is most commonly due to the ingestion of edible forms discovered by children in their own home. The clinical presentation can be nonspecific, therefore clinicians should have a low threshold for including it on their differential diagnosis. Button battery ingestions are also increasing in incidence. While many children are asymptomatic at presentation, button battery ingestions can quickly cause esophageal injury and lead to several serious and potentially life-threatening complications. Prompt recognition and removal of esophageal button batteries is essential for reducing harm. Summary Cannabis and button battery ingestions are important for physicians who take care of children to recognize and manage appropriately. Given their rising incidence, there are many opportunities for policy improvements and advocacy efforts to make a difference in preventing these ingestions altogether.",

Recent experimental trends, such as microdosing, have helped promote the use of hallucinogens on campus, and students may be tempted to use these substances due to their beliefs about the drugs’ positive effects on mood. Although hallucinogens are not currently an established form of medical therapy, studies have shown that they have significant benefits as adjunctive treatments for psychological disorders. However, the recreational use of these drugs in college students often occurs in uncontrolled doses or with drug mixing, which is often dangerous. Furthermore, students with mental health disorders may have their symptoms masked by hallucinogenic drug use, which could delay treatment and have serious consequences. Long-term use of these drugs may also result in tolerance or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. This article attempts to review current information regarding hallucinogen use and how it applies to the college population.",

Special attention has been given those factors which mediate the wide individual differences in consumption patterns, susceptibility to abuse, and the varied psychological and physiological responses to this drug.

Due to its structural similarities with psychostimulants, bupropion is suggested to have addictive potential. Several case reports have been published addressing its misuse in recent years, mainly through nasal insufflation and intravenous administration. Most of the reported cases cited a history of substance use disorder. Methods Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to write this case report. Case presentation We present a case with alcohol use disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, who developed a substance use disorder to bupropion while chewing it in doses up to 2250 mg, in an attempt to get “high” with no history of seizures. Discussion Our case suggests that bupropion can also be misused by chewing even at high doses and that it can lead to a substance use disorder. Its use in various indications in treating mental disorders and its over-the-counter accessibility, along with a lower risk of stigmatization, could increase the prevalence of bupropion misuse. It is essential to know the medical consequences of bupropion misuse as there is increasing data on its addictive potential. More information is needed to clarify the impact of the route of administration on drug metabolism and adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Use of phencyclidine is a diverse phenomenon with wide variations in both the amount taken and the frequency of use. There is a large group of persons who have tried PCP once or twice and discontinued using. One of the key distinctions pointed out by this exploratory study relates to the feelings of control persons have over the effects of the drug. The PCP user who is not bothered by the lack of control is more likely to feel good and party with others when using and is more likely to have high use patterns. Feelings of control over the effects of PCP indicate an important individual difference in understanding reactions to PCP use and further research should systematically examine this phenomenon. There has been a discrepancy between our conceptions of PCP use and the actual patterns of use found in the United States. It appears that at this time most persons in the drug abuse field are willing to accept the fact that PCP is a drug of choice among young people and that some as yet unspecified proportion of users is able to use PCP and avoid major problems. While there remains much speculation about the motivation for use and the effects of such use, it would apper that we are ready to engage in research which systematically looks at the spectrum of users.",

However, excessive use can cause various symptoms and, in severe cases, can even be life-threatening. A 34-year-old man with a reported history of psychiatric disorders was found unresponsive at his girlfriend's house and transported to an emergency department. He was presumed to have taken several caffeine pills and was pronounced dead approximately six hours later. There was no evidence of trauma or natural diseases at autopsy. Toxicology testing on hospital blood samples revealed toxic levels of caffeine and methamphetamine. After investigation of the circumstances surrounding the death and accounting for the autopsy and toxicology findings, the cause and manner of death were certified as combined caffeine and methamphetamine toxicity and accident, respectively. Lethal levels of caffeine have been reported when blood concentration exceeds 80 mg/L. Caution is needed to avoid excessive caffeine intake, especially when consumed in concentrated forms like tablets or powders. Caffeine should be used with care not only in cases of cardiovascular disease or genetic vulnerability but also for those with psychiatric disorders. Although deaths from caffeine are rare, they are consistently reported, necessitating attention and caution in its use.",

      "title": "What’s Pain Got To Do With It?: Young Adults With and Without Chronic Pain Perceive Minimal Risks and Moderate Benefits from Cannabis Use",
      "abstract": "Many young adults experience chronic pain and given its wide availability and potential pain reducing properties, young adults may use cannabis to self-medicate for pain. However, little is known about young adult users’ perceptions of potential health risks and benefits of cannabis, and whether these perceptions differ by chronic pain status. As a part of a larger study, young adult recreational cannabis users (N=176, ages 18-29) who reported using at least once a week completed assessments of use frequency and perceived cannabis-related risks and benefits. The sample had a high proportion of participants who met criteria for chronic pain (51.1%). The majority of the sample reported using daily or multiple times daily (80.7%) with an average of 2.68 (SD=1.42) sessions per day across administration modes (e.g. smoking, edibles, tinctures). Participants answered questions about their lifetime chances of experiencing five cannabis-related risks (personal harm, negative health outcome, negative mental health outcome, harming someone else, increased pain) and benefits (personal benefit, positive health outcome, positive mental health outcome, benefitting someone else, decreased pain; 1=Very low to 7=Very high). Overall, young adult users perceived their risk to be very low (M=1.62, SD=.73) and 40.3% of the sample had an average risk score (combined across the five risk items) of 1.00, while only one participant reported an average risk above 4.00. In particular, participants reported a low lifetime chance of experiencing personal harm (M=1.51, SD=.90), harming someone else (M=1.20, SD=.58), or experiencing increased pain (M=1.24, SD=.74) due to their cannabis use. In contrast, young adult users perceived somewhat high chances of experiencing benefits related to their cannabis use (M=4.78, SD=1.46). In particular, participants perceived a high chance of experiencing reduced pain (M=5.88, SD=1.55), personal benefit (M=4.84, SD=1.86), and positive mental health outcomes (M=4.82, SD=1.77). There was no difference based on pain status on frequency of use, average daily sessions, or perceived risks, and only one difference in perceived benefits. Participants without chronic pain anticipated more personal benefit from cannabis use (M=5.15, SD=1.74) than those with chronic pain (M=4.53, SD=1.94, t(171)=2.21, p=.03). Overall, results suggest young adult recreational users perceive very low risks of their cannabis consumption and moderately high benefits, regardless of pain status. Looking at individual areas of potential risk and benefits may yield targets for future health education campaigns. For example, perceptions of low risk/high benefits regarding mental health outcomes may not be accurate for this heavy using sample.",

      "title": "Alcohol use and motivations for drinking among types of young adult illicit stimulant users",
      "abstract": "Drinking among young adult users of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) during episodes of ecstasy and methamphetamine use is reported to have a number of possible functions, such as mitigating the unwanted effects of the drugs, enhancing intoxication and pleasure, and increasing drinking capacity. While there is evidence to suggest a high prevalence of risky drinking among users of ATS in Australia, little is known about how they combine their use of ATS with the consumption of alcohol or why they do so. This paper considers how ATS users consume alcohol during ecstasy and methamphetamine use, and also addresses alcohol abuse and dependence among low-risk and at-risk ATS users. At-risk users are more likely to have experienced alcohol abuse and dependence during adolescence or early adulthood, suggesting that higher-risk use of ATS may be linked with problematic drinking patterns. The paper suggests that problematic behaviour relating to alcohol and ATS use is interlinked, and may be important in developing appropriate policy responses.",

      "title": "Adolescent Ethanol Exposure: Anxiety-Like Behavioral Alterations, Ethanol Intake, and Sensitivity",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period associated with rapid age-specific physiological, neural, and hormonal changes. Behaviorally, human adolescents are characterized by age-typical increases in novelty seeking and risk taking, including the frequent initiation of alcohol and drug use. Alcohol use typically begins during early adolescence, and older adolescents often report high levels of alcohol consumption, commonly referred to as high-intensity drinking. Early-onset and heavy drinking during adolescence are associated with an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorders later in life. Yet, long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent alcohol use that might contribute to excessive drinking in adulthood are still not well understood. Recent animal research, however, using different exposure regimens and routes of ethanol administration, has made substantial progress in identifying the consequences of adolescent ethanol exposure that last into adulthood. Alterations associated with adolescent ethanol exposure include increases in anxiety-like behavior, impulsivity, risk taking, and ethanol intake, although the observed alterations differ as a function of exposure regimens and routes of ethanol administration. Rodent studies have also shown that adolescent ethanol exposure produces alterations in sensitivity to ethanol, with these alterations reminiscent of adolescent-typical ethanol responsiveness. The goal of this mini-review is to summarize the current state of animal research, focusing on the long-term consequences related to adolescent ethanol exposure, with a special emphasis on the behavioral alterations and changes to ethanol sensitivity that can foster high levels of drinking in adulthood.",

Quiza cualquiera puede volverse adicto si es capaz de beber lo suficiente durante un periodo largo. Debido a que el adolescente, cuya vida se desenvuelve en medio de profundos cambios bio-psicosociales, suele explorar y experimentar, y a veces se vera involucrado en conductas de alto riesgo. La interrelacion entre las conductas de alto riesgo es dramatica; por ejemplo, ha sido bien establecido que hay una relacion entre los accidentes de transito y el uso de alcohol; la contribucion del alcohol a la mortalidad general no se limita al transito automotor, sino que abarca un porcentaje sustancial de muertos por incendios y ahogados. Asimismo, hay una clara correlacion entre fumar y el uso de alcohol y marihuana y la iniciacion precoz de relaciones sexuales. Desde el punto de vista clinico, es importante diferenciar el uso ocasional o experimental, de su consumo habitual o sostenido. Es esta ultima situacion la que debe preocupar al equipo interdisciplinario, especialmente si se acompana de disminucion en el rendimiento escolar o de problemas de relaciones interpersonales de comienzo reciente. La busqueda de causas desencadenantes debe incluir la exploracion del ambiente familiar (un numero importante de Direccion para correspondencia: Dr. Antonio Salas Riczker, Catedra de Farmacologia, Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Iquique y Sodiro s/n, Telf. 2528690, 2528810, Quito, Ecuador. casos se relaciona con dificultades del adolescente o el joven con sus padres, de los progenitores entre si o de alguna crisis familiar cronica); en un numero menor, pero siempre significativo, es posible detectar sicopatologia individual, como desordenes afectivos o cuadros sicoticos.

Despite the fact that the Spice products typically are labeled as incense and \"not for human consumption\", the reality is they are marketed to persons who intend to consume (usually smoke) the Spice for its psychoactive (principally marijuana-like) effects. Reports by consumers are highly variable with most claiming experiences resembling those caused by marijuana use; however, because many of the added drugs are unknown, they are not detected by standard drug screens.

It is not uncommon for adolescents to experiment with different substances such as alcohol or cigarettes, but this can lead to heavy and continued use, which is dangerous and may put their health at risk. Additionally, individuals who drink and smoke are more likely to participate in other risky behaviors, including using other drugs or driving after drinking. Adolescents may turn to substance use when they are under stress at home or at school, or when their friends are smoking or drinking. TOBACCO USE Tobacco can be used in the form of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or smokeless tobacco. Using tobacco at a young age increases the risk of addiction and later health problems. E About one-quarter of high school students reported having smoked a cigarette before the age of 13, and more than one-third of high school students reported smoking cigarettes in the past 30 days. 1 E Tobacco use has been associated with many health problems, including heart disease and cancer, 2 and is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. 3",

Marijuana is an illicit drug that is becoming commonly used among youths and young adults and is detrimental to the human health. This review addresses the questions that most people have about the use and the effects of marijuana on the human health. The review focuses on the effects and its seriousness, affecting physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral changes to the human existence. Most of the findings in this review were based upon studies done recently in the United States of America. This review shows that that the most commonly used illicit drug (marijuana) contains an active chemical called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which causes the mind-altering effects. When marijuana is smoked, its active ingredient, THC, travels throughout the body, including the brain, to produce its many effects. THC attaches to sites called cannabinoid receptors on nerve cells in the brain, affecting the way those cells function. The questions addressed include: \"Is there treatments for marijuana abusers?\"; and \"Can marijuana be used as some forms of medication to human?\".",

However, it is important to note that problem drinking rarely occurs in isolation from abuse of other drugs. For people dependent upon alcohol, tobacco is one of the mostly commonly coabused substances. Recent research suggests that individuals with alcohol dependency may gravitate toward tobacco use, in part, because of the positive effects of nicotine on aspects of cognitive performance that may be compromised as a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse. In this article, the author focuses on the effects of nicotine on behavioral and electrophysiological indexes of cognitive performance, and the impact of these effects on alcohol-related cognitive decrements. The author discusses implications of these findings in the context of treatment and recovery of people with alcoholism. Keywords: alcoholismcognitiontobacco use",

The type of cocaine used and the method of use often determine the kind of problems that occur. Patients may be reluctant or unable to offer information about their drug use during evaluation, so awareness of the medical consequences of cocaine use and a high index of suspicion are essential.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The cultivation of cannabis for its use and abuse has a long history. In recent years, the discovery of receptor sites and endogenous cannabinoids has greatly increased our knowledge of the pharmacology of the drug and reinvigorated the search for medical applications. Modern instrumental techniques enable cannabinoids to be determined in biological specimens at significant concentrations. Maximum concentrations of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in blood are achieved within minutes of commencement of smoking but take 1‐5 h after oral ingestion. Excretion of cannabis metabolites may take up to 12 days after low‐to‐moderate use but up to 77 days after very heavy use. Cannabis abuse adversely affects many behavioral and physiological functions. Legislative efforts have failed to control the increase in cannabis abuse. Oral fluid has emerged as a useful sample for assessing recent cannabis use and may be particularly useful for the roadside testing of drivers.",

      "abstract": "El uso de Cannabis como sustancia de abuso ha estado presente a lo largo de la historia de la humanidad. Actualmente es la droga ilegal mas utilizada a nivel mundial, especialmente en grupos de adolescentes y jovenes en quienes se ha encontrado una asociacion consistente entre su consumo y diferentes trastornos psicologicos y padecimientos como la depresion, ideacion suicida, trastorno de ansiedad, esquizofrenia, reduccion de habilidades cognitivas, entre otros. La tolerancia social al uso de la mariguana como droga esta asociado a la percepcion erronea que se tiene sobre ella, considerandola como poco peligrosa y por tanto, de bajo riesgo. Sin embargo hay evidencias cientificas de sus efectos daninos sobre la salud de los consumidores cronicos, entre quienes produce adiccion, tolerancia y sindrome de abstinencia. Por otro lado, se ha encontrado que algunos cannabinoides obtenidos de la mariguana como el dronabinol y la nabilona han demostrado tener efectos medicinales en el tratamiento de nauseas por quimioterapia, dolor por cancer y dolor neuropatico por esclerosis multiple, por lo que no se deben confundir los efectos de la mariguana como droga de los posibles efectos medicinales de algunos de sus compuestos. Ante la controversia que ha causado la posicion de algunos grupos a favor de su legalizacion y utilizacion “recreativa”, en este articulo se realiza una revision de aspectos historicos, cientificos y farmacologicos fundamentales relacionados con la mariguana, que permitiran al lector entender ?por que tanta controversia?",

Some people use cannabis regularly without signs of dependence; others show dependence despite using less. This study examined alcohol consumption as a moderator of this association. A sample of 476 people (primarily Caucasian men) who used cannabis at least once per week reported their alcohol consumption, cannabis use, and cannabis dependence symptoms in an Internet survey. Regressions revealed significant interactions between measures of cannabis use and alcohol consumption when predicting cannabis dependence. Cannabis use covaried with cannabis dependence, particularly in people who consumed alcohol frequently or in large amounts per week. Despite limitations, these data suggest that alcohol may decrease the safety of cannabis consumption.",

Medications can cause side effects that worsen quality of life or create other symptoms, and polypharmacy itself can be detrimental in older adults. Cannabinoids may offer a way of managing selected symptoms with fewer side effects. Medical marijuana is an important area of study for older adults because of the side effects of other medications. It is also important for Baby Boomers, who are likely to have more experience with marijuana than older adults of previous generations. Therefore, geriatricians should understand medical marijuana's clinical indications, adverse effects, and legal context.

      "title": "Adolescent caries: a discussion on diet and other factors, including soft drink consumption.",
      "abstract": "It can be summarized that adolescents have unique needs and concerns in regards to dental care. Among these concerns is the adolescent diet, which often contains high amounts of high-carbohydrate snack foods. Popular among these foods are carbonated beverages, usually containing significant amounts of sugar and caffeine. Sugar is a concern, as increased consumption of sugars has been identified as a potential factor in an increase in caries activity. Caffeine is a factor, as regular ingestion of caffeine has been shown to potentially lead to a physical desire to habitually ingest caffeine. Thus, there are increases in both the amount of sugars, as well as the amount of time that these sugars are present in the oral environment. Perhaps more significantly, the presence of caffeine in soft drinks makes it less likely that preventive counseling with an adolescent, related to the importance of a decrease in consumption, will be successful. In essence, teenagers like to drink \"pop,\" and they don't want to stop. Furthermore, because caffeine consumption is considered socially acceptable and is ingrained into daily habits, parents are likely to be regular consumers of coffee, carbonated beverages, or other caffeine-containing products. This makes preventive counseling on these matters more challenging. Dentists, dental hygienists, and related health professionals should be aware of the unique aspects of treating adolescents, and be willing and able to spend time on prevention and diet counseling. Preventive measures such as prescription-strength fluoride gels for home use, fluoride varnishes, and others may need additional emphasis on individuals exhibiting increased caries susceptibility.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a period of life that makes people vulnerable and prone to illegal substances. They are more likely to commit offenses than any other age group. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of cannabis by adolescents worldwide. Cannabis has now been described in several countries, including Greece, as the dominant illegal substance and has been more closely linked to youth culture, as the age of starting cannabis is usually younger than for other drugs. Cannabis has very low acute toxicity and a very small mortality rate compared to other drugs, but morbidity is the most important impact on public health. In many countries, medical cannabis is considered legal in certain specific quantities, but the laws vary from country to country. The use of cannabis is examined and studied on many levels mainly because it affects teenagers in many areas including cognitive, social, and psycho-emotional. Some studies around the world confirm that the earlier and more prolonged exposure to cannabis use, the greater the damage. The fact that it can lead to adverse conditions in adolescents makes it imperative to proceed to primary prevention in the school environment but also in the society of each country. This will properly shape the adolescent's perception of cannabis and help identify other problems that occupy everyday life of adolescents preventing them from starting cannabis use or stop them from continuing using it.",

      "abstract": "As bebidas energéticas são compostos gaseificados que contêm em sua composição cafeína e taurina, estimulantes que, combinados, aumentam a excitabilidade neuronal, a pressão arterial e a atividade do sistema nervoso central, aumentando a concentração e agitação e diminuindo a sensação de cansaço. O consumo em grandes quantidades e em longo prazo pode gerar efeitos adversos, como arritmias, palpitações, taquicardia, dispnéia, insônia e ansiedade. Outros estimulantes presentes nos energéticos, como guaraná e L-carnitina, potencializam os efeitos da cafeína e podem provocar sobrecarga no organismo, especialmente quando consumidos em excesso. Tais efeitos são ainda maximizados se o uso do energético for combinado ao álcool, sendo mais prejudicial à saúde do que a utilização apenas do álcool. Isso ocorre porque a cafeína mascara os efeitos sedativos do álcool, levando à ingestão de maiores quantidades do mesmo. O início precoce do consumo do energético também pode induzir à dependência do álcool pelo jovem. O consumo desenfreado de bebidas energéticas pelos jovens já se configura como um problema de saúde pública no Brasil e em muitos países. Também há uma preocupação crescente quanto ao fato de que o marketing desses produtos é frequentemente direcionado ao público jovem, utilizando-se uma linguagem descontraída e os associando a esportes e festas, o que contribui para a normalização desse consumo ainda na adolescência. Devido a isso, tais bebidas necessitam ser devidamente regulamentadas, quanto ao marketing, formulação padronizada e rotulagem, além da necessidade de campanhas educativas direcionadas ao público jovem quanto aos riscos de consumo, principalmente associado à bebida alcoólica.",

      "title": "The Case for Cannabis",
      "abstract": "FigureFigureCannabis is seeing a huge financial boom because of recreational Cannabis legalization across the United States, Canada, and other countries. But in its wake, medical Cannabis (formerly known as marijuana) is being left in the shadows. Why would an industry that has been built on its medical benefits and that advertises them routinely suddenly forget the shoulders of the giants it stands on? Simple: Money. Most people I meet in the recreational industry started for a noble cause: Cannabis helped them with skin cancer, get off opioids after a motorcycle accident, deal with anxiety, etc. Yet none of these individuals took the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. None of them cares what happens to your mom, dad, spouse, friend, kid, or loved one simply because Cannabis won't kill you. Is everything else fair game? There are no real limits on usage, purchase, or dosage; you can get 90% THC in a single vape oil, dab, or shatter v. the three to seven percent THC flower you could get in the 1970s. The recreational limits in place in California are laughable. \"Research\" is done by leaders in the field on products that would make any \"Cannabis connoisseur\" (AKA lifetime user) in a recreationally legal state scoff at the dosage used in research. This is akin to doing research on Tylenol with codeine while hydromorphone is being sold in the marketplace and then making claims that Tylenol with codeine research is applicable to hydromorphone. That being said, there is still more ongoing research on Cannabis than on widely sold products such as Ambien and Lunesta. But let's not stop there. A physician's recommendation in California now doesn't mean a thing (except in pediatric cases where it is imperative). Patients are taxed at the same rate as a recreational user, which harms our most vulnerable patients: those with chronic illness, including the elderly, children, and disabled patients, placing an additional financial burden on them month after month to get their medication. Insurance doesn't cover these medications either, except in extreme cases like Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Patients get no protection under the law, including employee and driving protections. Please note that benzodiazepines, hypnosedatives, and opioids when taken appropriately on a doctor's recommendation are protected, but in this instance, a patient who is not intoxicated and using medication appropriately is not protected under the law. The only thing a physician can currently provide a patient is actual medical advice. And physicians using \"marijuana\" as medicine risk losing their medical license. (Vice. Oct. 16, 2018; https://bit.ly/3yznlxT.) We physicians aren't even very good at protecting ourselves. Think it's a great way to make some side income? It is, but if you live in certain states (like California), you cannot even hint at profiting or investing in a Cannabis company if you recommend Cannabis because you can lose your license. On the other hand, if you don't write recommendations for Cannabis, feel free to invest in a pot farm, like one of our California Medical Board Representatives! The Art of Medicine Emergency physicians have an amazing foundation for understanding patients, understand a huge variety of medical pathologies, and have the capacity to see the bigger picture, which includes speaking with the families of patients who die in the ED (young and old, expected and unexpected), manually disimpacting an opioid-induced constipation patient and hearing them scream from pain and embarrassment (all while discussing opioid reduction strategies and improved bowel habits), and hearing about the anxiety of a parent who has a child with chronic seizures in the ED for an abnormally long seizure, etc. The focus of medicine now is not just on diagnosis and treatment, but also the social and behavioral sciences that we started learning about in medical school and that should be a part of all medical practices. Patients are happy to Google on their own to identify and read up on a diagnosis or medication, but that's not what they need us for anymore. They need us to orchestrate their care and anticipate their questions. Consider a patient with a UTI. Here is a quick script that embodies the art of medicine: \"Ms. X, you have a UTI. Feel free to Google it. Here is an antibiotic that should make it better quickly, and this is an additional prescription for the pain (or burning or urgency) that you may experience; use it if you need it. Some patients don't like that it can stain their underwear due to the color it makes your urine, so use a panty liner to prevent staining. You may develop a yeast infection from using the antibiotic. Has that ever happened to you before? Yes? Here is a vaginal suppository prescription, so that your next week or two doesn't have to be consumed with doctor's appointments, fear, vaginal irritation, and frustration for a normal anticipated side effect. Probiotics should be considered anytime you are taking an antibiotic to help prevent other antibiotic side effects. Also, I don't mean to be intrusive, but consider using vaginal lubricant when you engage in sexual activity to help prevent further UTIs.\" That advice to a patient is simple, quick, and effective, and it prevents follow-up visits to the doctor's office and normalizes the experience for your patient. There should be four prescriptions on your EMR note standard for a UTI. None of this is available on Google. And that's what Cannabis medicine is. It is not just \"take a toke, and call me if you still aren't stoned.\" It is assessing the totality of a patient's medical experience. Take, for instance, a 14-year-old boy I treated in my Cannabis practice, who has been living with a seizure disorder his entire life. He was taking an antiseizure medication as well as three or four other prescription medications for depression, sleep, and ADHD, and he still experienced breakthrough seizures, one of which landed him in the ED with his mother. The mother told me the EP berated her about her son not taking his seizure medications (which was not true; the child is under the care of a neurologist and on antiepileptic medication). Because of the breakthrough seizure, the EP and neurologist added a medication, but it caused the child to be hyperaggressive, angry, and violent, and the mother stopped this medication. All of these aspects are evaluated in Cannabis medicine. Antiseizure medications with unwanted side effects would be slowly titrated off (with approval from the neurologist) and CBD slowly added. The result was this patient's aggression improved after the offending pharmaceutical was removed and CBD was started, and there was improvement in his family relationships, his caretaker's mental health, seizures, and sleep. Oil tincture was administered by a parent using BID-TID dosing and adjusted based on the results of treatment, yielding whole patient care and a positive ripple effect for the whole family. EPs talking about mental health is something we should all be doing more, not compartmentalizing that into something that doesn't affect us. This mother's comment at the end of our last visit was perhaps the most impactful: \"We have a different life, a better life. My son is able to complete 51 tasks instead of three. School is happy with his progress, and so are we. He has a life of enjoyment now, instead of being a zombie. This is the first time in 13 years that a doctor has helped change our quality of life.\" Every person reading this article can provide this care to patients. If you do not feel you can do this directly, then refer to a Cannabis physician who can.",

It improves performance and endurance during prolonged, exhaustive exercise. To a lesser degree it also enhances short-term, high-intensity athletic performance. Caffeine improves concentration, reduces fatigue, and enhances alertness. Habitual intake does not diminish caffeine's ergogenic properties. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physiologic effects of caffeine, but adenosine receptor antagonism most likely accounts for the primary mode of action. It is relatively safe and has no known negative performance effects, nor does it cause significant dehydration or electrolyte imbalance during exercise. Routine caffeine consumption may cause tolerance or dependence, and abrupt discontinuation produces irritability, mood shifts, headache, drowsiness, or fatigue. Major sport governing bodies ban excessive use of caffeine, but current monitoring techniques are inadequate, and ethical dilemmas persist regarding caffeine intake by athletes.",

We describe the case of a patient with weekend alcohol abuse that was followed by cocaine use and sex. After being treated with nalmefene, the patient decreased alcohol consumption and did not engage cocaine use and sex. The patient is a 36-year-old man with a previous history of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol abuse. After detoxification the patient became a weekend drinker. Two months later he started complaining that after drinking he needed to consume cocaine and this led him to having sex with prostitutes. These behaviours had a serious impact on his finances that lead him to asking for help. Nalmefene, 18 mg at dinner before going out, was prescribed. Taking one pill of nalmefene “allowed me to drink several shots without feeling a need to continue drinking and, most importantly, I didn’t feel the need to consume cocaine and have sex”. In an attempt to ascertain if what had happened the previous weekend was “psychological” the patient went out without taking nalmefene. The pattern of alcohol use, control loss, and consumption of cocaine and sex repeated itself. During the following two months, the patient took nalmefene during dinner before going out every weekend and the results were the same as when he first took the treatment. Conclusion Nalmefene may be helpful in the treatment of several other addictions by blocking the positive reinforcements of the drugs.

      "abstract": "Nursing lifestyle approaches and principles can improve the well-being for persons who use substances. Substance use in our society is common and can have a direct impact on one's physical and mental health. Substance misuse has been identified as a leading cause of chronic medical and mental health conditions. The etiology of substance use is complex. It occurs on a spectrum from abstinence to severe and disordered use. Comprehensive treatment is needed to address the multilayered biopsychosocial issues that hinder recovery from substance use problems. This chapter will discuss lifestyle medicine-based strategies for improving the well-being of individuals who use substances, including motivational interviewing, harm reduction interventions, counseling, diet, and exercise therapies. Motivational interviewing is an effective technique to help an individual move through stages of change toward abstinence. Harm reduction interventions seek to reduce risk associated with substance use and may be useful for individuals as they work toward abstinence. Diet, exercise, group or individual therapies, and other nonpharmacologic modalities can be effective in addressing substance use and its multilayered etiologies.",

All things being equal otherwise, the weight and adiposity of smokers are lower than those of non-smokers. The calorie intake of smokers is equal to that of non-smokers, but the nicotine absorbed with each cigarette smoked temporarily increases the basal metabolism and in particular the energy expended in all physical activities. The lack of compensatory increase of food intake in response to the increase of energy expenditure explains why smokers are underweight. Food consumption might be reduced by an increase of circulating fatty acids and by a nicotine-induced inhibition of insulin secretion. The weight increase observed after tobacco withdrawal is caused by the normalization of expenditures and by release of the brake on food consumption. Weight increase is usually important in heavy smokers, women and subjects with low physical activity. Fifty per cent of smokers who have given up smoking put on less than 3 kg. The effort required to mitigate this disadvantage is modest and it can be delayed and separated from the acute weaning period with a medicinal treatment.",

Shakes, vomiting, feelings of anxiety and panic, fear of delirium tremens (D.T's) and withdrawal seizures (fits) will drive the drinker back to alcohol. To overcome or to postpone the withdrawal he/she continues drinking, gets sicker and life gets worse. Another attempt to stop drinking follows, with the same result : back to the bottle.",

      "abstract": "Research shows that problem behaviors manifested early tend to persist into later life. Problem drinking does not necessarily commit the young adolescent to a life course of this behavior, but it does alter the probabilities. Conversely, early abstinence is a strong predictor of later healthful behavior. An important observation is that alcohol and other drug use tends to decrease along with smoking decreases. Young adolescents tend to believe that most of their peers engage in a particular type of behavior whether that is the actual case or not. There is a tendency across populations of adolescents to overestimate such behaviors by a factor of six or eight. In one study, school children estimated that about two-thirds of their peers smoked while the actual figure was about one-tenth. Adolescents tend to have weak orientation to the future, especially in regard to consequences of risk-taking behavior. College-bound adolescents tend to have a longer view of the future than those who do not pursue college, but in general adolescents think, \"It can't happen to me,\" or, \"It's so far off that I just can't think about it.\" They are focused on the here and now. Many youngsters when they think about it have a dismal view of the future. They are doubtful about their own ability to influence events in ways that build toward a rewarding life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "The adolescent marijuana literature is reviewed. Studies show that the prevalence of marijuana use is generally quite low in elementary schools. In junior and senior high samples, findings vary greatly from place to place. The prevalence of use increased dramatically during the 1970s although the use patterns may have peaked already in some areas. The use of marijuana increases with age, but some evidence suggests that a slight drop-off in use occurs near the end of high school. Female use seems to be increasing more than male use. Use seems to be somewhat more prevalent in middle- and upper-middle-class homes and in broken homes. Mixed support has been found for the hypothesis that marijuana users have parents that are more permissive. Parents of marijuana users are generally characterized as being less warm and supportive, and more inclined toward the use of drugs themselves. Peer and sibling use of marijuana seem to be particularly important predictors of adolescent marijuana use. Findings on personality characteristics of marijuana users are not extensive and are somewhat contradictory. There is some evidence that users tend to be somewhat alienated, external in their locus of control, and possibly higher on anxiety. Users are also characterized by a higher value on independence vs achievement and more positive attitudes toward marijuana use. Behavioral correlates of marijuana use include greater use of alcohol and other drugs, and poorer school performance.",

      "title": "Alcohol, still the forgotten drug",
      "abstract": "I was interested to read the paper by Staiger and colleagues 1. Although we persist in referring to drug and alcohol problems by reference to single substances, this can be misleading. It is now more than 10 years since I wrote an editorial in this journal about something that has long been known by all who work with people with substance use disorders: ‘Few drug takers confine themselves to using a single substance. Cigarettes and alcohol often go together. Heroin users may also take drugs such as cocaine and benzodiazepines, and heavy drinkers often also use illicit drugs. Virtually all heroin addicts are also cigarette smokers’ 2. The point of my editorial was that although the reality of multiple substance use is well known, it is seldom given the attention that it deserves. The reasons for this are many. Not the least of these is that matters become complicated when multiple substances are considered. For instance, if someone regularly uses two (or more) drugs, do they have one or two (or more) drug problems? If they are dependent upon two (or more drugs), do they have a more severe dependence problem than if they took only one drug? Is severity of dependence upon each drug additive? Or interactive? Or synergistic? ‘Our favourite drug’, alcohol, is widely used and widely misused. Within the extended menu of substances used by drug takers, alcohol has a special place and deserves greater attention than it generally receives. Staiger et al. draw our attention back to the misuse of alcohol by drug addicts and to the dearth of studies about how alcohol misuse may interact with other drug problems. Heavy drinking among patients in methadone programmes has been recognized as a problem since such programmes were established 3. Heavy drinking among drug misusers is also associated with serious health risks. Hepatitis C infection is common among injection drug users (IDUs), and infected people who drink heavily are at greatly increased risk of serious liver disease. Drug overdose is one of the most frequent causes of death among drug misusers, and heavy drinking among opiate misusers greatly increases the risk of overdose: many so-called heroin overdoses should be attributed more accurately to the combined use of alcohol with opiates 4. Heavy drinking was relatively common among dependent heroin users in the National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS): approximately a quarter were drinking heavily at treatment intake, and the same proportion continued to drink heavily throughout the 5-year follow-up 5. Although some problematic drinkers reduced their frequency and quantity of drinking, many made little change in their drinking behaviour; even with the reductions in quantity of alcohol among the problematic drinkers, typical daily amounts of alcohol at follow-up were between 10 and 19 units (approximately half a bottle of spirits) 6. The interrelationship between drinking and drug use remains poorly understood. Staiger et al. report several studies showing that alcohol use increases relapse to drug use. Our own research suggested that changes in heroin use and drinking outcomes may be largely independent, although heroin misusers who had poor drinking outcomes were more likely to also be using cocaine, amphetamines and benzodiazepines 6. One interesting but little-discussed aspect of the substance use behaviours of drug addicts is that although many are heavy drinkers, a relatively high proportion are abstinent from alcohol. More than a third of the NTORS sample had not used alcohol at all during the 3 months before treatment, and the proportion who were alcohol-abstainers remained constant throughout the 5-year study 5. This abstinence rate is much higher than for the general population. It is not only the drinking behaviour of heroin addicts that is neglected. There is surprisingly little interest in the broader issue of multiple substance misuse. Although there are problems with a substance-specific approach to drug use disorders, it is important to remember that different drugs have different attractions for different users. For example, the relatively high rates of alcohol abstinence among heroin addicts may not be found among other groups of drug misusers. A common pattern of multiple substance misuse involves the concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol. The combined use of alcohol and cocaine produces increased and prolonged euphoria compared to either substance on its own 7, and for some cocaine users the concurrent use of alcohol is an integral part of their pattern of drug-taking. This effect may also be influenced by the type of cocaine being used. Cocaine powder users report more frequent heavy drinking than crack users, and whereas cocaine powder users tended to use cocaine and alcohol concurrently, crack users tended to use alcohol at the end of crack-using sessions 8, 9. Drug users with concurrent polydrug use problems may require special consideration and treatment planning. Alcohol use and, in particular, excessive drinking, is often neglected in the treatment of drug users. Drug users and clinical staff may focus either deliberately or unintentionally upon what is perceived to be the main illicit problem drug and under-rate the use of other substances. The extent and severity of heavy drinking among drug misusers points to the need to develop programmes and interventions that are designed specifically to tackle alcohol-related problems in this client group.

      "title": "Decentering alcohol: Non‐drug pleasure and reinforcement as an alternative target",
      "abstract": "Though pleasure from alcohol is oft underemphasized, we suggest that public health messaging only needs to acknowledge (rather than emphasize) the pleasures of alcohol, to broadly accept the human propensity for pleasure, and to intentionally leverage these empirical findings by emphasizing and increasing the availability of non-drug alternatives. The opinion and debate piece by Nicholls and Hunt [1] stimulates an interesting discussion on the importance of pleasure in public health-oriented research on alcohol. We agree that pleasure is an important concept in understanding alcohol use as well as other substance use, and that public health discourse limits its own efficacy by focusing primarily on harm without acknowledging many of the benefits people report experiencing from drinking (or other drug use). This idea is broadly consistent with the behavioral science literature, which posits that alcohol can function as a positive reinforcer by producing desirable effects (e.g. enhancing social connection, inducing pleasant subjective effects) that increase the likelihood of future alcohol use. These reinforcing effects may, at least during any discrete use occasion, outweigh the costs, acute or chronic, of alcohol use [2]. Although humans are motivated by costly immediate harms [3], they are less so by delayed, diffuse, and uncertain ones [4-6]. This human aversion to immediate harms is matched by an innate, evolutionarily adaptive drive for pleasure or related positive subjective states. From a population perspective, harms associated with alcohol use are characteristically delayed, diffuse and uncertain for most people who use alcohol, if they experience problems at all, and rewards are often immediate and robust. In the case of social connection, for example, alcohol may help to facilitate a basic human need of social bonding [7, 8] while only inconsistently resulting in harms that lessen this potent reward. Ignoring the reality that many find alcohol to be pleasurable goes against the experience of many who drink and threatens to delegitimize public health messaging. A similar problem can be found in many treatment settings that focus almost exclusively on reiterating harms of alcohol while failing to acknowledge that drinking once served an adaptive function, even if for most it was maladaptive by the time treatment began. Although perhaps conspicuously absent from public health messaging research, there is a rich history of experimental work describing the pleasurable effects of alcohol and other drugs [9-12]. These studies, typically conducted in the framework described by the United States Food and Drug Administration Human Abuse Potential guidelines, seek to evaluate subjective effects like 'Good Effect' or 'Drug Liking' and determine the potential for a drug's future misuse [13]. Notably, these studies highlight the role that pleasure, or more broadly positive reinforcing effects, play in determining future behavior—behaviors that evoke greater pleasure are more likely to be repeated in the future, and a drug's 'abuse potential' is at least in part related to its ability to induce pleasure. In addition to understanding the importance of the reinforcing efficacy of alcohol, modern behavioral models of addiction have emphasized the importance of alternative, non-drug reinforcement that can effectively compete with substances [14, 15]. Research across the translational spectrum has demonstrated that behavioral allocation toward substance reinforcers is dependent upon the presence or absence of other reinforcers in the choice context [16-19]. Typically, addiction treatment focuses on explicit reduction in the value of a drug through pharmacological or behavioral methods. Interventions may instead (or may also) increase the value of non-drug alternatives that serve the same functional purpose that drugs do for a given patient. This idea is highlighted in the recent sober curious movement and the proliferation of non-alcoholic beverages (e.g. mocktails). Such approaches offer a mechanism of reducing alcohol use by introducing an alternative that, at least partly, retains many of the pleasurable functions of alcohol (e.g. social connection and acceptance, taste) and effectively serves as a competing option. Public health serves a societal function and, as stated by the authors, is built on a foundational principle that long-term rewards, such as health, are better than short-term rewards. By necessity, public health typically takes a utilitarian, rather than Kantian, approach, valuing the whole over the individual, and focuses on the health of the public in addition to those pleasures that can be paired with health. However, we agree with the authors that public health risks its legitimacy by ignoring the experience of people who primarily experience the positive, rather than the negative, effects of alcohol. Perhaps a compromise: public health messaging only needs to acknowledge (rather than emphasize) the pleasures of alcohol, to broadly accept the human propensity for pleasure, and to intentionally leverage these empirical findings by emphasizing and increasing the availability of non-drug alternatives. Public health messages that can craft a compelling and competitive narrative of pleasure in other activities may be more effective than focusing exclusively on the pleasures or perils of alcohol alone.

In San Francisco, this has been accompanied by drastic changes in price and availability and the novel phenomenon of fentanyl smoking. Ethnographic research among people smoking fentanyl in San Francisco, often living houseless, suggests a process of knowledge reconstruction with the adaptation and discovery of consumption techniques. Equipment and techniques borrowed from more established cannabis consumption, some elaborate, are often used. An emerging appreciation of taste and the smoking process, rather than the achievement of intoxication alone, is transforming the potential for pleasure and connoisseurship among some of the city's most marginalized and stigmatized inhabitants. Given these signs of a new interest in fentanyl's taste and the smoking experience, there may be potential to encourage more deliberative, slow consumption to reduce the likelihood of overdose among those at risk.",

The conventional interpretation of this phenomenon is that nicotine is a psychoactive drug that induces tolerance, and the abrupt cessation of tobacco use often precipitates a withdrawal syndrome. 4,5 As in alcohol or narcotic withdrawal, the newly abstinent person may feel ill and experience a temporary decrement in performance.

Although higher AS use rates are reported by elite and competitive athletes, a significant number of recreational athletes appear to be using AS. The scientific literature is inconsistent and at times at odds with the conventional wisdom and empirical experiences of the athletic community regarding the ergogenic effects of AS. However, individuals experienced in weight training, with an adequate diet, and who continue training during AS administration seem to consistently increase their strength and lean mass over what would have been expected from training alone. Previous research documenting deleterious but transient and mostly asymptomatic acute changes in physiology, risk factors and behavior has been inconclusive regarding the long term health impact. The abuse of AS constitutes a special challenge to society. AS are not euphorigenic or mood altering immediately following administration, as are other illicit drugs; the appetite for AS has been created predominantly by our societal fixations on winning and physical appearance. Consequently any successful intervention in this area must go beyond education, law enforcement and drug testing, and attempt to change a social environment which currently encourages the use of AS.",

      "title": "Nicotine as an Addictive Substance: A Critical Examination of the Basic Concepts and Empirical Evidence",
      "abstract": "The present review is a critical analysis of the concepts behind and the empirical data supporting the view that tobacco use represents an addiction to nicotine. It deals with general aspects of the notion of addiction, while concentrating on specific problems associated with incorporating nicotine into current frameworks. The notion of addiction suffers from unprecedented definitional difficulties. The definitions offered by various authorities are very different, even contradictory. Definitions that reasonably include nicotine are so broad and vague that they allow many trivial things, such as salt, sugar, and watching television, to be considered addictive. Definitions that exclude the trivia also exclude nicotine. The addiction hypothesis, in general, is strongly shaped by views that certain drugs bring about a molecular level subversion of rationality. The main human evidence for this is verbal reports of smokers who say that they can't quit. On the other hand, the existence of many millions of successful quitters suggests that most people can quit. Some smokers don't quit, but whether they can't is another matter. The addiction hypothesis would be greatly strengthened by the demonstration that any drug of abuse produces special changes in the brain. It has yet to be shown that any drug produces changes in the brain different from those produced by many innocuous substances and events. The effects of nicotine on the brain are similar to those of sugar, salt, exercise, and other harmless substances and events. Apart from numerous conceptual and definitional inadequacies with the addiction concept in general, the notion that nicotine is addictive lacks reasonable empirical support. Nicotine does not have the properties of reference drugs of abuse. There are so many findings that conflict so starkly with the view that nicotine is addictive that it increasingly appears that adhering to the nicotine addiction thesis is only defensible on extra-scientific grounds.",

      "title": "[Tobacco control experience in the debate on marijuana legalisation].",
      "abstract": "LEGALIZZAZIONE DI MARIJUANA E TABACCO Il divieto di vendita della marijuana ha molte conseguenze negative, come la detenzione di giovani per possesso di quantita medie di marijuana e lo sviluppo del mercato illegale che a sua volta genera crimine, violenza e corruzione. Se la vendita venisse legalizzata, la tassazione della marijuana produrrebbe entrate per lo stato e potrebbe essere utilizzata senza problemi a scopo terapeutico. La marijuana, infatti, ha importanti effetti terapeutici: riduce nausea e vomito durante i trattamenti oncologici, riduce la perdita di appetito nella sindrome da deperimento nell’AIDS, ha effetti analgesici (trattamento del dolore cronico neuropatico) e antispasmodici (sclerosi multipla).1 Sicuramente il fumo di marijuana e meno mortale del fumo di tabacco e determina una dipendenza piu bassa. Infatti, solo il 9% di utilizzatori di cannabis rispondono ai criteri di dipendenza riportati nel Manuale diagnostico e statistico dei disturbi mentali (DSM-5), rispetto al 32% dei fumatori di tabacco.2 Ci sono, comunque, importanti effetti sulla salute. Coloro che dall’adolescenza fumano marijuana per ≥4 giorni la settimana perdono 8 punti nel quoziente intellettivo nell’arco di 25 anni, tra i 13 e i 38 anni.3 L’uso regolare nell’adolescenza e associato ad abbandono e basso rendimento scolastico. In coloro che ne fanno uso da molti anni sono documentati deficit di attenzione, memoria e apprendimento verbale. L’uso regolare, inoltre, e associato a sintomi psicotici ed e considerato un fattore di rischio per l’insorgenza di schizofrenia.1 Inoltre, i fumatori di marijuana possono avere molti sintomi della bronchite cronica dei fumatori di tabacco. Nel piu recente studio di coorte su circa 50.000 svedesi seguiti per 40 anni, i forti consumatori di marijuana (>50 volte nella loro vita) hanno un rischio piu che doppio di sviluppare tumore del polmone, anche dopo aver aggiustato per fumo di tabacco, condizione socioeconomica, uso di alcol e condizioni respiratorie.4 Negli altri studi sul tumore del polmone, i risultati sono inconsistenti per brevita del follow-up, bassa numerosita, uso di marijuana non indagato approfonditamente. Per altre sedi tumorali i risultati sono insufficienti per una valutazione adeguata dell’impatto della marijuana sul rischio cancerogeno.5 D’altronde anche il tabacco non e stato tanto letale e capace di determinare dipendenza come lo e oggi.6 Nel 1880 pochi usavano il tabacco, in particolare le sigarette, e le morti attribuibili a tabacco erano poche. Negli anni Cinquanta-Settanta del secolo scorso oltre il 50% degli uomini italiani fumavano sigarette e, qualche decennio dopo, il tumore del polmone e diventato una delle cause piu frequenti di morte negli uomini e, recentemente, anche nelle donne. Questa trasformazione del tabacco da prodotto di nicchia a prodotto di massa e avvenuta attraverso innovazioni effettuate dall’industria del tabacco. Nel tempo l’industria ha sviluppato sigarette meno irritanti tramite la sostituzione del tabacco burley con quello virginia (sigarette bionde), tramite lo sviluppo di nuovi procedimenti di cura e l’introduzione del filtro. Come effetto di questi cambiamenti, i fumatori hanno iniziato a inalare piu profondamente, facilitando cosi l’assorbimento polmonare per velocizzare l’arrivo della nicotina al cervello. Questi ben documentati procedimenti di ingegnerizzazione della sigaretta hanno determinato un aumento del potenziale di dipendenza del tabacco e un aumento dell’assorbimento di tossine e cancerogeni. Oltretutto, l’industria ha aggiunto sostanze per migliorare il sapore e velocizzare ulteriormente l’assorbimento, senza tener conto degli effetti sulla salute che tali additivi hanno.6 Secondo alcuni esperti di tobacco control,7-9 nel dibattito sulla legalizzazione non e stato ancora considerato il potenziale effetto dell’entrata delle multinazionali del tabacco (o di altre societa, come le industrie alimentari e delle bevande) nel mondo della marijuana legalizzata, con il loro potere di marketing e la capacita di progettare sigarette di marijuana per massimizzare il rilascio di tetraidrocannabinolo (THC), allo stesso modo di come hanno fatto per le sigarette attuali di tabacco. Insomma, l’industria ha il potere di cambiare radicalmente ed espandere l’uso della marijuana.",

The physician's awareness of this risk helps in the prevention of dependence. Four variables play a part in the development of dependence, ie, dose, duration of treatment, the history, and the patient's personality. A dosage higher than the usual therapeutic dose not only is not needed in most patients but produces more side effects. Short term therapy carries a low risk of dependence and is preferred. It is advisable not to use benzodiazepines in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse, as dependent personalities pose a higher risk than other personality types.",

      "title": "Commitment Devices",
      "abstract": "Unhealthy behaviors are responsible for a high percentage of health care costs and poor health outcomes. In large companies, unhealthy behaviors by employees are considered an important challenge to affordable benefits coverage. Employers increasingly leverage incentives to encourage changes in employees’ health-related behaviors. In this viewpoint, the authors discuss the potential and the limitations of commitment devices, as distinct from incentives, to influence health behaviors. Many people intend to improve their health behaviors in the future, but when the future arrives, they fail to follow through. Many will precommit their “future selves” to follow-through by purchasing gym memberships or scheduling workouts with friends; persons with alcoholism take disulfiram in the morning so drinking alcohol in the evening will make them ill. The commitment devices increase the probability of individuals’ compliance with voluntarily imposed restrictions until they have accomplished their goals or their voluntarily imposed penalties for not reaching their goals. A common form of commitment device, also called a deposit or commitment contract, involves people voluntarily depositing money into accounts they can access again only if they accomplish a goal. These devices can help people lose weight, improve their diets, exercise more, and quit smoking. Such commitment devices have 2 basic features: people voluntarily use them and the devices link consequences to an individual’s failure to achieve preset goals. Commitment devices can be associated with various consequences. Immutable consequences cannot be reversed by future choices. They can have monetary aspects in which people risk losing their own money if, by a predetermined date, an independent assessor reports that they did not reach their goals. Commitment devices involving mutable consequences constrain future behaviors but allow people future latitude to mitigate the consequences. One form is temptation bundling or allowing people to restrict their access to instantly gratifying experiences only to occasions in which they engage in goal-consistent behaviors. Commitment devices are powerful tools for changing health behaviors, but they are underused. Maximizing the population health benefits of commitment devices requires increasing the numbers of people who use them and increasing their effectiveness. Health professionals can educate patients about the gap between intention and action. Making enrollment and participation as simple as possible by eliminating unnecessary complexity could also facilitate greater use of commitment devices. To improve population health, such devices need to be more effective. Often, health-relevant goals require changing long-term behavior even after an initial objective has been achieved. Research should investigate whether and how commitment devices can be effective tools to assist with long-term behavior change. Commitment devices can provide positive feedback as soon as people begin using them. One promising direction for future research involves leveraging the influence of existing social networks. Commitment devices that involve these networks by creating social consequences for failing to achieve goals can be implemented inexpensively. Patients are more successful at achieving their health goals when they have access to commitment devices. Strategies for achieving higher rates of ongoing engagement and sustained behavior change are needed for the devices to have widespread influence and benefit.",

While the literature is replete with reports of mental disturbances following acute intoxications (1, 4, 7, 15), the mental health implications of long-term abuse of cannabis remain speculative (9, 13). Since the drug possesses psychotomimetic and hallucinogenic (8) properties, prolonged experimentation with cannabis on human subjects is undesirable. The clinical manifestations of disturbed mental functioning due to chronic abuse of cannabis can therefore be best observed in societies where the drug is taken as a pastime, generally to enjoy pleasant euphoria. Such a situation is found in India where the use of cannabis has become woven into the general philosophy of life over the years. The drug is particularly used at religious ceremonies, and sweets and non-alcoholic beverages containing varying quantities of cannabis are traditionally offered and consumed during the colour-throwing festival of Holi.",

      "title": "Marijuana",
      "abstract": "Marijuana (cannabis), the illicit drug used most frequently in the United States, may be smoked in cigarettes (joints, nails, reefers), pipes (bongs, bowls), or cigars (blunts); mixed with food; or brewed as a tea. Hashish (hash), a potent resin of cannabis, also may be used as a sticky black liquid (hash oil). Other street terms are pot, herb, weed, grass, widow, and ganja.The 2010 Monitoring the Future study, which assesses adolescent substance use patterns, revealed that admitted lifetime marijuana use among eighth, 10th, and 12th graders in the United States was 17.3%, 33.4%, and 43.8%, respectively; daily use was 1.2%, 3.3%, and 6.1%, respectively. Trends in use have varied in recent decades.The primary active chemical in marijuana is THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Increased cultivation of sinsemilla made from buds of female cannabis plants has raised mean THC content from 0.7% in the 1970s to 8.5% in 2008, with wide variability in dose. Street marijuana also may be contaminated with a variety of other drugs, toxins, and infectious agents.After smoking marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs to the bloodstream and brain, where it binds to cannabinoid receptors. Euphoria and other brain effects occur within seconds of smoking, peak in 15 to 30 minutes, and taper over 2 to 3 hours. The onset of action after oral ingestion is 30 to 90 minutes, with peak effect in 2 to 3 hours and a duration of 4 to 12 hours. THC is highly lipid-soluble and has a serum half-life of ∼19 hours.Physiologic effects include transient tachycardia for up to 3 hours, increased sitting blood pressure with abnormal orthostatic responses, and peripheral vasodilation. Regular marijuana smoking may cause respiratory effects similar to those caused by tobacco, including daily cough, more frequent lung infections, exacerbation of asthma, decreased pulmonary function, and increased risk of respiratory tract cancer. Marijuana smoke contains 50% to 70% more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke, and marijuana users typically inhale more deeply and longer, increasing carcinogen exposure. Cannabis may reduce immune function, and heavy use causes reversible decreases in sperm count and motility in animals. Irregular ovulation also has been noted. Short-term behavioral effects include memory and learning deficits, distorted sensory and time perception, problem-solving difficulties, and impaired coordination. Heavy marijuana use may exacerbate depression, anxiety, personality disorders, and sleep disturbance. There may be negative effects on intellectual, employment, and social skills. Memory impairment may last up to 1 month after last use. Students using marijuana have lower high school grades and graduation rates than do nonusing peers.Marijuana increases the risk of injury, unwanted and unprotected sex, and other drug use. Recreational doses impair driving as much as blood alcohol concentrations of 0.07% to 0.1%. No deleterious effects of marijuana use on the fetus have been confirmed.Long-term marijuana use may lead to addiction, with use continuing despite interference with family life, school, work, and recreation. Tolerance may occur after several days of regular use. Withdrawal symptoms after heavy use peak by day 4 and resolve by 2 weeks. These symptoms include irritability, insomnia, malaise, drug craving, diaphoresis, night sweats, gastrointestinal disturbances, and agitation.Screening for drug use and addictive symptoms is part of comprehensive adolescent care. Anticipatory guidance should include information about marijuana's addictive potential; injury risk; and possible impairment of learning, socialization, and sexual function. Parents should be encouraged to rehearse strategies to help teenagers avoid drug-using settings. Skills-based interventions in schools have helped increase drug knowledge, decision-making, self-esteem, and peer pressure resistance and have led to reduced marijuana use. Interventions in nonschool settings, motivational interviewing, and some family interventions also may help prevent marijuana use.Marijuana and its metabolites are detectable in urine by enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique starting 1 hour after smoking. The urine assay usually remains positive up to 10 days after infrequent use and up to 30 days in heavy users. Some urine tests may detect passive inhalation of second-hand marijuana smoke. False-positive results may occur from ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; false-negative results may follow urine dilution or adulteration. Various urine and saliva tests as well as adulterants to modify the tests are available on the Internet. Care must be taken to avoid contamination, dilution, or substitution when obtaining urine samples for testing.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports voluntary confidential drug testing to ensure that adolescents seek care. Although parents may ask a physician to test their teenagers for evidence of drug use, the AAP states: “Testing adolescents requires their consent unless (1) a patient lacks decision-making capacity; or (2) there are strong medical indications or legal requirements to do so.” Although recent court decisions allow schools to perform random drug tests on middle and high school students participating in extracurricular activities, the AAP has opposed school-based testing unless part of a funded, comprehensive approach to addressing substance abuse.Comment: Some of the most challenging encounters I have experienced have involved parents asking for drug testing for their adolescent children. Working toward a trusting relationship between the adolescent and parent is critical, and negotiating these situations has been enhanced by the AAP statement on this topic: that the drug-testing procedure should be done with the adolescent’s consent, and positive results should be used as a mechanism to get treatment for the patient, not punishment. Facilitating this dialogue and helping the adolescent patient know that both family and pediatrician have his or her best interests in mind are essential.Much controversy has arisen over legalizing marijuana use. Those who are opposed worry that access will be easier for children and adolescents and enhance unwanted drug use. Those who are in favor think that the therapeutic potential of pain relief, increase in appetite, and nausea control could be beneficial for select patients with AIDS, cancer, and multiple sclerosis. More research is needed to determine the best way to approach this public health issue in controlling distribution to those who would benefit medically while minimizing risk from recreational use.",

Bothconditions are associated with, and perhaps due to, a personality prob-lem.

In addition, alcoholism is an important factor predisposingto drug addiction. It is, of course, true that the differences betweenopiate addiction andalcoholism are as great, or greater than the similari-ties. It is knownthatthemajorityofpeoplecanusealcoholinmoderationwithout abusing it; it is believed that the majority of individuals cannotuse opiates in moderation, and that most persons who experiment withopiates become addicted. Long continued abuse of alcohol leads tostructural changes in the liver and other organs, largely as a result ofthe nutritional deficiencies associated with alcoholism. Opiate addictionper se causes no anatomical changes in the body and is not usuallyassociated with frank nutritional deficiency disease. The organic com-plications of drug addiction are chiefly infections-malaria, hepatitis,and bacterial endocarditis-which result from unsterile injections. In",

      "abstract": "The Cannabis sativa plant has historically been used for both recreational and medical purposes. With the recent surge in recreational use of cannabis among adolescents and adults in particular, there is an increased obligation to determine the short- and long-term effects that consuming this plant may have on several aspects of the human psyche and body. The goal of this article was to examine the negative effects of obesity, and how the use of Δ9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) can impact rates of this global pandemic at different timepoints of life. Conflicting studies have been reported between adult and adolescents, as there are reports of THC use leading to increased weight due to elevated appetite and consumption of food, while others observed a decrease in overall body weight due to the regulation of omega-6/omega-3 endocannabinoid precursors and a decrease in energy expenditure. Studies supported a positive correlation between prenatal cannabis use and obesity rates in the children as they matured. The data did not indicate a direct connection between prenatal THC levels in cannabis and obesity rates, but that this development may occur due to prenatal THC consumption leading to low birthweight, and subsequent obesity. There are few studies using animal models that directly measure the effects that prenatal THC administration on obesity risks among offspring. Thus, this is a critical area for future studies using a developmental framework to examine potential changes in risk across development.",

Nicotine addiction may be one of the most common in the world, but many people underestimate the health hazards of nicotine. This report, presents nicotine in four parts: harms and addiction; research; conclusions, and further implications. Because nicotine is not like most banned drugs on the market-nicotine cannot be absorbed directly, people must be exposed to nicotine through a certain medium. The most common and intuitive way is through smoking, secondhand smoke, and e-cigarettes. However, most people don’t start smoking because of nicotine addiction, so the authors of this paper conducted experiments on why people start smoking late. Through self-made questionnaires and online experimental surveys, the results showed people were exposed to smoking because of environmental factors, social factors, psychological factors, and so on. People were exposed to nicotine for too long due to their addiction to cigarettes, which evolved into an addiction to nicotine. In the later stage, due to the addictive nature of nicotine, people no longer smoke because of the original addiction to smoking, but because they want to meet the needs of nicotine.",

      "title": "Continuous nicotine exposure does not affect resurgence of alcohol seeking in rats",
      "abstract": "Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the United States and alcohol abuse can lead to alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use disorder is a persistent condition and relapse rates following successful remission are high. Many factors have been associated with relapse for alcohol use disorder, but identification of these factors has not been well translated into preventative utility. One potentially important factor, concurrent nicotine use, has not been well investigated as a causal factor in relapse for alcohol use disorder. Nicotine increases the value of other stimuli in the environment and may increase the value of alcohol. If nicotine increases the value of alcohol, then nicotine use during and after treatment may make relapse more probable. In the current study, we investigated the effect of continuous nicotine exposure (using osmotic minipumps to deliver nicotine or saline, depending on group, at a constant rate for 28 days) on resurgence of alcohol seeking in rats. Resurgence is a type of relapse preparation that consists of three phases: Baseline, Alternative Reinforcement, and Resurgence Testing. During Baseline, target responses produced a dipper of alcohol. During Alternative Reinforcement, target responses were extinguished and responses on a chain produced a chocolate pellet. During Resurgence Testing, responses on the chain were also extinguished and a return to responding on the target lever was indicative of resurgence. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the effect of nicotine on resurgence. Both the nicotine and saline group showed resurgence of alcohol seeking, but there was no difference in the degree of resurgence across groups. Future directions could involve testing alternative drug delivery techniques.",

In both conditions, a non-deprived baseline was followed by performance tests 2, 6 and 24 h later, while subjective feelings were assessed every 2 h. Compared to normal smoking, abstinence led to reduced heart rate, worse task performance, feelings of depression, stress, irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, and urges to smoke. Letter cancellation and number vigilance task performance were significantly poorer after 2 and 6 h of abstinence. Subjective feeling states were significantly worse after 4 h of abstinence, and became increasingly impaired over the rest of the day. However many abstinence symptoms (except heart rate), were reduced in severity at the 24-h session, held on the morning of the following day. This suggests that many of the psychological effects of smoking abstinence, may build-up afresh each day.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Measurement of tobacco consumption relies heavily on self-reported information. Such information includes the number and type of manufactured cigarettes or cigars smoked daily, or the amount of ‘roll your own’ cigarette tobacco, or of pipe tobacco used. There is no reliable way of validating this self-reported information and it is generally felt that people underestimate the amount they smoke. Blood nicotine (or cotinine) levels vary widely and are not simply related to the amount smoked but to the way smoking is carried out as well as to quantity. Various questionnaires are available to measure tobacco consumption and an example is provided in Table 19.1.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine addiction is a complex process that begins with self-administration. Consequently, this process has been studied extensively using animal models. A person is usually not called \"smoker\" if s/he has smoked for a week or a month in a lifetime; in general, a smoker has been smoking for many years. Furthermore, a smoker has free access to cigarettes and can smoke whenever she/he wants, provided there are no social/legal restraints. Subsequently, in an animal model of tobacco addiction, it will be desirable to expose the animal to free access nicotine for 24 hours/day for many weeks, starting at different stages of development. Oral nicotine self-administration studies in rodents present some important advantages and mimic human smoking nicely. For example, animals are not food deprived, are exposed to nicotine choice for up to 24 hours a day for extended periods, environmental cues and learning does not interfere with self-administration of nicotine. Oral alcohol selfadministration has been used in rodents for over five decades and has contributed significantly to the understanding of alcohol addiction. We provide a review of literature and compare oral alcohol and nicotine intake in rodents. Methodological issues, post ingestional and systemic effects, discrimination and the important influences of taste, genetic vulnerability, sex and age on intake are discussed. The review ends with recommendations for future research on oral self-administration of nicotine.",

Nontherapeutic use of psychoactive drugs poses an important danger to individual persons and society. What are the quantitative estimates of these risks? Are they acceptable?Because the basic mechanism of the toxic effect of alcohol or other drugs is unknown, deciding on acceptable risks is difficult. Based on current information, the recreational abuse of inhalants, hallucinogens, stimulants, narcotics and sedative-hypnotic drugs poses unacceptable individual and societal risks. Groups at special risk should not consume alcohol or any drug unless they are under medical supervision. The threshold for increased morbidity from the regular use of alcohol in adults is in the range of three to five drinks per day; this rises sharply after six drinks per day. The apparent \"safe\" level of alcohol consumption appears to be one to two drinks per day. Further basic studies are required to refine these risk estimates.",

Alcohol readily crosses the placenta and enters the fetus' bloodstream. Alcohol is metabolized and eliminated much more slowly in the fetus and in the newborn than in the mother. Recreational drugs such as heroin, methadone, cocaine, crack, and marijuana have been noted to have deleterious effects on the fetus and newborn when used by the mother during pregnancy. The exercise of pregnant women must be closely monitored because of the dramatic physiological changes induced by pregnancy. The immediate effect of exercise is that blood is diverted from the uterus to the legs. Drinking alcohol, using cocaine, and engaging in exercise programs are not isolated events randomly distributed across the population. Contradictions between animal and human studies may be due to the voluntary nature of exercise in humans, which may be less stressful than forced exercise or other stressors used in animal studies.",

Approximately one-third of Americans have tried the substance at least once. Despite its popularity, few people smoke marijuana regularly. Less than 5% of Americans report using the drug every week. Estimating the number of users is difficult because people lie or forget about their use. The amounts that people consume are also hard to estimate. A variety of definitions of misuse of the drug exist that include addiction, dependence, abuse, and problems. Addiction does not have a universal definition, making the term difficult to use scientifically. Abuse and dependence are diagnosed reliably and can clearly apply to problem marijuana users. Nevertheless, the abuse and dependence diagnoses may not provide the clear information one might learn from a simple list of marijuana problems.",

Currently, recreational use or peer modelling leads an individual to substance abuse. The magnitude of the problem of addiction increases multifold in the presence of stressors like broken families, joblessness, occupational stress, etc.The de-addiction process is used to relieve an individual's craving for the drug. It is a painful process, as several effects of withdrawal compel a person to return to the drugs again and again. Our aim is to explore the available literature on the use of Unani medicine for de-addiction.We surveyed various classical books from the available literature for drug de-addiction in Unani medicine. Indexed journals were also surveyed for the available related material using various keywords like \"opium addiction\" and \"Unani medicine and de-addiction \" and the information was filtered for this review.We observed that there was an elaborate scheme for de-addiction in opium addiction and the process is so general that it could serve as a framework for the de-addiction process for other similar drugs.Unani medicine is significant in the literature as being among the the available de-addiction addiction processes and may furnish several leads for various herbal drugs that may be used for de-addiction in the future.",

Malgre la connaissance generale des risques lies a la consommation de tabac et l'envie de la majorite des fumeurs d'arreter de fumer, pres de 20% de notre population selon les dernieres enquetes restent fumeurs. Il est en effet difficile d'arreter de fumer car le tabac est une drogue responsable d'une dependance psychologique et, selon la quantite fumee, d'une dependance physique. La prise en charge globale du tabagisme devra donc stimuler et entretenir la motivation a l'arret, assurer un accompagnement psychologique pendant et apres la periode de sevrage et traiter la dependance physique. La motivation, variable en fonction du stade de maturation du fumeur, est essentielle lors de l'arret du tabac. Stimuler et entretenir la motivation necessite resonance, empathie et ecoute active lors d'entretiens motivationnels par exemple. La dependance psychologique est liee au plaisir de fumer, a la gestion du stress ou de l'appetit en fumant, a la detente, a la convivialite, au geste, a l'habitude. L'accompagnement psychologique faisant appel notamment aux therapies cognitivo-comportementales veillera des lors a aider le fumeur a gerer le stress, a vivre positivement et a s'affirmer. D'autres aides paralleles ayant un effet placebo peuvent etre utiles telles l'homeopathie, l'hypnose ou l'acupuncture. La nicotine est le principal compose de la fumee de tabac responsable de la dependance physique, par fixation sur les neurones dopaminergiques de la zone de recompense du cerveau, mimant l'action de l'acetylcholine. Cette fixation favorise la liberation de divers neuromediateurs impliques dans les phenomenes de l'humeur. Lors de l'arret, le fumeur dependant peut souffrir d'un syndrome de sevrage. Cette dependance physique peut etre evaluee sur base de questionnaire, du test de Fagerstrom ou de dosages biologiques. Jusqu'a present, le bupropion et les substituts nicotiniques voire la nortriptyline sont des medications recommandees pour leur efficacite dans l'aide a l'arret du tabac. Certains phenomenes annexes frequents lors de l'arret du tabac ne sont pas a negliger: la prise de poids et l'apparition d'une tendance depressive voire d'une depression. Le suivi dietetique et de l'humeur est important, necessitant parfois une prise en charge specifique et un traitement. Le sevrage tabagique est donc un phenomene complexe impliquant des mecanismes psychiques et physiopathologiques que nous devons connaitre afin de pouvoir aider efficacement le fumeur non seulement lors de l'arret du tabac mais aussi afin de prevenir la rechute.",

      "title": "Role of nicotine pharmacokinetics in nicotine addiction and nicotine replacement therapy: a review.",
      "abstract": "Smoking is a complex behaviour involving both pharmacological and psychological components. Nicotine is the main alkaloid found in tobacco, and is responsible for its addictive potential. Nicotine-positive effects on mood and cognition are strong reinforcements for smokers that contribute to their addiction, and cigarette smoking is particularly addictive because inhaled nicotine is absorbed through the pulmonary venous rather than the systemic venous system, and thus reaches the brain in 10-20 seconds. As the likelihood that a substance will be abused depends on the time between administration and central reinforcement, tobacco smoking can easily become addictive. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is available in different forms (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler, sublingual tablet and lozenge), and has been shown to relieve withdrawal symptoms and to double abstinence rates compared to placebo. Most NRT forms deliver nicotine more slowly than smoking, and the increase in nicotine blood levels is more gradual. Compared to tobacco smoking or even tobacco chewing, few positive (reinforcing) effects are obtained from NRT use. Nasal spray provides faster withdrawal relief than other NRT, but compared to smoking absorption is slower and nicotine blood levels obtained are lower than with smoking. These differences in pharmacokinetic profiles compared with smoking may explain that some smokers still have difficulties quitting smoking even when using NRT (apart from psychological and/or social factors). Combination therapy (e.g., patch+gum, patch+inhaler), higher dosage, temporary abstinence or smoking reduction (using NRT to reduce smoke intake) may be needed to help more smokers to quit.",

      "title": "“Should Patients With Substance Use Disorders Be Prescribed Benzodiazepines?” No",
      "abstract": "Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) should not use benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, insomnia, or anything else, for the same reasons that they should not drink any alcohol or use other drugs, regardless of their primary drug used. Once the addiction “switch” is thrown on, it never again goes off. This question has additional relevance today because in 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration put black box warnings on all benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics about the serious risks associated with their concomitant use. Anxiety is not a benzodiazepine-deficiency disease. It is possible to treat anxiety and insomnia without medicines of any kind, and it is possible to use medicines other than benzodiazepines for these common and serious mental disorders. Although many patients with SUDs are eager to use benzodiazepines, using alternatives is often effective and it does not put the patient's recovery in jeopardy. The standard I propose here is based on the experience of many people with SUDs who have tried and failed to use benzodiazepines for anxiety.",

      "title": "Die Prävalenz und Ausprägung von Persönlichkeitsstörungen bei Ecstasykonsumenten",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung\r\n\r\nEcstasy ist die am haufigsten konsumierte synthetische Droge, im Jahr 2000 erreichte die Anzahl der vom BKA beschlagnahmten Tabletten erneut eine Rekordhohe. Gleichzeitig steigt die Zahl der Berichte uber medizinische Komplikationen – auch mit Todesfolge. Inzwischen mehren sich Hinweise darauf, das der dauerhafte Konsum groserer Mengen von Ecstasy neurotoxische Auswirkungen haben konnte, deren langfristige Folgen nicht absehbar sind.\r\nWelche Faktoren tragen zur Entwicklung eines Risikokonsums beziehungsweise einer Abhangigkeit bei? Bei Alkohol- und Drogenabhangigen konnte gezeigt werden, das Personlichkeitsstorungen, allen voran die antisoziale und Borderline Personlichkeitsstorung, einen starken Einflus auf die Entstehung, Aufrechterhaltung und den Verlauf der Erkrankung haben. Zum Missbrauch von Ecstasy ist die Datenlage diesbezuglich noch unzureichend.\r\n\r\nDies ist die erste Studie, die der Frage nach der Pravalenz und Auspragung von Personlichkeitsstorungen an einer groseren Stichprobe von Ecstasykonsumenten nachgegangen ist. Dazu wurden unter Verwendung zweier Selbstratinginstrumente (Personality Disorder Questionaire, PDQ-R und Inventar Klinischer Personlichkeitsakzentuierungen, IKP) 57 Ecstasykonsumenten (31 mannlich, 26 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 23 Jahre) mit 30 Konsumenten anderer illegaler Drogen (19 mannlich, 11 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 22 Jahre) sowie 7 Abstinenten (3 mannlich, 4 weiblich, Durchschnittsalter 22 Jahre) verglichen. Im nachsten Schritt wurden die Ecstasykonsumenten nach dem Schweregrad des Konsums drei Gruppen zugeteilt, die ebenfalls miteinander verglichen wurden.\r\nNach den Ergebnissen der vorliegenden Studie haben Ecstasykonsumenten und insbesondere –abhangige im Vergleich zu ecstasy- sowie drogenabstinenten Kontrollen mit identischem subkulturellem Hintergrund, aber auch gegenuber der Allgemeinbevolkerung und gleichaltrigen Studenten eine erhohte Pravalenz und Auspragung von Personlichkeitsstorungen. Die Zahlen liegen etwa auf dem Niveau von Patienten eines stationaren Drogenentwohnungsprogramms. Weiterhin zeigen sich teilweise signifikante Zusammenhange zwischen der Auspragung einzelner Personlichkeitsstorungen und dem Schweregrad des Konsums von Ecstasy und anderen Drogen.\r\nEcstasykonsumenten fallen durch teilweise signifikant erhohte Werte insbesondere fur Personlichkeitsstorungen aus dem Cluster B auf, was konsistent ist mit anderen Studien, die bei Ecstasykonsumenten eine Pragnanz von Personlichkeitszugen gefunden haben, die den Cluster B Personlichkeitsstorungen zugrunde liegen. Diejenigen Ecstasykonsumenten, deren Gebrauchsmuster die ICD-10 Abhangigkeitskriterien erfullen, unterscheiden sich von den Kontrollen daruber hinaus durch eine starkere Belastung bei den Cluster C Personlichkeitsstorungen, was als Hinweis auf Probleme aus dem angstlich-dysphorischen Bereich gewertet wird. Dieses Ergebnis deckt sich mit Ergebnissen anderer Studien, die auf eine erhohte depressive Belastung von Ecstasykonsumenten hindeuten. \r\n\r\nDie Frage, inwieweit diese Ergebnisse durch vorbestehende Personlichkeitseigenschaften, mogliche neurotoxische Folgen des Ecstasykonsums, den Konsum anderer Drogen sowie durch methodische Schwierigkeiten insbesondere bei der Diagnostik von Personlichkeitsstorungen beeinflust worden sind, wird ausfuhrlich diskutiert. \r\n\r\nAls weiteres wichtiges Ergebnis dieser Studie ist die niedrige Pravalenz der antisozialen Personlichkeitsstorung zu nennen, die mit 9% in der Gesamtgruppe der Ecstasykonsumenten und 14% bei den Ecstasyabhangigen unter der Zahl liegt, die bei Alkohol-, Opiat- und Kokainabhangigen gefunden werden. Dieses Ergebnis ist wahrscheinlich auf verschiedene Faktoren wie eine grostenteils bessere soziale Integration von Ecstasykonsumenten, substanzspezifische Unterschiede sowie die mangelnde Validitat der antisozialen Personlichkeitsstorung zuruckzufuhren.\r\n\r\nZusammengefast weist diese Studie auf die wichtige Rolle von Personlichkeitsstorungen bei der Entwicklung von Misbrauch- und Abhangigkeitsmustern von Ecstasy hin. Fur die Zukunft ware es wunschenswert, diejenigen Konsumenten, bei denen Hinweise auf das Vorhandensein einer Personlichkeitsstorung vorliegen beispielsweise unter Verwendung semistrukturierter Interviews genauer zu betrachten. Daruber hinaus weist diese Studie auf die Unterschiede zu Abhangigen herkommlicher Drogen und die daraus folgende Notwendigkeit fur speziell auf Ecstasykonsumenten zugeschnittene Hilfsangebote hin.",

Changing cultural values, increasing economic stress and dwindling supportive bonds are leading to initiation into substance use. Cannabis, heroin, and Indian-produced pharmaceutical drugs are the most frequently abused drugs in India. Drug use, misuse or abuse is also primarily due to the nature of the drug abused, the personality of the individual and the addict’s immediate environment. The processes of industrialization, urbanization and migration have led to loosening of the traditional methods of social control rendering an individual vulnerable to the stresses and strains of modern life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Markedly differing views can be found among both clinicians and researchers regarding whether alcohol withdrawal is a phenomenon of any practical or theoretical importance. Evidence has mounted that alcohol withdrawal, even in a severe form, is rarely life–threatening and the great majority of cases can be managed in non–medical settings, including the home. There is also a widely held view among clinicians that withdrawal symptoms have little motivational significance and may be best regarded as but epiphenomena of prolonged heavy drinking. There are also experimental data from both human and animal laboratory studies to the effect that withdrawal symptoms do not readily trigger further alcohol consumption. Against this most unpromising background a case is presented for alcohol withdrawal being but one manifestation of important biological and psychological adaptive processes which occur almost whenever alcohol is consumed with any regularity. It is proposed that understanding this more general phenomenon is critical to a better understanding of the factors which maintain heavy and problematic drinking. Recent evidence also suggests that minor alcohol withdrawal symptoms are far more common in the general population than had previously been realized, and that this has important implications for prevention policy.",

      "abstract": "Smoking cessation aids appear to be limited in their ability to prevent craving triggered by exposure to smoking-associated stimuli; however, the extent to which cue-induced cravings persist following denicotinized or nicotine-containing tobacco smoking is not known.Thirty (17 male) ⩾12-hour abstinent dependent smokers completed two sessions during which they smoked a nicotine-containing or denicotinized cigarette. Instructions regarding the nicotine content of the cigarette varied across sessions, and all participants were exposed to a neutral cue followed by a smoking cue after cigarette consumption. Craving was assessed before and after cigarette consumption and cue exposure.Reduced intentions to smoke were associated with both nicotine expectancy (p<0.05) and nicotine administration (p<0.01), while reduced withdrawal-related craving was uniquely associated with nicotine administration (p<0.05). Smoking-associated stimuli increased craving regardless of nicotine expectancy or administration (p-values<0.001).While both nicotine pharmacology and expectancy appear to contribute to craving reduction associated with acute tobacco smoking, neither smoking-related nicotine administration nor expectation prevents increases in craving following exposure to smoking-associated stimuli. These findings suggest that cue-induced craving may be resistant to various pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

The tobacco plant was named Nicotiana tabacum after Jean Nicot, who promoted his belief that the plant had medicinal value. Nicotine, the basic addicting drug contained in cigarettes, may be the deadliest drug known to humans in terms of overall morbidity and mortality. The morbidity and mortality from nicotine addiction is greater than that from World Wars I and II, the Vietnam War, AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), and heroin and cocaine addiction combined. Tobacco use is linked to more than 390 000 deaths per year in the United States alone. The powerful lobbying forces of the tobacco industry have managed to keep supplies of nicotine available to the public despite efforts from medical and legal bodies to reduce advertising and educate the public about the adverse consequences of nicotine use. The addictive potential of cigarettes and the extent to which nicotine is the active ingredient in generating and sustaining addiction has been debated. The reasons for the resistance to considering whether nicotine is addictive have origins in attitudes toward addiction. Free will and personal choice have prevailed as explanations for why a 20-cigarette per day smoker will receive more then 70 000 boluses of nicotine per year despite the high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with this drug.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol addiction is simply defined as a compulsive need for an intoxicating liquid that is obtained from fermented grain or fruit. These liquids include beer, wine, and other hard liquors. One misconception that many alcoholic and addicts seem to have is that their drinking is not affecting anyone else. Many times they make statements like, “I am not hurting anyone but myself”. There is a great deal of research and a vast amount of anecdotal evidence that the behavior of addicts and alcoholics can affect everyone around them, including family, friends, employers and coworkers. Addicted family members are more likely to be violent or emotionally abusive, and when abuse is not a factor; households affected by addiction can be highly disordered, unstable and unloving. If one have a drinking problem and have children in home, they are being affected, sometimes so profoundly that the effects last their entire life time. The most vulnerable effects of alcoholism or addiction are the children. The children of people with alcohol problems usually suffer greatly. Children of alcoholics have deep-seated psychological and emotional reactions to growing up with an addicted parent. Children of addicts often grow up socially isolated and they tend to develop emotional difficulties and behavioral problems. As they grow up, these type of issues can lead to antisocial behavior, mood disorders, and drug and alcohol abuse. Children of addicts often develop feeling of anger and resentment towards their parents. Therefore alcohol addiction is recognized as significant barriers of the empowerment of children, with the consequences of child's health, their health-seeking behavior and their adaptation of the family norms. Studies have shown that a child may be more likely to follow in footsteps of his parents and have the same addictive behaviors. It is vital that children have a positive and honest relationship with their parents. Those who suffer from alcohol abuse need to seek help immediately in oreder to restore and improve the family relationship. There are many supportive groups and programs available to help those families that are dealing with addiction. the first step is realizing that one drinking has become a problem, and the second step is willing to do something about the problem.",

      "abstract": "As a growing number of people use e-cigarettes regularly, it becomes increasingly important to understand the psychobiological effects of vaping. This chapter reviews evidence into these effects. Nicotine e-cigarettes influence all major systems in the body. For instance, vaping increases dopamine activity in the brain's reward pathway, raises heart rate and blood pressure, and may dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. These physiological changes have psychological consequences for addiction, cognition, mood, anxiety and appetite. First, e-cigarettes appear more addictive than nicotine replacement therapy, such as patches and gum, but less so than cigarettes. E-cigarettes that use nicotine salts deliver nicotine more efficiently, so may be more addictive. Second, vaping may lead to short-term improvements in cognitive performance, as nicotine can improve memory and attention. Third, e-cigarette users report mood enhancing and anxiety reducing effects of vaping, but these effects may result from the alleviation of withdrawal symptoms. Further research will help determine whether vaping causes depression and anxiety, or vice versa. Finally, vaping likely suppresses appetite and reduces weight gain.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes: Are we renormalizing public smoking? Reversing five decades of tobacco control and revitalizing nicotine dependency in children and youth in Canada",
      "abstract": "An electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) is a battery attached to a chamber containing liquid that may (or may not) contain nicotine. The battery heats the liquid and converts it into a vapour, which is inhaled, mimicking tobacco smoking. The e-cigarette does not rely on tobacco as a source of nicotine but, rather, vaporizes a liquid for inhalation. E-liquids are often flavoured and may contain nicotine in various concentrations, although actual amounts are seldom accurately reflected in container labelling. The deleterious effects of nicotine on paediatric health are well established. The use of e-cigarettes in the paediatric age group is on the rise in Canada, as are associated nicotine poisonings. E-devices generate substantial amounts of fine particulate matter, toxins and heavy metals at levels that can exceed those observed for conventional cigarettes. Children and youth are particularly susceptible to these atomized products. Action must be taken before these devices become a more established public health hazard. Policies to denormalize tobacco smoking in society and historic reductions in tobacco consumption may be undermined by this new 'gateway' product to nicotine dependency. La cigarette électronique (vapoteuse) est une batterie fixée à un réservoir rempli d’un liquide qui peut (ou non) contenir de la nicotine. La batterie réchauffe le liquide et le convertit en vapeur, qui est inhalée afin d’imiter le tabagisme. La source de nicotine de la vapoteuse ne provient pas du tabac, mais le dispositif vaporise un liquide en vue de son inhalation. Ces e-liquides, souvent aromatisés, peuvent contenir de la nicotine sous diverses concentrations, mais leur quantité réelle est rarement bien indiquée sur l’emballage. Les effets délétères de la nicotine sur la santé sont bien établis dans le groupe d’âge pédiatrique. Le vapotage est en hausse au sein de ce groupe au Canada, de même que les intoxications à la nicotine qui y sont associées. Les vapoteuses produisent de grandes quantités de particules fines, de toxines et de métaux lourds, à des taux qui peuvent dépasser ceux de la cigarette conventionnelle. Les enfants et les adolescents sont particulièrement susceptibles à ces produits atomisés. Il faut agir avant que ces dispositifs deviennent un danger mieux établi en santé publique. Cette nouvelle « porte d’accès » à la dépendance à la nicotine pourrait saboter les politiques visant à « dénormaliser » le tabagisme dans la société, ainsi que les réductions historiques de consommation du tabac.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cocaine addiction is a significant problem in the United States and treatment is hampered by high relapse rates. This is particularly the case with crack cocaine because it is smoked and consequently has a rapid but relatively short‐lived effect on the brain. This readily creates a cycle of craving and dependence. Moreover, the multiple environmental cues associated with the craving set up powerful conditions for relapse. This paper describes an Ericksonian approach alongside more traditional hypnotic techniques. In particular, the methods of utilization and orientation to the future are described and a one‐year follow‐up is discussed. Copyright © 1999 British Society of Experimental and Clinical Hypnosis",

      "abstract": "Obesity is one of the pandemic chronic diseases commonly associated with health disorders such as heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes or even cancer. Among the current natural products for obesity and weight control, Garcinia or more specifically hydroxycitric acid (HCA) extracted from Garcinia has been widely used. The evaluation of the potential toxicity of weight control supplement is of the utmost importance as it requires long term continuous consumption in order to maintain its effects. Majority of reports demonstrated the efficacy of Garcinia/HCA without any toxicity found. However, a few clinical toxicity reports on weight-loss diet supplements of which some were combinations that included Garcinia/HCA as an active ingredient showed potential toxicity towards spermatogenesis. Nonetheless, it cannot be concluded that Garcinia/HCA is unsafe. Those products which have been reported to possess adverse effects are either polyherbal or multi-component in nature. To date, there is no case study or report showing the direct adverse effect of HCA. The structure, mechanism of action, long history of the use of Garcinia/HCA and comprehensive scientific evidence had shown \"no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL)\" at levels up to 2800 mg/day, suggesting its safety for use.",

In just a few short years, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become increasingly popular, especially for younger individuals. Many people believe that e-cigarettes are safe. The inhaled aerosols of e-cigarettes contain numerous potential toxicities, some of which could be dangerous for health with long-term use. The safety of prolonged aerosol exposure is not known. The use of e-cigarettes as a harm-reduction tool at stopping tobacco smoking is not uniformly successful. E-cigarettes may be safer than tobacco products, but repeated prolonged exposure to their aerosols has its own considerable potential risk. The long-term health consequences of their use remain to be established. Physicians should vigorously discourage the use of e-cigarettes and tobacco products, with special emphasis on abstinence for younger people and during pregnancy or lactation.",

This chapter addresses the following questions to provide an overview of cannabis addiction. What is the neurobiology that underlies cannabis addiction? What factors make some individuals more vulnerable than others to developing cannabis addiction? Why do only a minority of people who are addicted seek treatment? How effective are currently available pharmacological and psychological treatments? Would delivering therapy remotely increase treatment uptake by reducing stigma? Increasingly across the globe cannabis is available for medicinal use so how can we minimize these patients' risk of addiction? How can drug policy be used to promote harm reduction by providing a safer, regulated market and lower potency cannabis products?",

People continue to smoke cigarettes in the face of adversity because they contain nicotine, which is highly addictive. Nicotine is a stimulant that exerts its effects within the brain by acting at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). nAChRs are located in areas of the brain involved in reward processing, motivation, and cognitive control, which results in disruptions to behaviour when nicotine addiction has developed. Disturbances to the brain and behaviour are particularly evident during early nicotine abstinence when people are in withdrawal. Importantly, treatments (e.g. varenicline, bupropion) that attenuate disturbances to reward and cognition in the brain during withdrawal in early nicotine abstinence are conferred with the efficacy to promote smoking cessation and protect against relapse.",

The purpose of this study was to understand cannabis use for pain in West Virginia patients. Ten thousand chronic pain patients were surveyed, and users and non-users of cannabis were compared. One thousand three hundred fifty-one people responded, with 24% using cannabis. They were in pain for longer, most >10 years. They often used other medications for pain and more often had a previous opioid prescription for pain. Patients who use cannabis have higher levels of reported pain for longer durations of time than those who do not use cannabis. More information is needed to understand the implications for cannabis use in this population. Patients with chronic pain who use cannabis have tried multiple treatment modalities, had more types of pain, and often received an opioid prescription.",

      "abstract": "The world in which we live sets us in a reality fuelled by the existence of a large variety of psychogenic substances. The temptation of drugs has been verified since ancient times in the human society. The classical definition of drugs is established by the World Health Organization as substances which, once absorbed by a living organism, can alter one or more of its functions. Currently, \"drug\" can be understood as any substance that leads to psychoactive effects that favour the repetition of consumption due to the installation of the state of pleasure, which is considered to be motivated by the consumer. The consequences of non-management of psychoactive substances lead to the establishment of a degrading physical, psychological condition, namely addiction. Drug consumption among adolescents has several particular aspects due to the lack of fully defined personality traits, which can lead to increased vulnerability of children and adolescents due to the negative socio-familial climate. The present work presents the theme of psychoactive substances and its effects drug use among young people aged between 16 and 22 years. The motives that lead young people to drug use, the environment in which they perceive that drug use is frequent, and the way young people are aware of the effects of drug use on people who consume it have been followed. The methodology used to achieve the purpose of this paper is the questionnaire applied to a total of 30 young people, and the answers received are the result of this investigation.",

A serious drug misuse problem in the parents can be devastating for the lives of their children.1Addiction to opiates, most commonly heroin, is one of the forms of drug misuse that is potentially most damaging to the child's home environment. Recent figures produced by the European Commission suggest that about 0.2–0.3% of European adults fulfil diagnostic criteria for heroin addiction at any given time,2 and higher rates exist in inner city areas. Department of Health figures suggest that heroin use is the form of drug misuse most commonly presented to treatment services in the United Kingdom.3 \n\nThe financial pressure of obtaining large sums of money (typically £10–100 a day) to buy heroin can lock a person into a daily cycle of seeking out, buying, and using heroin, which can lead to poverty, criminal activity, and imprisonment.4 Chaotic lifestyles may preclude attention being given to basics such as nutrition and attending appointments, and may lead to the presence of unsafe persons in the home, unsuitable carers, and frequent parental absences. Dependent heroin users are also at greatly increased risk of death from overdose, infectious diseases, and other causes.4Addiction to stimulants such as amphetamines and crack cocaine may also produce adverse home circumstances, although anonymous testing of pregnant women suggests that there does not yet appear to be the misuse of these drugs in epidemic proportions in the United Kingdom that is reported in the United States.5 \n\nIt is difficult to obtain clear figures about the scale of parental drug use and the numbers of children affected.

      "title": "Smoked Marijuana as a Cause of Lung Injury",
      "abstract": "In many societies, marijuana is the second most commonly smoked substance after tobacco. While delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is unique to marijuana and nicotine to tobacco, the smoke of marijuana, like that of tobacco, consists of a toxic mixture of gases and particulates, many of which are known to be harmful to the lung. Although far fewer marijuana than tobacco cigarettes are generally smoked on a daily basis, the pulmonary consequences of marijuana smoking may be magnified by the greater deposition of smoke particulates in the lung due to the differing manner in which marijuana is smoked. Whereas THC causes modest short-term bronchodilation, regular marijuana smoking produces a number of long-term pulmonary consequences, including chronic cough and sputum, histopathologic evidence of widespread airway inflammation and injury and immunohistochemical evidence of dysregulated growth of respiratory epithelial cells, that may be precursors to lung cancer. The THC in marijuana could contribute to some of these injurious changes through its ability to augment oxidative stress, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibit apoptosis. On the other hand, physiologic, clinical or epidemiologic evidence that marijuana smoking may lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or respiratory cancer is limited and inconsistent. Habitual use of marijuana is also associated with abnormalities in the structure and function of alveolar macrophages, including impairment in microbial phagocytosis and killing that is associated with defective production of immunostimulatory cytokines and nitric oxide, thereby potentially predisposing to pulmonary infection. In view of the growing interest in medicinal marijuana, further epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify the true risks of regular marijuana smoking on respiratory health.",

      "title": "Taurine, caffeine, and energy drinks: Reviewing the risks to the adolescent brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract Energy drinks are emerging as a major component of the beverage market with sales projected to top $60 billion globally in the next five years. Energy drinks contain a variety of ingredients, but many of the top‐selling brands include high doses of caffeine and the amino acid taurine. Energy drink consumption by children has raised concerns, due to potential caffeine toxicity. An additional risk has been noted among college‐aged consumers of energy drinks who appear at higher risk of over‐consumption of alcohol when the two drinks are consumed together. The differential and combinatorial effects of caffeine and taurine on the developing brain are reviewed here with an emphasis on the adolescent brain, which is still maturing. Key data from animal studies are summarized to highlight both reported benefits and adverse effects reported following acute and chronic exposures. The data suggest that age is an important factor in both caffeine and taurine toxicity. Although the aged or diseased brain might benefit from taurine or caffeine supplementation, it appears that adolescents are not likely to benefit from supplementation and may, in fact, suffer ill effects from chronic ingestion of high doses. Additional work is needed though to address gaps in our understanding of how taurine affects females, since the majority of animal studies focused exclusively on male subjects.",

First, the differential prohibition of drugs changes over time, depending upon the demands and views within society. Secondly, we must not forget that the most widely available drugs include alcohol, caffeine and nicotine. We must therefore realise that the use of psychoactive substances is the norm and not necessarily deviant. It is this common experience (irrespective of the substance used) that should inform policy, practice and ethical considerations in this difficult and challenging area of work.",

      "title": "A Bridge Too Far: Individuals With Regular and Increasing Very Heavy Alcohol Consumption Cannot be Considered as Maintaining “Recovery” Due to Toxicity and Intoxication-related Risks",
      "abstract": "The concept of “recovery” from alcohol use disorders (AUD) has garnered increasing scientific interest in recent years including attempts to explicate and measure its presumed component parts. In general, there is consensus that “recovery” should not be solely about abstinence or quantity-frequency measures of alcohol consumption and should include measures of functioning. Some researchers have taken an even more radical step, however, to suggest that psychosocial functioning should be the sine qua non defining feature of “recovery,” seemingly irrespective of how much one drinks; as such, people can be classified as achieving and maintaining successful “recovery” despite engaging in regular very heavy drinking. This commentary argues against this notion, as it goes beyond existing data and largely ignores the more insidious toxicity-related, as well as acute intoxication-related, health risks, known to occur with heavy alcohol exposure that contradict the salubrious intent of the “recovery” construct. Furthermore, classifying someone as being in successful “recovery” due to high functioning but while engaging in very heavy drinking, ignores the potential collateral damage to close significant others (eg, children, partners), whose well-being can be severely impacted by the enduring unpredictability of heavy use. Finally, it is argued that exclusive championing of “functioning,” while paying little if any attention to AUD remission or alcohol exposure status, creates a conceptual conundrum whereby someone with low functioning but who is in long-term AUD remission or completely abstinent could be classified as not achieving “recovery,” holding such individuals to a higher standard and may be stigmatizing.",

Le cannabis possede de nombreux effets secondaires, l'adolescent etant particulierement sensible a ces effets. Le medecin generaliste est en premiere ligne pour realiser de la prevention notamment au niveau des addictions.\r\nMethode : L'objectif de ce travail etait d'observer la pratique des medecins generalistes dans la prevention de cette consommation chez les adolescents. Nous avons realise une enquete qualitative avec entretiens semi-directifs chez 14 medecins generalistes installes dans le Var. \r\nResultats : Le cannabis n'est jamais aborde systematiquement par les medecins generalistes mais plutot a l'occasion de symptomes decrits par le patient ou ses parents. La recherche de cette consommation possede de nombreux freins. Souvent cette prevention se limite au depistage des consequences de la consommation de cannabis. Presque tous les medecins tentaient de realiser un sevrage conjoint de cannabis et de tabac seuls ou avec l'aide de professionnels de sante et de structures medicales. De maniere generale la prevention en France sur le cannabis est percue comme insuffisante ou non visible par les medecins generalistes. \r\nConclusion : La prevention ne peut etre effectuee uniquement par les medecins generalistes, elle devrait etre faite des la fin du primaire. Le depistage de la consommation precoce ou problematique est difficile face aux limites existantes. Une consultation dediee aux addictions ainsi que des recommandations de prise en charge chez les consommateurs avec les professionnels et les structures medicales seraient souhaitables.",

      "title": "Influences of social stress in the rewarding effects of mdma and alcohol",
      "abstract": "La adiccion a las drogas es un importante problema en nuestra sociedad con graves consecuencias juridicas, medicas y sociales para los consumidores. Se trata de un trastorno caracterizado por la perdida de control sobre el uso de la droga, su busqueda compulsiva y la aparicion de un estado emocional negativo en ausencia de la misma. El alcohol es la droga legal mas consumida tanto por adultos como por adolescentes. Por otra parte, entre las sustancias ilegales, los datos epidemiologicos apuntan que el extasis o MDMA es una sustancia ampliamente consumida entre los adolescentes y adultos jovenes sobre todo en fiestas “rave” donde los consumidores pasan horas, incluso dias, haciendo uso de esta sustancia. La adolescencia constituye un periodo de alta vulnerabilidad debido a la inmadurez cerebral, siendo muy perjudicial en esta fase de la vida el consumo de drogas y la exposicion a situaciones ambientales negativas. En concreto, se ha demostrado que el estres social puede provocar el inicio, escalada y la reinstauracion en el consumo de drogas en modelos animales. Por ello, el objetivo del presente trabajo ha sido estudiar los factores implicados en las propiedades reforzantes de MDMA (1.25 y 10 mg/kg) y alcohol (1.25 y 2.5 g/kg), principalmente el efecto del estres social agudo y repetido en ratones macho adolescentes y adultos jovenes. Una de las tecnicas metodologicas mas utilizadas ha sido la induccion de estres por derrota social mediante encuentros agonisticos (agudos o repetidos). Para evaluar si el estres social modifica el valor reforzante de la MDMA o el alcohol se ha utilizado principalmente el paradigma de condicionamiento de lugar pero tambien se ha evaluado el consumo voluntario de alcohol (“two-bottle choice”). Este procedimiento y el de autoadministracion (“second order”) se han utilizado para estudiar los efectos de los antagonistas opiaceos mu (naltrexona y GSK 1521498) en el consumo de alcohol en ratas. Asimismo otras tecnicas conductuales han sido utilizadas para medir procesos como ansiedad, memoria, aprendizaje, interaccion social o actividad motora entre otros tras la administracion de derrota, MDMA o su combinacion. Los datos obtenidos indican que la exposicion al estres social (tanto agudo como a largo plazo) incrementa los efectos reforzantes de MDMA y alcohol y produce diferentes alteraciones conductuales, por ejemplo una reduccion de la conducta social, que pueden estar relacionadas con el incremento en los efectos reforzantes. Asimismo, la combinacion de estres y MDMA induce un importante deterioro de la memoria y el estado emocional. Los antagonistas glutamatergicos (memantine y CNQX) y la inhibicion de la sintesis de oxido nitrico (7-nitroindazole) bloquean los efectos reforzantes de la MDMA y tambien parecen estar implicados en los efectos del estres. El antagonismo de los receptores opiaceos mu disminuye la busqueda y consumo de alcohol. El avance en el conocimiento de los sistemas de neurotransmision implicados en los efectos reforzantes de la MDMA y el alcohol y en la influencia del estres sobre estos efectos puede contribuir al desarrollo de estrategias farmacologicas para el tratamiento de la adiccion a la estas drogas.",

The 16 subjects in the small study selected from a larger group of 99 adults with self-identified caffeine dependence clearly do not represent a cross section of the US population. Ten of the 16 had a previous substance abuse disorder (most commonly alcohol), two had a psychiatric diagnosis, and 14 of 16 were of the same sex. In addition, although subjects were not assessed for nicotine dependence, five were smokers who had a higher caffeine consumption than the nonsmokers. Obviously, caffeine consumption is markedly different from the use of drugs of abuse. For example, steadily increasing doses are generally not associated with caffeine ingestion and, of course, the destructive antisocial behavior provoked by drugs of abuse is clearly not associated with caffeine",

Most of today's cigarette smokers, however, use tobacco daily, at intervals of less than one hour during waking hours. Since early in the twentieth century, it has been understood that this behavior is driven largely by nicotine's pharmacological actions and has little to do with the taste of nicotine. Nicotine's role in tobacco use parallels that of morphine in the use of opium derivatives. It produces CNS reinforcing effects, tolerance and physiological dependence, pharmacological effects smokers find valuable, and pleasurable effects induced by the central actions of nicotine. Nicotine and other smoke constituents also provide sensory stimuli which become conditioned reinforcers and further strengthen tobacco self-administration.",

A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance affects the activity of a drug, i.e. the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce a new effect that neither produces on its own. These interactions may occur out of accidental misuse or due to lack of knowledge about the active ingredients involved in the relevant substances. Regarding food-drug interactions physicians and pharmacists recognize that some foods and drugs, when taken simultaneously, can alter the body's ability to utilize a particular food or drug, or cause serious side effects. Clinically significant drug interactions, which pose potential harm to the patient, may result from changes in pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic properties. Some may be taken advantage of, to the benefit of patients, but more commonly drug interactions result in adverse drug events. Therefore it is advisable for patients to follow the physician and doctors instructions to obtain maximum benefits with least food-drug interactions. The literature survey was conducted by extracting data from different review and original articles on general or specific drug interactions with food. This review gives information about various interactions between different foods and drugs and will help physicians and pharmacists prescribe drugs cautiously with only suitable food supplement to get maximum benefit for the patient.",

Young people, whose brains are still developing, may experience greater and longer lasting neurobiological changes upon addiction or even mere exposure to nicotine [1]. In laboratory experiments, mice pre-exposed with nicotine via cigarette or vape demonstrated addictive behaviors around THC; however, mice pre-exposed with normal air did not demonstrate these addictive behaviors [2]. Nicotine use can also increase the rewarding feeling derived from using other mind-altering drugs; therefore, vaping itself may be a dangerous gateway that increases the propensity for other types of substance use and addiction [3].",

      "title": "MULHER DEPENDENTE QUIMICA EM TRATAMENTO EM SERVIÇO ESPECILIZADO: CASO CLINÍCO",
      "abstract": "Introducao: O consumo de substâncias psicoativas e uma caracteristica comum nas populacoes da maioria dos paises, inclusive as do Brasil, sendo o tabaco e o alcool as mais utilizadas. Muitas variaveis (ambientais, biologicas, psicologicas e sociais) atuam simultaneamente para influenciar a tendencia de qualquer pessoa vir a usar drogas e isto se deve a interacao entre o agente (a droga),o sujeito (o individuo e a sociedade) e o meio (os contextos socio-economico e cultural). O crack e uma das principais causas de busca de atendimento entre usuarios de drogas ilicitas, e uma droga com fortes propriedades estimulantes e que mais motiva o usuario a buscar tratamento, ainda que nao seja mais consumida, revela o impacto pessoal familiar dessa dependencia. Sua utilizacao produz uma euforia de grande magnitude e de curta duracao, seguida de intensa fissura e desejo de repetir a dose. O grupo iniciante consumidor da droga possui um perfil jovial. Em estudo realizado no municipio de Sao Paulo, detectou que aumentou o numero de usuarios a partir de 1989, com isso os servicos ambulatoriais comecaram a sentir o impacto do crescimento do consumo. Atualmente, o tratamento prioriza a desintoxicacao, a reducao de danos e o retorno ao convivio social. Objetivo: Conhecer as demandas da mulher usuaria de droga em tratamento de servico de saude mental. Metodo: Trata-se de um caso clinico, desenvolvido em um Centro de Atencao Psicossocial alcool e drogas, localizado no municipio de Fortaleza, Ceara, com uma mulher em uso abusivo de drogas psicoativas, com 28 anos, solteira, em situacao de rua por dois anos. Os dados foram coletados atraves da tecnica de entrevista durante uma consulta de enfermagem, seguindo-se um roteiro semiestruturado contendo perguntas fechadas e abertas. Resultados: no discurso da participante destacaram-se aspectos como a vulnerabilidade social da mulher usuaria de drogas, a vivencia de violencia psicologica e fisica, a prostituicao para a aquisicao de drogas, a exposicao em virtude da situacao de moradia de rua, prostituicao, as dificuldades no acesso ao tratamento da dependencia quimica, o preconceito relacionado ao fato de ser usuaria de psicoativos e a falta de abordagem das questoes de genero por parte dos profissionais do servico de saude. Conclusao: Foi perceptivel o fato de que as caracteristicas sociodemograficas da participante a tornaram vulneravel ao uso de drogas, as dificuldades em acessar e permanecer no tratamento em servico especializado. O abuso das mais variadas substâncias (alcool, tabaco, cocaina, maconha, crack e psicotropicos) trouxe varias demandas para o cuidado da participante, relacionados com prejuizos sociais (moradia de rua, desemprego), legais (detencoes), interpessoais (conflitos familiares) e de saude (doencas sexualmente transmissiveis, aborto e acidentes). Ressalta-se a importância no tratamento de casos de dependencia quimica e a adaptacao do mesmo as especificidades da mulher.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine consumption has increased significantly in recent years compared to global rates. This high-dose consumption is especially evident among athletes who believe consuming more caffeine is necessary for better physical performance. In addition, side effects associated with excessive daily doses of caffeine may appear more in athletes than others, depression being one of these side effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of caffeine on depression in athletes. According to research, if caffeine is consumed in acceptable amounts daily, it can increase motivation, vitality, and energy levels while also preventing depression in athletes. However, suppose consumption exceeds the recommended daily dose or reaches a level that causes symptoms similar to caffeine addiction. In this case, the side effects will far outweigh the benefits, and depression is a common issue. Finally, it can be concluded that athletes' addiction to coffee and caffeine may lead to depression-like symptoms over time. If their daily consumption is not controlled, it can contribute to depression in athletes.",

      "abstract": "Following a decade during which drug use by adolescents was viewed by many parents and other adults as a normal phase of development, the 1980s have been marked by growing awareness of the risks and costs of illegal drug use. Yet, despite the many successes of a burgeoning parents' movement, stimulated by the active leadership and support of the President and Mrs Reagan, drug use persists as a significant threat to the health and well-being of American youth. Physicians are in a powerful position to deliver health promotion messages to patients and their parents and have an obligation to do so whenever possible. Messages delivered on a routine basis can be influential in promoting smoking, alcohol, and drug abstinence. These messages should begin early and continue throughout childhood to reinforce and strengthen the development of healthy attitudes and behaviors. The pediatrician must never be reluctant to express his or her own views regarding the health consequences of drug and alcohol use to patients or their parents. Informed pediatricians represent formidable opposition to individuals who argue that \"experimental\" or \"recreational\" use of illicit substances during the developmental years is inevitable, normal, or harmless.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity and a particularly common and intractable addictive disorder. Research shows that nicotine is a sine qua non of tobacco addiction and that it produces the hallmark effects of addictive drugs: sensitization, tolerance, physical dependence, and euphoria/elation. Research on the development of smoking reveals that although smoking prevalence has declined from a peak in the mid-1990s, close to 30% of twelfth graders still smoke. Smoking in adolescents is related to development of physical dependence, ethnicity, impulsivity, affective disorder, and peer influences. However, which of these exerts the greatest causal effects is unknown, and their influence no doubt varies across individuals and across development. Once dependence on tobacco smoking is established, evidence suggests that tobacco motivation is strongly influenced by a reduction in withdrawal symptoms, an expectation of stress reduction, and conditioned reinforcement. Nicotine motivation may also be influenced by modulation in stimulus incentive value.",

Many people often make poor decisions about personal health risks even when the risks are substantial, the impact is dramatic, or the effect occurs immediately or in the near future. For example, many people decide to smoke or chew tobacco in spite of the substantial and documented risk of serious health problems caused by tobacco use.

Nicotine is the main psychoactive drug responsible for the addictive nature of tobacco, explaining why many smokers fail to quit without assistance. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation is deemed effective for a broad range of populations and should be routinely offered to smokers interested in making a quit attempt. Varenicline, a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic receptor increases chances of quitting three-fold compared to placebo in smokers without comorbidities, and in smokers with cardiovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Persons with mental illness have high rates of smoking, and the potential impact of varenicline on mental status and the underlying pathophysiology of mental illness, has become a salient concern. Varenicline is an appropriate aid for smoking cessation in patients with medical and/or psychiatric comorbidity. This conclusion is supported by current evidence on the safety and tolerability of the drug.",

In an effort to combat stress, many military personnel report high levels of nicotine use. This study investigated the relationship between tobacco use and perceived stress among military members in all four armed services. Results indicate that those who use tobacco products specifically to reduce stress report significantly higher stress levels than those who do not use tobacco. Moreover, current users and those who both smoked and used smokeless tobacco were far more likely to report experiencing \"a lot\" of stress from a variety of sources than former or never users. Tobacco users also engaged more frequently in negative coping behaviors and relied less on the positive coping strategies used more often by former or never smokers. These findings are consistent with the larger body of literature suggesting that tobacco is not only an ineffective stress-reducing strategy, it also likely perpetuates a stress response in users. It is, therefore, critical that the military improve effective means of coping among nicotine-using troops.",

Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is very similar to amphetamine. The amount prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit disorder has increased and there is evidence that some is diverted and abused. Cocaine is an alkaloid made from the leaves of the coca bush, which grows in the mountain regions of South America.

The scientists have reached a long time ago the conclusion that there exists a biological foundation for the drug dependency. A repeated usage or consumption of some large dosages can represent a serious threat regarding the health state of the individual. Those who abuse a drug are those who not only used it frequently but consider also that they cannot live without it, leading to dependency. This phenomenon regarding the dependency existed during the entire history, yet from the oldest times, people knew also the properties of the drugs, these being used for various purposes, religious, therapeutic, relaxation, etc. In the past, as well as nowadays, the drug was and is considered a substance which can be used in therapy due to some curative properties, but whose effect is sometimes uncertain and deadly for the organism.",

Teenagers smoke 1.1 billion packs of cigarettes yearly and will account for more than $200 billion in future health care costs. Recent behavioral studies confirm nicotine's ability to induce in adolescents both the tolerance and abstinence phenomena typical of other addicting substances. A range of adverse health effects, first detectable in adolescent cigarette smokers, extend into adulthood. Through the effects of environmental smoke or smoking during pregnancy, adolescent smokers affect not only their own health, but that of friends, family members, and even their own fetuses and children. Additional research into effective prevention and smoking cessation programs is urgently needed to forestall the ravaging of yet another generation by this preventable and deadly habit.",

It is estimated that one out of every four Americans has used cocaine and some six million people in the US use it regularly. Although cocaine affects all systems in the body, the central nervous system (CNS) is the primary target. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of neurotransmitters in the neuronal synapses. Almost all CNS effects of cocaine can be attributed to this mechanism. Euphoria, pharmacological pleasure and intense cocaine craving share basis in this system. The effects of cocaine on other organ systems, in addition to its effects on the CNS, account for the majority of the complications associated with cocaine abuse. In this paper, the CNS effects following cocaine administration and their treatment are discussed.",

      "abstract": "As in the rest of the world, marijuana has been one of the most commonly abused psychoactive illicit substances in Turkey. Recent police reports of record amount of marijuana seized and numerous arrests are evidence that the production and consumption of marijuana is on the rise. Lately, a newer and potentially more problematic group of chemicals, so called synthetic marijuana, became available on the streets. Its appearance as an herbal mixture fools the interested crowd that it is a natural, and therefore presumed to be safe, substance that can be used to have a “good time” or seek new experiences. Its cheaper price attracts younger individuals who cannot afford marijuana. Difficulties in detecting it in blood or urine samples make it more attractive to most marijuana users who already have trouble with the legal system. While structurally different, synthetic marijuana compounds bind to the same cannabinoid receptors in the brain and peripheral organs and convey similar pharmacological properties as Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive constituent of marijuana. However, synthetic marijuana is more potent than naturally-occurring THC, causing serious, and at times lethal, outcomes. Due to the imminent hazards to public safety, urgent regulations including criminal, civil and administrative penalties, sanctions and regulatory controls of substances should be imposed on the manufacture, distribution, possession and importation of these synthetic cannabinoids.",

      "abstract": "Although drug use has been found to be acquired in a series of stages or steps, the exact nature of this progression has not been firmly established, nor has such a process been corroborated for life periods other than adolescence. In this study, drug use data obtained from 654 adolescents were used to examine changes and sequencing of drug involvement over an eight-year period from early adolescence to young adulthood. Cannabis use peaked during late adolescence; liquor, stimulants, and nonprescription medication increased steadily over the eight-year period; hypnotics and psychedelic use increased through late adolescence and remained stable through young adulthood; and early experimental use of cigarettes decreased to more committed use over the eight-year span. In a latent variable model that did not include nonprescription drugs and cigarettes, alcohol use significantly influenced later cannabis and hard drug use, whereas cannabis use predicted later hard drug use for the earlier life period. Only the cannabis effect remained at the older age period, when drug use patterns appeared to become more stable and firmly established. However, when cigarettes and nonprescription drugs were added to the model, quite different results emerged. Based on this more comprehensive analysis, it was concluded that: There are several interrelated mini-sequences of drug involvement; cigarettes play a prominent role as a gateway to cannabis and hard drugs; and at higher levels of involvement there is a synergistic or reciprocal effect of increasing involvement. Again, the later developmental period was much more stable with somewhat different patterns of influence.",

      "title": "Behavioural effects of caffeine : the specificity hypothesis",
      "abstract": "This thesis argues that caffeine use offered a survival advantage to our ancestors and\nthat moderate use continues to offer modern humans benefits. Caffeine ingestion,\nthrough the blocking of adenosine receptors, elicits broad elements of the mammalian\nthreat response, specifically from the ‘flight or fight’ and ‘tend and befriend’ repertoires\nof behaviour: in effect, caffeine hijacks elements of the stress response. If the effects of\ncaffeine had been discovered recently, rather than being available to Homo sapiens\nsince Neolithic hunter gatherer times, it is likely that caffeine would be considered a\n‘smart’ drug. More caffeine is being ingested today than ever previously recorded.\nCaffeine use is found across all age groups, all socio-economic strata, most ethnic\ngroups, and is being used increasingly by the medical and pharmaceutical industries and by the armed forces. Yet despite this wide usage and a substantial body of research\nliterature, there is at present no clear pattern or plausible model for the way caffeine\nachieves its effects. There is much contradiction in the literature and ambiguity as to\nwhy caffeine use should improve performance on some tasks, impair it on others and\nhave no effect on other tasks, for some but not all of the time. The present work argues,\nthrough an examination of the specificity of caffeine’s operation, that these effects are\nnot arbitrary but elicited by the nature of the tasks, in particular that caffeine ingestion\naffects those processes and behaviours which improve the probability of survival under\nperceived threat or stress. This is argued through the perspective of evolutionary\npsychology and relies theoretically on Polyvagal Theory. The argument generates\ntestable hypotheses and empirical support for the thesis is garnered from nine\nexperiments on card-sorting, verbal and numerical processing, local and global\ncategorization, field dependence-independence, the Stroop task, tests of visuo-spatial\nability, and from a correlational study of caffeine use and personality traits. It is\nconcluded that moderate caffeine use in healthy adults promotes behaviours likely to be\nadaptive under perceived threat or stress. Limitations of both theory and empirical work\nand are discussed, together with potential practical applications and suggestions for\nfurther work.",

Normally the body might use cytokines to trigger a fever of inflammatory response to battle infection leading to unpleasant effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue and hormonal imbalance in the body. Dehydration is believed to be the cause of hangover as it leads to anti diuresis state in the body. The most compelling theory that, at the moment, is that hangover results from a buildup of acetaldehyde, a toxic compound in the body. The congener amount in the particular alcoholic beverage is believed to be increase the extent of severity of hangover. Methanol, found in highest levels in whiskey and red wine has received a larger amount of blame for showing that it can linger in the body after all alcohol has been eliminated, perhaps accounting for the enduring effects of hangover.",

      "title": "Regulation in the face of uncertainty: the evidence on electronic nicotine delivery systems (e-cigarettes)",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Tobacco smoking is the largest single preventable cause of many chronic diseases and death. Effective treatments exist; however, few smokers use them and most try to quit by themselves. Most of the tobacco cigarette's toxicity is related to the combustion process. Models of harm reduction applied to tobacco suggest that switching from inhalation of combustible products to a noncombustible nicotine delivery product would likely result in a vast reduction in tobacco-related death and illness. Currently available evidence raises no doubt that electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) are by far less harmful than smoking (although probably not absolutely safe) and have the potential to be the most effective tobacco harm reduction products due to their unique property of resembling smoking and providing satisfaction to the user. A lot of controversy is surrounding e-cigs and their regulation, much of which is based on the precautionary principle. Although monitoring and further research is definitely needed, the arguments used to implement severe restrictions or bans are mostly hypothetical, weakly supported by evidence, and, in some cases, derived from mispresentation or misinterpretation of the study findings. Regulators should keep in mind that the target population is smokers who want to reduce or quit their deadly tobacco consumption. To achieve this goal, smokers should be honestly informed on the relative harmfulness of the different products. E-cigs are not tobacco products and are not used as medications. For this reason, a specific regulatory scheme is needed, separate from tobacco or medicinal products regulation. Regulation should implement specific quality criteria for products, rules for the exclusion of chemicals of reasonable concern, and appropriate testing for possible contaminants. Additionally, manufacturing standards derived from the food industry should be implemented and adjusted for specific conditions related to e-cigs. Finding the appropriate balance between safety and acceptability of use by smokers will be important in achieving the maximum public health benefit. Labeling should be specified, with warnings about exposure to skin or through ingestion and discouragement of use by nonsmokers, related to the presence of nicotine. Finally, advertising and marketing should not be banned, but appropriately regulated in order to encourage use by the intended population while avoiding use by never-smokers. E-cigs should be appealing to smokers (but not to nonsmokers), while availability and pricing should be strong competitive advantages of e-cigs relative to tobacco cigarettes.

      "abstract": "Abstract The results of safety studies in animals have been negative. There are very few human cases of cannabis-related death, and these are probably related to other factors. This chapter discusses whether teenage cannabis use leads to subsequent psychotic illness. It also discusses the difficulty of proving cause and effect. Effects of cannabis on motivation and driving are considered. The teenage brain may be especially vulnerable. Tolerance and dependence are real. The special hazards of smoked cannabis are examined, as is whether cannabis is a “gateway drug.” Finally, the chapter discusses whether there any effects persist after cessation of cannabis use.",

These problems often lead to substance use disorders (SUDs). Any substance use can cause problems. The real issues are a person’s reasons for using, and whether that substance use is part of a substance use disorder. Family members often think of the drug as being the problem when it is really the person’s pattern of use and reasons for using that are the problems. Drugs come and go and are replaced by new ones all the time. SUDs and addiction are people problems that involve drugs.",

      "abstract": "'Energy drinks', 'energy shots' and other energy products have exploded in popularity in the past several years; however, their use is not without risk. Caffeine is the main active ingredient in energy drinks, and excessive consumption may acutely cause caffeine intoxication, resulting in tachycardia, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and death. The effects of chronic high-dose caffeine intake in children and adolescents are unknown. Caffeine may raise blood pressure, disrupt adolescent sleep patterns, exacerbate psychiatric disease, cause physiologic dependence, and increase the risk of subsequent addiction. Coingestion of caffeine and ethanol has been associated with increased risk-taking behaviors, harm to adolescent users, impaired driving, and increased use of other illicit substances. The toxicity of ingredients often present in energy drinks, such as taurine, niacin, and pyridoxine, is less well defined. Recent and significant literature describing adverse events associated with energy drink use are reviewed. Although prior studies have examined the effects of caffeine in adolescents, energy drinks should be considered a novel exposure. The high doses of caffeine, often in combination with ingredients with unknown safety profiles, mandates urgent research on the safety of energy drink use in children and adolescents. Regulation of pediatric energy drink use may be a necessary step once the health effects are further characterized.",

      "title": "Social and Psychological Factors Underlying Inhalant Abuse",
      "abstract": "There are three distinct types of inhalant users: young inhalant users, adolescent polydrug users, and inhalant-dependent adults. Young inhalant users have a modal age of 12 to 13. They use inhalants and may also use alcohol and marijuana. They are likely to have more emotional problems than nondrug users or young marijuana users. These problems, particularly when they involve feelings of anger and alienation, increase the chances that they will identify with other youth who have similar feelings. When this happens, young people form peer clusters; they find a best friend or form a small gang that has a high potential for getting involved with drugs. Most of these peer clusters use inhalants only a few times a month, although some may become obsessed with inhalant use to the exclusion of nearly all other activities. The data showing that young inhalant users have more emotional problems than either nondrug users or young marijuana users suggest that treatment should involve therapy as well as drug avoidance approaches. Every youth caught using inhalants, however, should not automatically be sent for therapy. Sometimes a youth caught using a drug is not really drug involved and overreaction can be damaging. In addition, the emotional problems of all young inhalant users are not identical. A higher average level of emotional problems only means that some of the young inhalant users have those problems, not all of them. Older adolescents, including those who used inhalants earlier, are not likely to use inhalants. Since young inhalant users seem to be troubled youth, have shown an early penchant for drug use, and have drug-using associates, it seem unlikely that they quit using drugs. They probably move on to other drugs, leaving inhalants behind. The older adolescents who do use inhalants are adolescent polydrug users, with a modal age of around 15 to 16. They take many different drugs, and some of them use inhalants as well. The adolescents who use inhalants are probably using a wider range of drugs than other adolescents and are probably getting high more often. Furthermore, they are likely to be more deviant and may be involved in more aggression and more crime. Inhalant-dependent adults usually have a long history of alcohol and other drug involvement. At some point, inhalants have become their preferred drug. By that time, they are usually in their midtwenties to early thirties. They have serious problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Background Fetishism is a type of paraphilia. The focus of sexual arousal in fetishism is oriented towards inanimate objects. Sexual arousal and craving are some of the reasons the youth resort to crystal (glass). Drug abuse may cause disorders in sexual function. Case report The patient was a 41 years old man. He married in age 22 years and experienced frequent intercourses with his wife from which he gained pleasure and it was his preferable method. Her wife left ten years ago. The patient started crystal administration through insufflations since seven months ago. Simultaneous with crystal abuse, wearing women's underwear was the only medium through which the patient reached sexual orgasm. Discussion A lot of psychological symptoms related to new substances (for example glass) are new to psychiatrists treating dependency in medical clinics. Fetishism may coexist with addiction as comorbidity. Another point to be mentioned is that, symptoms of fetishism increased and decreased with more and less glass administration, indicating that symptoms of paraphilia emerge as a result of glass use. In addition, prior to glass use, the patient maintained normal sexual tendencies, had experienced sexual intercourse and did not suffer from any type of paraphilia.",

A temptation to try drugs as a result of peer pressureThere were also other factors : For example, the location of houses near places where the buying and selling of drugs is common allowed some offenders to become to try drugs when they were unhappy. Thus it was not easy to refrain. Moreover , these offenders had a low standard of living, and a low level of education. Therefore, they had an urge to try drugs as an escape. After their first use of drugs they felt relaxed by the effects of the drugs. As a result, they become happy, relaxed, and they could work better. This made the drug users want to continue the use. Also, these drug users had a belief that heroin was the most dangerous kind of drug. Thery believed that other kinds of drugs were safer than heroin, and therefore not dangerous . Moreover, those who lived near the offenders did not pay particular attention to drug addiction problems. These factors contributed to the tendency to use drugs continuously. Finally , they became addicted to drugs. It was found that each drug user had tried more than on kind of drug. They usually began with the mildest and changed to the more dangerous ones, At the end almost all became drug dealers themselves.In the Northeast of Thailand the selling And buying of drugs was done in habitation region both in and out of town.",

      "abstract": "Because the main present-day centres of coca chewing are in the high altiplano regions of Peru and Bolivia, it has been widely assumed that the habit evolved primarily as a response to the stresses of life at high altitudes. When archaeological, ethnohistorical, and botanical sources of evidence are considered, a different emphasis emerges. Before the European conquest, coca was chewed everywhere from Nicaragua to Chile and at all altitudes. This pattern goes back to at least 2000 B.C. in coastal Peru and Ecuador and has considerable time-depth elsewhere. Even today, coca taking is linked not primarily with high-altitude life, but with the survival of traditional Indian culture. Apart from its role in indigenous culture, coca is everywhere regarded as a stimulant conferring resistance against hunger, thirst, and fatigue, none of which is specifically a high-altitude problem. Pharmacological data confirm that coca acts as a general stimulant by preventing the removal of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline from its site of action. This action resembles the effect of drugs used in medicine to treat depression and, more distantly, the action of caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee.",

      "abstract": "Although the database is small and not completely consistent, it appears that patients with schizophrenia have high caffeine intakes. The reasons are unclear. In nonhumans, caffeine enhances the effects of dopamine, which might be expected to worsen positive symptoms and improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia and worsen tardive dyskinesia. Eliminating caffeine among patients with schizophrenia does not appear to make them better or worse. Acute intake of large amounts of caffeine may increase psychoses and hostility. However, those who chronically use large amounts of caffeine may develop enough tolerance that these adverse effects do not occur, but whether this conjecture is true has not been tested. Interestingly, persons with schizophrenia do not develop anxiety at high doses of caffeine. Although there was initial concern that caffeine might inactivate liquid doses of neuroleptics, the clinical significance of this concern is unclear. On the other hand, caffeine might increase the level of clozapine, and more research in this area is needed.",

The data on other factors such as use of mobile phone and stress on reproductive health are inadequate and need detailed study.

      "abstract": "Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or e-cigarettes or vape pens/vaping devices are battery-powered devices used to smoke or ‘vape’, a flavoured solution containing varying concentrations of nicotine, an addictive chemical found in cigarettes and other forms of tobacco products. Amongst these various types of ENDS devices, e-cigarettes are the most common type. They produce an aerosolized mixture of the flavoured liquids and nicotine, which is inhaled by the user. Nicotine is considered as one of the most addictive substances. The rapidity at which it is introduced into the body, age of first exposure and the dosage administered all add to determine the potential risk of a person being addicted to it throughout life. Nicotine addiction is established more strongly when the exposure occurs in adolescence. The various flavours and attractive designs also add to the allure of these products to the young population.\r\n\r\nENDS or e-cigarettes are manufactured in such a way to resemble conventional tobacco products such as cigarettes, pipes and cigars and common gadgets such as flash drives, flashlights or pens (Figs. ​(Figs.11 and ​and22)1. Structurally, most e-cigarettes contain four different components: a cartridge or reservoir, which holds a liquid solution containing varying amounts of nicotine with flavourings, and other chemicals (e-liquid or e-juice), namely a power source (usually a battery), a heating element (atomizer) and a mouthpiece that the person uses to inhale. They date back to 17th August 1965 when the first documented patent for this type of device was issued in Pennsylvania. Since then, it took several decades of additional propagation before mass production was initiated in 2003 in China and some other countries. Currently, there are more than 460 different e-cigarette brands with varied configuration of nicotine delivery available in the market, for example, cigar-likes (first generation), tank systems (second generation) and personal vaporizers (third generation) with over 7700 flavours2. This makes collation of data on health effects more difficult for generation of scientific evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen in a separate window\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious types of electronic nicotine delivery systems devices.\r\n\r\nSource: Ref. 1",

      "abstract": "L'utilisation de substances récréatives a pris au cours de ces dernières années des proportions épidémiques tant au niveau mondial qu'au niveau national. Parmi les différentes substances, l'alcool possède une position particulière dans la mesure où contrairement aux autres substances, une consommation modérée peut avoir certains effets bénéfiques. La cocaïne, les amphétamines et l'ecstasy ont toutes pour principal effet cardiovasculaire délétère d'entraîner une stimulation majeure du système sympathique conduisant à différents degrés de tachycardie, et de vasoconstriction dont l'expression clinique dépend tout aussi bien de la dose ingérée, de l'existence d'une pathologie préalable que de l'organe considéré. L'héroïne, à l'inverse, stimule le système parasympathique avec pour conséquence la possibilité de bradycardie et d'hypotension. Quant au cannabis, ses effets cardiovasculaires apparaissent dépendants de la dose ingérée et surtout de phénomène d'accoutumance important. L'ensemble de ces manifestations cardiovasculaires est important à garder à l'esprit, même si le contexte d'intoxication aux substances récréatives n'est pas évident. Over the past years, the trend of recreational drugs abuse is on an epidemic increase worldwide but also in our own country. Among these conditions, alcohol has a specific position because a moderate intake has been proven to be beneficial on the cardiovascular system. In contrast, cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy have major deleterious side-effects (i.e.: tachycardia and vasoconstriction) as a consequence of a stimulation of the sympathetic system; these effects are depending on the amount of drug ingested but also on the existence of associated underlying pathophysiological conditions. Conversely, heroin increases the parasympathetic tone with possible bradycardia and hypotension. Finally, the cardiovascular side-effects of cannabis are not only dose-dependent but also related to the degree of addiction. All these symptoms should be kept in mind even when the context of recreational drugs abuse is not obvious.",

      "title": "Life before birth: are the dice tossed for the rest of our lives?",
      "abstract": "Without any exception, every human being has spent at least a considerable amount of time in the womb and has gone through the stressful process of being born. However, the quantity and quality of our life before birth varies tremendously between people. That is, some individuals survive birth after only 22 weeks of pregnancy [1] and others have the luxury of being born after spending more than 40 weeks in utero. Perhaps more importantly than the duration are the conditions of our stay: Do we receive enough and healthy nutrition? Are we exposed to toxics like tobacco, alcohol or drugs? Is the oxygen supply sufficient? Are we being subjected to high levels of stress hormones? Are we getting infected by bacteria or viruses? And then…birth. By some considered as the most stressful life event we will ever have to endure. A certain amount of stress is actually necessary for survival: The high level of hormones released during birth, which are also involved in the stress response, are believed to make the newborn more alert promoting the bonding process and, by extension, the child’s physical survival [2]. However, while a certain amount of stress is necessary for survival, extreme and/or prolonged stress can affect health adversely [3]. For example, it has been shown that people who had underwent an extremely stressful birth (defined as vaginal delivery with fetal suffering or forceps use, urgent cesarean section indicated by fetal suffering or twin birth with death of the other fetus) were 5 times more likely to have developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in the year following a stressful life event compared to OCD patients without an extremely stressful birth [4]. In other words, the former group had more often a stress-event-related onset of OCD compared to the latter group, indexing the possibility that a very stressful birth creates a life-long enhanced vulnerability to stress and an enhanced risk of developing anxiety related symptoms, such as OCD. Animal studies also suggest that a single aversive life event may be capable of permanently affecting the individual’s sensitivity towards experiences in life after birth [5].\r\n\r\nThe importance of a prosperous prenatal environment and birth process for future health has long been recognized. Conversely, exposure to early adversity during a sensitive period of development is thought to lead to structural, physiological and metabolic changes in the fetus that increase susceptibility to later disease [6]. For instance, antenatal maternal and infant malnutrition [7, 8], antenatal maternal stress [9], low birth weight, younger maternal age and increasing birth order [10–13] have all, amongst others, been linked to poorer mental health. Particularly in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the role of adverse prenatal and perinatal factors is well-documented. Compelling evidence exists for associations between an increased risk for ASD on the one hand and maternal infections during pregnancy, increased parental age, fetal hypoxia, prematurity, and low birth weight on the other hand [14–16]. More broadly viewed, as reported by Guedeney et al. in this issue and previously by others [17–19], associations have been found between pre- and perinatal risks and sustained social withdrawal behavior (more prevalent than ASD but considered a red flag for developing clinical disorders such as ASD, attachment disorders and depression) [20–22]. In any case, life before birth is related to mental health outcomes in life after birth.\r\n\r\nHowever, it remains to be determined to what extent these factors are true risk mediators (causally involved) or rather risk indicators (linked to an increased risk but not contributing causally to the adverse outcome). Two main reasons why prenatal risks may act as risk indicators, are that these factors are associated with postnatal risks (such as social adversity and parent mental health problems) and that they relate to unmeasured confounders, such as maternally transmitted inherited factors [6]. Studies commonly deal with these two possibilities by adjusting for measured confounders. For instance, it was recently shown that when social class, family structure and religion were corrected for, prenatal circumstances were not or only marginally associated with mental health outcomes in adolescence and young adulthood [23]. Further support for the hypothesis that perinatal factors may often act as indicators instead of mediators of poor mental health was reported in a series of elegantly designed studies by Thapar and colleagues [24–26]. Using genetically informative designs, in which mothers were either genetically related or unrelated to their child as a result of assisted reproductive technologies, they showed that relationships between smoking during pregnancy and ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms, and also between breastfeeding and lower levels of conduct problems, were only present in the genetically related group and not in the genetically unrelated group [24–26]. These studies teased apart the intrauterine and genetic influences normally intertwined in explaining the fetal origins of chronic diseases and suggest pre- and perinatal risk factors may sometimes act as a proxy for the underlying genetic risk transmitted to offspring.\r\n\r\nHowever, elegant as these studies may be in examining the role of prenatal risks in isolation from a genetic background, the reality of life is that the vast majority of people are conceived in the natural way and spend their life before and after birth with their biological parents. Therefore, genetic and environmental factors correlate and interact in various complex ways, causing substantial differences between people in their exposure and susceptibility to both positive and negative environmental influences [27, 28]. This differential susceptibility may be labeled as “prenatal programming of postnatal plasticity” [29] and one of the mechanisms underlying this may be epigenetics. Epigenetics can be broadly defined as those heritable changes not dependant on the genomic sequence and encompasses a variety of mechanisms to dynamically modify the expression of the genome [30]. There appear to be “discrete epigenetic checkpoints” [30] during which the genome is extra sensitive to modifications by environmental factors. This illustrates that in real life there is no effect of prenatal risk in isolation from a genetic background or vice versa.\r\n\r\nSo, in life before birth, are the dice tossed for the rest of our lives? The influence of the prenatal environment on mental health later in life is unequivocally present. Often the dice are unfairly being tossed, with some children receiving the best of odds and others the worst. However, what the best odds are is not predetermined, but may vary according to the environment in which the child grows up. In some cases, the last shall be the first.",

The patient is not aware that the tonic and his state of health are connected and as a result increases the dose of the tonic hoping for a remission of symptoms. This results in a worsening of the condition and admission to hospital. The arsenic levels in hair from such cases are much higher than normal and similar to those found in chronic arsenic poisoning from other sources. The symptoms are relatively mild and appear at arsenic levels significantly greater than those found in acute non-fatal poisoning where severe symptoms are reported. This gives support to the development of arsenic tolerance following long-term ingestion of small amounts.",

Recent clinical and preclinical investigations demonstrate that cocaine produces unique abuse and withdrawal patterns that differ from those of other major abused drugs and suggest that long-term cocaine abuse produces neurophysiological alterations in specific systems in the central nervous system that regulate the capacity to experience pleasure. It will be necessary to develop clinically pertinent research models before these findings can be considered definitive, but these evolving ideas have already led to applications of promising experimental treatments for cocaine abuse.",

      "abstract": "According to the European Drug and Drug Addiction Observatory, after Cannabis, Cocaine is the most widely used illegal drug in Europe. Awareness of the damage caused by consuming this substance is clear in some areas, while in others it may be ignored, underestimated or poorly dimensioned. The information systems that do exist almost certainly underestimate the number of deaths connected with cocaine. Apart from the potential the drug has to cause direct damage to different organs of the body, its consumption can lead to serious problems arising from other circumstances that are not always connected with this drug, including murders, traffic accidents and accidents at work, infectious diseases related to high-risk behaviour, and suicides. Cocaine is increasingly present in cases of violence such as fights or aggression, in many cases accompanied by the use of knives and firearms. Serious behavioural disorders are being seen more and more frequently in the healthcare services, and in clinics we are witnessing a worrying increase on a day-to-day basis of conflictive episodes associated with the use of cocaine amongst our patients. This damage does not only affect a marginal population, but instead all levels of society, and often goes unnoticed or unreported. Coordination between different institutions and healthcare areas is essential in order to obtain this information, and in this way to provide a more precise picture of the consequences of Cocaine consumption, as today we are still far from having quantified its true dimension.",

      "title": "SMOKING CESSATION – WHAT’S NEW?",
      "abstract": "Tobacco cessation represents a multifaceted approach involving patients who often don't neatly fit into classic prototypes.Researchers found that current smokers experience a more than 10-year reduction in life expectancy compared to non-smokers, and more than half make an attempt each year, but less than 10% manage to stay smoke-free for at least 6 months.Therefore, it's recommended to employ a combination of methods and strategies, ranging from questionnaires to established medications.The role of the medical staff is and remains vital in this context.Nicotine is a potent drug due to its rapid absorption and swift diffusion into the central nervous system, and quitting nicotine leads to important consequences, such as craving, drug-seeking behaviour and withdrawal symptoms.Negative affective states also emerge, characterized by symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.Hierarchical multiple regression models have revealed that extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness and age are among the predictors of daily cigarette consumption.The authors discuss both traditional and innovative opportunities to expedite this process, while analysing the potential to enhance the compliance of healthcare providers and patients.Smoking cessation, the process of quitting smoking, can be approached through both pharmacological (medication-based) and non-pharmacological (behavioural and supportive) methods.The choice of approach or combination of approaches depends on individual preferences and needs. RezumatRenunțarea la fumat reprezintă o abordare complexă a unui pacient care adesea nu se încadrează în prototipurile clasice.Cercetările au evidențiat că fumătorii se confruntă cu o reducere de peste 10 ani a speranței de viață în comparație cu nefumătorii și mai mult de jumătate fac o încercare de a renunța în fiecare an, dar mai puțin de 10% reușesc să rămână abstinenți cel puțin 6 luni.Prin urmare, se recomandă utilizarea unei combinații de metode și strategii, de la chestionare la medicamente deja stabilite, iar rolul personalului medical este și rămâne vital în acest context.Nicotina este un drog puternic datorită absorbției și difuzării rapide în sistemul nervos central, iar renunțarea conduce la efecte secundare importante, precum dorința arzătoare, comportamentul de căutare a drogului și simptomele de sevraj.Apar și stări afective negative, caracterizate prin simptome precum depresie, anxietate, iritabilitate și insomnie.Modelele ierarhice de regresie multiplă au dezvăluit că extraversia, nevroticismul, conștiinciozitatea și vârsta se numără printre predictorii consumului zilnic de țigări.Autorii discută oportunități vechi și noi de a accelera acest proces analizând posibilitatea de a îmbunătăți complianța furnizorilor de servicii medicale și a pacienților.Procesul de renunțare la fumat, poate fi abordat atât prin metode farmacologice, cât și prin metode comportamentale și de susținere.Alegerea abordării sau combinația de abordări depinde de preferințele și nevoile individuale.",

      "abstract": "and hydrogen cyanide) and numerous polycyclic hydrocarbons, at least one of which is a known carcinogen Why so many of us get pleasure from partaking of such a mixture is something of a mystery. The chemical analysis of tobacco smoke, while suggestive, does not in itself prove anything about the long-term effects of smoking. Some chemicals which are highly toxic in large doses are harmless or even beneficial in small doses. Other substances may be practically harmless in a single large dose but cause serious damage after pro longed exposure to relatively small doses. Furthermore, there are some factors which seem to have little or no effect on healthy individuals but which have deleterious effects on patients suffering from certain diseases. As scientists, I think we would all agree that the ideal way to determine the long-term effects of smoking would be to set up a well-controlled experiment on human beings. It should start when the subjects are in their teens and continue until the last one dies of old age. Unfortunately, this is a bit impractical for numerous reasons. For example, it would be quite impossible for the investigator to maintain the same degree of control over human subjects as over laboratory animals. For these reasons, many studies have been made to ascertain what happens to people who of their own volition have smoked for many years. Perhaps the least satisfactory has been the study of time trend associations. As shown on Figure 1, a tremendous increase has occurred in the reported death rate from lung cancer. In this country, the age standardized rate for white males rose from about 0.7 per 100,000 in 1914 to 28.4 per 100,000 in 1956. This led to the hypothesis that a corresponding increase must have occurred in one or more factors responsible for lung cancer, probably some substance inhaled into the lungs. Concurrently, a decrease occurred in three other lung diseases: tuberculosis, influenza, and pneumonia. Coal soot, dust from asphalt highways, motor vehicle exhaust fumes, fumes from fuel oil, and cigarette smoke have been suspect in relation",

Many people often make poor decisions about personal health risks even when the risks are substantial, the impact is dramatic, or the effect occurs immediately or in the near future. For example, many people decide to smoke or chew tobacco in spite of the substantial and documented risk of serious health problems caused by tobacco use.

      "abstract": "adulterants, substance use disorder, opioids: Drug users may not get what they bargained for when buying pills, powder, or other forms of drugs from a street dealer. Contaminants and adulterants are found in the vast majority of drugs bought on the street, and cocaine, heroin, and other opioids are rarely pure drugs. Even pharmaceutical-grade pills are often bogus, even if packaged to appear to be from a legitimate source. Illicitly manufactured drugs commonly contain additional pharmacologically active components used to increase the bulk of the product, simulate a street drug's effects, or to enhance the potency of the primary product. There are no controls or quality measurers used in these adulterants, they can be chemicals or products from around the home or garage, and the additives themselves can be toxic.FigurePrescription opioids account for about a third of all deaths from opioid use, and they sometimes have numerous adulterants that are doled out to unsuspecting users. Pure cocaine and heroin are rarely available on the street these days, with many additives and contaminants used to increase the amount of the substance sold and to produce symptoms similar to those of the pure drug. Likewise, unadulterated opioids are rarely available to drug users, and it is quite amazing how many nonopioid contaminants can be found in these substances. The number of overdose deaths increased from 23,500 in 2002 to 70,200 in 2017, and opioid deaths increased fourfold, from 11,900 in 2002 to 47,600 in 2017. (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2018;67[5152]:1419; https://bit.ly/3eiTdOK; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. December 2018.) Many of these deaths were related to the user unknowingly using adulterated or tainted street drugs. The Emerging Role of Toxic Adulterants in Street Drugs in the U.S. Illicit Opioid Crisis Singh VM, Browne T, Montgomery J Public Health Rep. 2020;135(1):6 https://bit.ly/2SR0Zbn The rate of opioid overdose deaths rose from 42,000 in 2016 to 47,600 in 2017, a 13 percent increase in just one year. Deaths from cocaine and the number of overdose deaths related to prescription opioids, however, have remained relatively constant. A total of 28,400 of the estimated 38,000 opioid deaths in 2018 involved non-methadone synthetic opioids; the most common was illicitly manufactured fentanyl. Fentanyl as an adulterant was largely responsible for the increased number of deaths, but the presence and danger of multiple toxic adulterants are also important issues in opioid-related deaths. Importantly, the number of deaths from prescription opioids was and still is declining. About 60 percent of opioid-related deaths now are due to non-methadone synthetic opioid adulterants. This is a marked 45 percent increase from the previous year, highlighting the fact that manufactured opioids have become the main driver of the nation's opioid crisis. Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are produced in clandestine laboratories rather than commercial pharmaceutical laboratories. Synthetic opioids have been detected in about 60 percent of opioid-related deaths. Ninety percent of those who died from opioids in Florida had nonopioid toxic components in their system at autopsy. Illicit fentanyl is clearly complicating and amplifying the death rate from opioids. It is sold on the street as a powder and mixed with heroin and other less potent opioids. Fentanyl and other added lethal adulterants often go undetected and unreported because current toxicology laboratories are unable to identify them. Suspected but unidentified adulterants can lead to renal and liver problems, blood disorders, infectious diseases, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest. An additional pharmacologically active substance was found in 97 percent of street drug samples in Vermont and in 89 percent of those in Kentucky. As many as nine additional components were identified in these samples. It would not be uncommon to find as many as 11 additional components in the systems of those who died of drug overdose at autopsy. Obviously, failure to recognize or identify toxic adulterants will hinder timely and appropriate treatment and could even interfere with life-saving measures. The presence of multiple pharmacologically active components in street drugs is simply amazing. The table demonstrates the amazing number of components found in street drugs seized as cocaine in Kentucky and Vermont in 2017. Determination of Cutting Agents in Seized Cocaine Sample Using GC-MS, GC-TMS and LC-MS/MS Fiorentin TR, Fogarty M, et al. Forensic Sci Int. 2019;295:199 The authors of this study attempted to quantify cocaine and cutting agents in 116 samples of cocaine using sophisticated laboratory methods. The analysis was done at the NMS Laboratories in Willow Grove, PA, probably the most advanced toxicology laboratory in the country. NMS uses gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and other state-of-the-art tests not generally available to clinicians. The testing was done specifically to evaluate for cocaine, levamisole, benzocaine, phenacetin hydroxyzine, theophylline, acetaminophen, and caffeine. Cocaine was the only compound in only 17 percent of samples billed as cocaine. The most common cutting drug was levamisole, found in 80 percent of all samples. The percentage of levamisole in the samples was occasionally as high as 75 percent. This is one of many articles showing that street drugs are nowhere near what is advertised. Many agents are added to give a CNS effect or produce an effect that the user would identify as that of the sought-after illicit compound. Complications from adulterants can be significant. Cardiac arrest and other cardiac complications have been well described from quinine and quinidine used to cut heroin sold to IV drug users. (J Gen Intern Med 2012;27[12]:1722; https://bit.ly/3r9fNi2.) Levamisole has increasingly been found in street cocaine as an adulterant (Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2010;88[3]:408), and this may have led to the withdrawal of the drug from the U.S. market. Levamisole was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an immunomodulator, a chemotherapy adjuvant, and an anthelmintic medication. Toxicology laboratories will not routinely assay for levamisole. The purpose of adulterating street cocaine with levamisole is not known. It has been speculated that it is added to potentiate the effects of cocaine. There have also been reports of the metabolism of levamisole to aminorex in racehorses. Aminorex and related compounds, specifically 4-methylaminorex, or “ice,” have high abuse potential because of their amphetamine-like pharmacological activity, but the intended role of levamisole in street cocaine remains unclear. Cardiac Complications of Unwitting Co-injection of Quinine/Quinidine with Heroin in an IV Drug User Phillips KA, Hirsch GA, et al. J Gen Intern Med. 2012;27(12):1722 https://bit.ly/3r9fNi2 This article emphasizes the omnipresence of unusual products used to cut street drugs and some of the bizarre complications encountered by the unwary drug user. Clinicians in an ideal world would be able to quickly identify contaminants and be equipped to deal with the accompanying complications, but this is clearly not possible given the many adulterants used by drug dealers. The clinicians in this case identified the presence of quinine/quinidine in a street drug sold as heroin. The purity of heroin sold in Baltimore in 2019 ranged from an amazingly low zero to 36 percent, according to the Baltimore office of the DEA. Adulterants included acetaminophen, caffeine, diphenhydramine, methorphan, alprazolam, quetiapine, chloroquine, diltiazem, cocaine, procaine, lidocaine, quinine/quinidine, phenacetin, and thiamine. The authors reported the case of an asymptomatic 31-year-old man participating in a drug research study who was found to have an accelerated atrioventricular junctional rhythm on an ECG performed before the study. This patient had a complicated medical history, including IV heroin dependence, hepatitis C, and tobacco dependence. He was taking methadone (100 mg/day) but had no symptoms on initial evaluation. His vital signs and initial laboratory tests were normal, and a drug screen was positive for methadone. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed minimal abnormalities, including an ejection fraction of 50%-55%, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and trace pulmonary and mitral regurgitation. The most common cause of accelerated junctional rhythm is digitalis toxicity, but it can be caused by a number of other medications and conditions. A GC/MS analysis of the patient's urine identified codeine/morphine, methadone, acetaminophen, and quinine/quinidine. Methadone is associated with bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, faintness, and syncope. Note that a urine GM/MS toxicology test cannot differentiate between quinidine and quinine, but that differentiation is not clinically required for the emergency physician. The accelerated atrioventricular junctional rhythm reported in this case has not been associated with methadone. Quinine/quinidine was the second most common adulterant in heroin in Baltimore and was found in 64 percent of samples in 2009-1010. Quinine/quinidine as an adulterant produces a bitter heroin-like taste, and the hypotensive rush produced can mimic a heroin rush. Both characteristics are used by drug buyers to identify heroin on the street by tasting a small drug sample, an activity often seen on TV shows. An amazing number of adulterants have been found in street drug samples throughout the country. Levamisole was found in 62 percent of cocaine-positive urine samples in 2009. Why levamisole would be used as a cutting agent for cocaine is confusing. It can cause agranulocytosis, ear lobe necrosis, and laboratory findings of antiphospholipid syndrome. (Find additional discussion about the toxicology of levamisole in EMN. 2019;41[10]:16; http://bit.ly/2osdXN6 and EMN. 2014;36[5]:1; https://bit.ly/3B59FfB.) - Common Adulterants and Contaminants in Opioids and Cocaine Street Samples Acetaminophen Quetiapine Aminopyrine Cocaine Diltiazem Heroin Diphenhydramine Papaverine Dipyrone Acetyl codeine Levamisole Noscapine Phenacetin Tramadol Caffeine Ketamine Quinine Lidocaine Phenacetin Fentanyl Eighty-three percent of street drug samples collected in Vermont contained five or more components, and 15 percent contained nine or more. Eighty-nine percent of samples collected in Kentucky contained one additional pharmacologically active component, and 32 percent had five or more additional components.Source: Public Health Rep. 2020;135(1):6; https://bit.ly/2SR0Zbn. No significant clinical complications were noted, and this patient did not stop using heroin, but he did decrease his use. An ECG repeated three days later showed sinus bradycardia with a period of atrioventricular dissociation plus slight junctional acceleration, which occurred at a slower rate than in earlier ECGs. A cardiologist confirmed that this change reflected an improvement in the rate and rhythm. The patient's decreased heroin use presumably resulted in decreased unwitting co-injection of quinine/quinidine, accompanied by a dose-related improvement in ECG parameters. This case illustrated an accelerated junctional rhythm that may have resulted from a drug or drugs unwittingly injected during intravenous heroin use. Drug adulterants may produce arrhythmias or other medical complications, as well as toxicity from unsuspected drug-drug interactions. Quinidine alone has more than 135 major interactions. (See common ones in the table.) When treating patients who use illicit drugs, physicians should look beyond the known drugs of abuse for adulterants and diluents to determine possible etiologies of cardiac and other medical complications. Clinicians should also be aware that standard urine toxicology tests do not detect diluents and adulterants, and that tests such as a urine GC/MS should be performed if the clinical picture warrants it. Obviously, given the tremendous number of adulterants and substitutions found in street drugs, it is impossible for the clinician to identify all such interventions to street drugs. It seems like few street drugs are exactly as advertised, and clandestine activities by drug dealers will only increase. Exactly how far the clinician should go in pursuing these issues is a puzzle.

These risks are highlighted in this case of a 38-year-old woman with a history of major depressive disorder and opioid use disorder who switched from Suboxone to kratom and became addicted, eventually consuming large quantities per day. Amplified by other stressors, she reached a breaking point and overdosed on her regular medications for depression. At the psychiatric hospital, she exhibited classic kratom withdrawal symptoms, including vague abdominal pain and restlessness.

Two hundred sixty-six young males, some of whom were marihuana smokers, and some of whom used other drugs also, were interviewed about their levels of achievement and drug use. It was found that lowered levels of achievement were associated with higher rates of drug experience for both marihuana and other psychedelic drugs. Goal setting varied as a function of the decision to use drugs or not, rather than amount of drugs used. These two findings, taken together, suggest that observed lowered achievement is not the result primarily of a change in values, but of perhaps several factors which are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the foremost cause of death in the United States and is a major health problem worldwide. Clearly, the best way to eliminate the risk of smoking-related diseases, is to quit smoking. Smoking cessation has immediate and long-term benefits and substantially reduces the risk of many smoking-related diseases. Unfortunately, quitting smoking is rarely easy. For those smokers who cannot or do not wish to quit, reduction in their total smoking may represent a potential health benefit. Reduction in total smoking can, theoretically, be achieved by: 1) reducing the number of cigarettes smoked daily; and/or 2) switching to a low tar/low nicotine cigarette. Smokers, however, tend to self-adjust nicotine to maintain relatively constant levels. Reduction in tar/nicotine content or number of cigarettes, therefore, may not produce health benefits. Smoking reduction with alternative nicotine delivery, however, may represent an alternative option for smokers who cannot, or do not, wish to quit.",

What is more shocking is the fact that people from virtually all walks of life have been found to indulge in drug use, which was once thought to be limited to those involved with entertainment establishments. It is particularly ominous that a rising number of teenagers are using drugs. Young people often know more about drugs than do their parents and teachers and the teenager who doesn`t know where he can find illegal drugs is a rarity. Today many young people experiment with drugs. Drug use is a health hazard with particular relevance to young people. Adolescent psychoses occur in association with drug-taking. Persistent drug use may block development. It may promote extremely dangerous behaviour; it is associated with suicide attempts and fatal or debilitating accidents through the power of drugs to alter perception and psychometer reactions. As with alcohol abuse, the drug user is likely to fail in many ways, at school, in relationships, and at work. Many young people have turned to crime and prostitution to maintain their supply of drugs. The author suggests various preventive strategies for adolescent drug abuse in relation with the law on protection for youth in Korea. The preventive strategies should cover national survey an youth drug abuse, drug education for students, treatment and rehabilitation for drug users, and drug abuse related laws and regulations.",

There exists a feeling of physical beatitude and exquisite pleasure. One seems to be in an atmosphere of new life where worries are unknown and all is a delightful calm. M. Montegazza, who had experimented with himself by administering a considerable quantity of the drug, exclaimed to his friends when sufficiently recovered that \"God was unjust in that he made man to live without eating coca.\" \"I prefer a life of ten years of coca to one of one thousand years without it.\" The brain and muscular system are extraordinarily stimulated, and one may accomplish tests of physical endurance which under ordinary conditions would be impossible.

      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely consumed central nervous system stimulant in the world, yet little is known about its effects on aggressive behavior. Individuals often consume caffeine to increase energy and ward off mental depletion. Because mental depletion increases aggression when people are provoked, caffeine might reduce aggression by ameliorating the negative effects of depletion. In 2 experiments, participants consumed a 200-mg caffeine tablet or a placebo, were mentally depleted or not, and then provoked and given the opportunity to retaliate with a blast of white noise. Results showed that consuming a placebo reduced aggression relative to both caffeine (Experiments 1 and 2) and a no-pill control condition (Experiment 2). These data suggest that expectancies about the effects of caffeine in the absence of the pharmacological effects of the drug can reduce aggression when mentally depleted.",

      "title": "PREVALÊNCIA DE UTILIZAÇÃO DO ÁLCOOL NA ADOLESCÊNCIA E EFEITOS TOXICOLÓGICOS DE SEU ABUSO",
      "abstract": "Introducao: O uso de alcool entre adolescentes e, naturalmente, um tema controverso no meio social e academico brasileiro. Ao mesmo tempo em que a lei brasileira define como proibida a venda de bebidas alcoolicas para menores de 18 anos, e pratica comum o consumo de alcool pelos jovens, seja no ambiente domiciliar, em festividades, ou mesmo em ambientes publicos. Aqueles que sao coniventes com esse comportamento devem se conscientizar de que as consequencias negativas ligadas ao uso do alcool podem ter grande impacto na vida desses adolescentes, como um pior rendimento nos estudos, problemas sociais, pratica de sexo sem protecao e/ou sem consentimento, maior risco de suicidio ou homicidio, e acidentes relacionados ao consumo. Os adolescentes do sexo masculinos mais velhos, que vivem em areas urbanas, foram os mais propensos a apresentar doencas relacionadas ao alcool e ao fumo.  Alem disso, as principais razoes para o uso pesado/frequente de alcool sao o prazer, diversao e ansiedade. Quanto a depressao, relata-se que quase um terco dos participantes informou ter sofrido desse mal, alem de serem duas vezes mais propensos a ter transtornos relacionados ao uso do alcool. A sociedade como um todo adota atitudes paradoxais frente ao tema: por um lado condena o abuso de alcool pelos jovens, mas e tipicamente permissiva ao estimulo do consumo por meio da propaganda. Objetivo: Este estudo objetivou descrever a prevalencia do consumo de alcool entre adolescentes, bem como ressaltar os impactos sociais do entre jovens e evidenciar os efeitos toxicos do mesmo. Metodologia: Atraves de um levantamento de revisao sistematica bibliografica foram pesquisados os bancos de dados Google Academico e Scielo sendo utilizados os termos chaves: alcoolismo na adolescencia,alcool e jovens. Foram utilizados como limites artigos publicados desde o ano 2010 e no idioma portugues. A busca bibliografica resultou em cinco artigos que representaram o tema. Resultados : A populacao de adolescentes dos estudos esteve compreendia com idades entre 10-20 anos de idade. A acao do alcool no organismo inclui a degeneracao das celulas cerebrais, o aumento da pressao arterial e dos batimentos cardiacos, alem do aparecimento de ulceras e cirrose como condicoes de toxicidade em longo prazo. Desta forma entende-se pertinente o estudo da epidemiologia do uso do alcool por adolescentes, desvendando sua influencia sobre a saude dos jovens, o impacto emocional e social deste vicio e as formas de consumo nos dias atuais, bem como os fatores da sociedade contemporânea que influenciam este uso. C onclusao: O consumo de alcool por adolescentes ainda tem elementos controversos para sua compreensao. Apesar de trazer claras consequencias orgânicas, comportamentais e na estrutura de desenvolvimento da personalidade do jovem o uso do alcool por adolescentes e uma realidade em distintos contextos sociais. Alem da necessidade de se preencher a atual lacuna no setor da saude e bem-estar social para adolescentes, sao necessarias acoes voltadas para o ambiente familiar e potenciais fatores de protecao e de risco que envolve os habitos dos pais.",

Dopamine is not only a key regulator of learning and motivation, but also a core substance that regulates the human body. Depression and Parkinson's disease are often associated with a lack of dopamine. Moreover, smoking is addictive, and its main mechanism is also closely related to dopamine: nicotine can cause a burst of dopamine neurons. Another substance with similar effects to dopamine is endorphins. Endorphins attach to morphine receptors and cause the same pain alleviation and pleasure that morphine and other opiates do, similar to a sense of accomplishment. Endorphins bring pleasure, but also lead to drug abuse. Opiate addiction is a severe public health issue that affects a huge proportion of population. People who take drugs produce dopamine and endorphins, and their mental dependence on drugs far exceeds the benefits of dopamine and endorphins.",

High anger students more frequently drank alcohol, got drunk more often, and experienced more frequent and severe physical, emotional, and behavioral alcohol-related consequences than low anger students. High anger males also were more likely to feel very angry, feel like hurting someone, and do physical damage to others and to property. Whereas, high anger females reported more severe relationship consequences. When Heavy alcohol consumption by high anger students was statistically controlled, anger still contributed variance to alcohol consequences. Results were discussed in terms of understanding, preventing, and treatign alcohol problems.",

      "abstract": "Risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD) is more common in late adolescence and early adulthood (approximately between the ages of 16 and 30) than in any other period in life. This is also the age when young people in Switzerland and many other European countries are legally allowed to buy and drink alcohol, but they usually do not yet have adult responsibilities. This paper reviews evidence from the international literature and provides examples of studies conducted in Switzerland demonstrating that (a) RSOD is by far most prevalent on Saturday evenings followed by Friday evenings, usually because young people go out and do not have any work or study responsibilities the next day; (b) RSOD results from drinking in private before going out (\"predrinking\") and accelerating the pace of drinking (i.e. increasing the number of drinks consumed per hour); (c) RSOD is often not accidental but purposeful,. to seek excitement, to have fun and to feel the effects of alcohol; (d) RSOD occurs predominantly outside the home, mostly in bars, pubs, discos or at special events and festivals; (e) RSOD often results in intended and unintended injuries and other acute consequences, which are leading risk factors for mortality and morbidity in this age group. Effective prevention strategies should include attempts to reduce opportunities to engage in heavy drinking as well as strategies to reduce its harmful consequences.",

Meanwhile, tolerance refers to a drug losing its potency to induce an effect at a familiar dose. As a person regularly uses an addictive drug, they could shift between seeking positive to negative reinforcements. The chapter then highlights the presence of harm in addiction.",

      "title": "A prática do mindfulness em grupo para dependentes de crack internados",
      "abstract": "O crack e uma droga derivada da cocaina, um estimulante do sistema nervoso central, que pode ser injetada ou aspirada, ou ainda convertida na sua forma alcalina, a pasta basica ou crack. Com alto potencial dependogeno, o crack produz complicacoes decorrentes do seu uso, que vao desde o calor e rubor, tremores incontrolaveis, desmaios e convulsoes, ate a overdose, problemas cardiovasculares, respiratorios, promiscuidade sexual, suicidios, homicidios e quadros psiquiatricos. O primeiro relato de consumo de crack no Brasil ocorreu na cidade de Sao Paulo, no ano de 1989. Nos ultimos 20 anos se pode observar um crescimento significativo do consumo de crack em todo o Brasil, e atualmente, os casos de dependencia ja sao responsaveis por 70% das internacoes por cocaina. Por ser uma droga relativamente nova, o conhecimento que se tem a respeito do seu tratamento ainda e escasso, o que tem feito com que as politicas publicas de prevencao e tratamento sejam ainda insuficientes. Entre os maiores desafios que os servicos de saude tem enfrentado no tratamento de dependentes de crack estao a fissura e os sintomas de ansiedade. O craving ou fissura e um desejo intenso de utilizar uma determinada substância, e esta entre os principais motivos que levam os dependentes de substâncias psicoativas como o crack a recairem e abandonarem a terapia. O transtorno ansioso, que tem como principais sintomas a inquietacao motora, sudorese, taquicardia, angustia, e mal estar generalizado, e outro problema relacionado ao uso abusivo de drogas. Isto porque os ansiosos tendem a buscar alivio para a ansiedade em drogas como a maconha, crack, opio e morfina. O que se tem preconizado como tratamento mais eficaz para os dependentes de crack e o uso concomitante de medicacao e terapia cognitiva ou comportamental. Dentre as tecnicas utilizadas pelas terapias cognitivas e comportamentais para o manejo da fissura e da ansiedade esta a pratica de mindfulness. O termo mindfulness refere-se a uma consciencia sincera, de momento a momento, nao julgadora. Com suas raizes em tradicoes como o budismo, yoga e taoismo, ela consiste na atencao, no momento presente, a todos os eventos internos ou externos, sem qualquer julgamento ou resistencia. Tendo como objetivos o aumento da aceitacao e a diminuicao da evitacao das experiencias internas, sua pratica pode ser resumida como a percepcao sem julgamentos de sensacoes corporais, pensamentos, emocoes, imagens, sons, cheiros e gostos. Ha praticas formais de mindfulness como a meditacao, o yoga, o chi kung e o tai chi chuang, e outras nao formais, que consistem na atencao plena em qualquer atividade cotidiana como comer, caminhar, lavar louca, ou outra. Apesar de estar ligado a diversas tradicoes religiosas, o mindfulness vem sendo praticado tambem fora do contexto religioso, tendo como principal beneficio desta dissociacao a democratizacao da sua pratica. Na decada de 1970, na Stress Reduction Clinic, se comecou a utilizar a pratica de mindfulness em programas de reducao do estresse. Apos os resultados positivos observados nestes programas, diversos terapeutas cognitivos e comportamentais vem tambem estudando e adotando este modelo de intervencao. A rapida absorcao desta tecnica por parte dos terapeutas cognitivos e comportamentais pode ser explicada pelo fato da nocao do mindfulness estar ja anteriormente e de forma implicita presente nas praticas clinicas tradicionais das terapias cognitivas e comportamentais. Na considerada terceira onda das terapias comportamentais ha diversas abordagens que adotaram a tecnica mindfulness, destacando-se a terapia de aceitacao e compromisso (ACT); a terapia comportamental dialetica (TCD); a terapia cognitivo-comportamental baseada na aceitacao (TCBA); e a terapia cognitivo-comportamental baseada em mindfulness e aceitacao. Atualmente se vem utilizando a pratica de mindfulness nao somente nos programas de reducao do estresse, mas tambem no tratamento de outras patologias como o Transtorno de Ansiedade Generalizada, Transtorno de Pânico, dores cronicas, depressao, e como prevencao da recaida com dependentes quimicos. O objetivo deste trabalho e apresentar a experiencia da realizacao de um grupo de mindfulness para dependentes de crack internados em uma unidade especializada para dependencia quimica. O grupo de mindfulness e realizado com frequencia semanal com duracao de 30 minutos e sao convidados a participar todos os pacientes dependentes de crack que estejam entre 5 e 15 dias em abstinencia, que nao apresentem sintomas psicoticos e que tenham condicoes fisicas e cognitivas para participar desta intervencao. Participam de 5 a 10 pacientes, do sexo masculino, entre 18 e 65 anos de idade, e o grupo e dividido da seguinte forma: 1- exercicios de alongamento; 2- explicacao da respiracao diafragmatica e da postura corporal para a pratica de mindfulness; 3- aplicacao da tecnica; 4- psicoeduacao do grupo a respeito da tecnica; 5- solicitacao de feedback aos pacientes. Na fase 1 sao adaptados 5 exercicios de alongamento do Lian Gong, um dos sistemas da ginastica terapeutica chinesa, com o objetivo de preparar o corpo dos participantes para a pratica de mindfulness. Na fase 2 e solicitado que os participantes sentem-se confortavelmente nas cadeiras, mantendo a coluna ereta, os ombros relaxados, o dorso das maos repousando sobre as pernas ou joelhos, o pescoco relaxado com o queixo ligeiramente para dentro, a lingua no palato, e os olhos fechados ou semiabertos. E, ainda, solicitado aos participantes que se mantenham em completo silencio e com o corpo imovel durante toda a pratica. Na fase 3 e aplicada a tecnica propriamente dita. Uma das meditacoes utilizadas e a atencao plena na respiracao, que e feita atraves da conducao verbal do terapeuta, mais ou menos da seguinte forma: torne-se consciente da sua respiracao, percebendo o ar entrar e sair enquanto voce respira; sinta a sua barriga subir quando o ar entra e descer quando sai; procure nao controlar a respiracao, apenas a observe passivamente; se pensamentos ou sentimentos surgirem em sua mente, nao tente suprimi-los nem os ignore, simplesmente observe-os; entao, volte para a percepcao da respiracao e do movimento da barriga, usando-as como âncoras; caso os mesmos pensamentos surjam de forma persistente, apenas os observe, sem julgar, e volte para a respiracao; perceba os pensamentos como nuvens passageiras, que vem e vao; procure nao lutar contra eles; sempre que sua mente, por qualquer motivo, se afastar da respiracao, traga-a suavemente de volta; para terminar a meditacao, mexa levemente os pes, as maos, se espreguice, abra os olhos, e permaneca por um minuto ou mais ainda em silencio. Ao termino, na fase 4, e explicado que esta tecnica pode auxiliar na impulsividade, no manejo da fissura e na diminuicao dos sintomas da ansiedade, funcionando como estrategia para a prevencao da recaida. Os pacientes tem relatado no feedback diminuicao significativa da fissura e dos sintomas de ansiedade durante a realizacao da tecnica. Alem disso, verbalizam que conseguem relaxar e percebem que a tecnica pode ser util apos a alta em situacoes de risco de recaida. Recomenda-se que a pratica de mindfulness seja utilizada como coadjuvante no tratamento dos dependentes de crack, e que mais pesquisas sejam feitas a este respeito.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse is one of the leading causes of loss of productivity, disease, and early death in the world. People typically start experimenting with drugs of abuse during adolescence, and about 20% of people who use drugs develop a substance abuse disorder. In general, drug use is more common in men than in women. However, when women use drugs, they are just as likely as men to develop a substance use disorder. Drugs of abuse induce euphoria, and the rewarding properties of drugs play an essential role in the early stages of drug use. After the development of dependence, cessation of drug use leads to somatic and affective withdrawal signs, which contributes to the maintenance of drug use. The intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) method can be used to measure the acute rewarding properties of drugs and the dysphoria associated with drug withdrawal. One of the main advantages of the ICSS method is that it provides a quantitative measure of the rewarding aspects of drug use and the aversive aspects of withdrawal. The ICSS method can be used to identify sex differences in the rewarding and aversive aspects of drug use.",

      "title": "Are Adolescent Smokers Addicted to Nicotine? The Suitability of the Nicotine Dependence Construct as Applied to Adolescents",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Adolescent cigarette smoking has long been regarded as a major public health problem. Particularly disconcerting is the observation that over the last several years, greater numbers of adolescents are taking up this destructive behavior. While some have assumed that the majority of these smokers are, or will become, nicotine dependent, the fact is that we know very little about the phenomenon of nicotine dependence in adolescence. In this paper, the author reviews the theoretical and empirical bases from which inferences regarding addictive smoking in adolescence can be drawn. It appears that although a significant proportion of teenage smokers do progress to dependence, this is not an inevitable outcome for all adolescent smokers. Moreover, the scientific study of nicotine dependence among adolescents is still in its infancy and, as such, more work in the area of measurement and assessment needs to be done. Implications for prevention and intervention efforts are also discussed.",

Patients high on marijuana rarely come to the ED, but frequently patients test positive for THC, the active portion of marijuana. Its presence in a urine toxicology screen is almost considered normal flora in many EDs. Simply stated, marijuana by itself is not particularly toxic, probably much less toxic than ethanol and clearly less toxic than many other street drugs. It's even entirely legal in some states. The average marijuana user hangs out with friends, laughs, chows down at the local restaurant, and enjoys listening to music in a mellowed-out state. Such a benign milieu is hardly the case with the use of the increasingly popular synthetic cannabinoids. Sold under a variety of monikers, most commonly spice and K2, synthetic cannabinoids, while analogues of tetrahydrocannabinol, otherwise known as THC, are hardly natural substances. First used in Europe, its use has skyrocketed in the United States over the past 10 years, and it has been associated with increasingly severe side effects and even death. Severe Toxicity Following Synthetic Cannabinoid Ingestion Lapoint J, James LP, et al. Clin Toxicol 2011;49(8):760 This is one of the few articles discussing the clinical aspects of synthetic cannabinoid use. It was written in 2011 when the commonly used K2 and spice were still available in various head shops and on the Internet. They were labeled “not for human consumption” or “aroma therapy only,” but those who bought them knew what they were. These authors note that the clinical effects of synthetic cannabinoids are from full agonism and increased potency for the CB1 and CB2 receptors, the same receptors to which delta-9-THC exerts its psychoactive effect. THC has only partial CB1-CB2 agonism, while the synthetics fully stimulate the body's receptors. A few reports in the literature describe a withdrawal scenario in those who are frequent users and have abrupt cessation. Two deaths, a suicide and a coronary ischemic event had been reported when this article was written. This article is a single case report and a discussion of exposure to the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 found in K2 and spice. The authors reported a 48-year-old man who ingested an unknown powder that he had purchased on the Internet to get high. He quickly became agitated and had a generalized seizure. The seizure activity recurred numerous times, but was eventually abated with IV lorazepam. The patient was intubated because of concerns for airway protection. Initial basic blood tests, except for a mildly elevated CPK, were negative, as were an EEG and a noncontrast head CT. The urine toxicology screening by the hospital's laboratory was negative for drugs of abuse, including THC. The patient developed refractory SVT shortly after hospitalization that required cardioversion. When the powder that the patient ingested was analyzed, it was found to contain JWH-018, a common potent synthetic cannabinoid. The patient became asymptomatic after three days of hospitalization and was discharged.Table: Adverse Effects of Synthetic CannabinoidsThese authors reported one of the first cases of repetitive seizures and supraventricular tachycardia following the confirmed use of the widely available synthetic cannabinoid, JWH-018. Seizures following THC use are rare. The authors point out that synthetic cannabinoids stimulate the central and peripheral CB1 and CB2 receptors, the same sites of THC activation. CB1 receptors are located presynaptically on glutaminergic and GABAergic synapses, and play a role in modulating neurotransmitting signaling mechanisms. Comment: Naturally grown marijuana is a complex substance that is composed of 50 to 60 cannabinoids. The most psychoactive component is delta-9-THC. This is the component tested for in urine immunoassay toxicology screens. Analogues of natural cannabinoids are the synthetic cannabinoids, substances that are chemically created. Available in Europe for about 10 years, with the first reported case in the United States in 2008, some synthetic cannabinoids are now classified as Class 1 controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). It is currently illegal to possess, sell, or use a few specific synthetic cannabinoids. Many similar chemicals have escaped regulation, however. Commonly marketed as incense, aromatherapy, or herbal remedies, the compounds are sold under a variety of names, the most common being K2 and spice. The initial low-dose effects are similar to natural marijuana, but more serious and even life-threatening symptoms are associated with synthetic cannabinoids, likely from increased and full stimulation of cannabis receptors throughout the body. The chemical analogues of THC used in synthetic cannabinoids are constantly changing to avoid control and regulatory oversight, and it is difficult to say what is in the current street drug. Synthetic cannabinoids are made from inexpensive compounds that can be obtained legally online. Those in spice and K2 are termed JWH-018 and JWH-073, and are now classified as schedule 1 substances. A 2012 analysis found that street cannabinoids were relatively pure mixtures of these compounds. Unlike many other drugs, impurities or residue from the manufacturing process were not the culprits. Numerous other substances, such as synthetic opioids, caffeine, and a potent B-2 agonist, clenbuterol, may be mixed with the cannabinoids, however. The basic chemicals are combined with herbs, marijuana, and other plant products, often merely sprayed on. No delta-9-THC is contained in true synthetic marijuana, so the urine drug screen for marijuana will be negative. No assay is currently available for emergency clinicians to identify synthetic marijuana. Advanced symptoms simulate a number of other conditions and drug toxicities. Synthetic cannabinoid users are usually young men in their 20s and 30s, but it is also commonly used in high school. More than 50 known synthetic cannabinoids can be manufactured by illegal drug producers, and are candidates for synthetic marijuana. The degree of toxicity depends on the amount used and the specific compound added, but specific additives are constantly changing to avoid governmental regulations. The psychological effects of synthetic cannabinoids are similar to THC and in small doses cause pleasurable mood-changing effects as well as tachycardia, red eyes, increased appetite, ataxia, and slurred speech. Synthetic cannabinoids, however, have a much greater potential for serious toxicity, including hallucinations, delirium, psychosis, and fever. The emergency clinician is most likely to see the more virulent cases. A wide spectrum of clinical effects can be experienced from taking synthetic cannabinoids. They are mostly used by inhalation of smoke, and the effects last several hours to days depending on the specific compound and the potency. The most common clinical effects are agitation, vomiting, and confusion, typically lasting four to eight hours, but serious toxicity includes severe agitation, seizures, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis, symptoms seen with methamphetamines, cocaine, and a variety of other drugs of abuse. Other symptoms include headache and varying degrees of dystonia, hyperreflexia, and hypertonic limbs. Some patients may present with catatonia, coma, or difficult-to-describe altered mental status. The vast majority are tachycardic. The letters JWH in the chemical ingredients are the initials of the inventor Dr. John W. Hoffman, an organic chemist who developed multiple synthetic THC analogs to study cannabinoid receptors in the mid-1990s. A single mg of JWH-018 can produce significant intoxication. The DEA issued a final order in March 2011 banning five specific synthetic cannabinoids, JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-200, CP-47, 497 and CP-47, 497-C8. Schedule 1 drugs are substances that are unsafe, highly abused, and have no medical usage. To be defined as class 1 drugs by the DEA, only these specific substances must be present, so many other synthetic cannabinoids are still unregulated. The affinity of JWH chemicals to cannabinoid brain and peripheral receptors is much greater than that of THC. Contrary to the partial action of THC at the marijuana receptors, synthetic cannabinoids have full agonist activity and potency, with a longer duration of action and an increased likelihood of adverse effects. There are likely other neuroreceptors, such as serotonin and NDMA, involved in toxicity. Multiple side effects may occur. Diphenhydramine has had some success in reversing some of the dystonic-like reactions from synthetic cannabinoids. Overall, the use of other substances and the variability of the synthetic cannabinoids in the products make it difficult to identify and relate a specific agent to specific symptoms. Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication, therefore, is a clinical diagnosis. There is no way to prove use, patients usually don't know exactly what they smoked, and laboratory tests are unremarkable. It makes little sense to send off a urine test to a commercial laboratory for a very expensive, delayed analysis, but that can be done in unusual cases. I don't know whether the medical examiner checks the presence of synthetic cannabinoids in routine toxicology studies, but I doubt it. The reference laboratory can use liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify synthetic cannabinoids. It may be difficult for a reference laboratory to accurately analyze a substance, however, with constantly changing chemical structures and compounds. Most users obviously are aficionados of synthetic cannabinoids because of their similar effect to marijuana, often thinking they are safer. Some use it because its negative drug screen may be required for work or other purposes. Interestingly, the U.S. Air Force is now screening urine for synthetic cannabinoids. The Air Force can detect five synthetic cannabinoid compounds, but there are hundreds of potentially available substances that are fair game to be considered synthetic marijuana.

      "title": "CHAPTER 1. Exposure to Lead and Cognitive Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Lead's neurotoxicity has been recognized for centuries. In spite of this knowledge, in the twentieth century, lead-based products— from gasoline to paint to other consumer products—pervaded the consumer and industrial landscape. The upshot was a dramatic increase in humans’ exposures to lead. In the United States, powerful commercial interests, abetted by willing or negligent government officials, overwhelmed the protests of public health advocates, who warned about the harm caused by lead exposure. Thus the removal of lead from these products occurred very slowly. By the 1990s, when lead had been removed from most consumer gasoline and paint, many individuals had experienced protracted exposures, some over the entire course of their lives. The cognitive impairment resulting from high-dose occupational exposure is well-established, and exposure at much lower doses in children can impair their intellectual development. Yet accumulating evidence indicates that long-term exposures at low doses and/or past exposures (that have since ended) may have effects that reverberate in the cognition of older age. Moreover, although lead exposures have declined in many parts of the world, pockets of exposure remain. These continued exposures and an aging global population mean that it is critical to continue to reduce exposures and better understand, and mitigate, the effects of lead exposure on cognitive aging. In this chapter, we review the critical events that resulted in widespread exposures to lead, the mechanisms underlying lead's deleterious effects on cognition, and findings from research on cumulative lead exposure and cognitive function in older age.",

The smoking of marijuana is an increasingly observed phenomenon in the adolescent population and even more common nowadays than cigarette smoking. A special focus should therefore aim to the effects of marijuana in that particular age group. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the effects of marijuana because their brain and neuro-circuits are still developing. The exposure of marijuana to the still pruning brain causes not only short-term cognitive impairment but also permanent, life-long reduction in their cognitive abilities. This is due to marijuana's effect on processing speed and a reduction in gray matter in several brain regions as well as a decrease in white matter. Marijuana is viewed as a",

It is associated with increased healthcare costs and disability, greater absenteeism, decrements in job performance, and increased risk of injury, and secondhand smoke is a major pollution problem. Tobacco dependence responds to treatment, and employers have several opportunities to offer treatment to employees and their families. Smoke-free environments can help smokers cut back or quit. Combining sound workplace policies and treatment with community involvement in tobacco control provides synergies to reduce tobacco use in the community as well as in the workforce.

      "title": "Effects of acute and chronic nicotine administration on probability discounting",
      "abstract": "Nicotine use is a continuing public health concern. Smokers are more likely to make risky or maladaptive decisions compared to nonsmokers, so the relation between nicotine and risky choice warrants further investigation. Risky choice can be operationally defined as the choice for a larger, uncertain reinforcer over a smaller, certain reinforcer and can be assessed through a probability-discounting procedure. Acute nicotine administration has been shown to alter risky choice, but because the everyday smoker uses nicotine repeatedly, more research on chronic administration is needed and would allow for assessment of tolerance or sensitization of any effects. The present study examined effects of acute and repeated nicotine administration on probability discounting. Sprague–Dawley rats were used as subjects and the probability-discounting task involved discrete-trial choices between a small, certain reinforcer and a larger, uncertain reinforcer. The probability of larger-reinforcer delivery decreased across blocks within each session. Acute nicotine (0.1–1.0 mg/kg) administration dose-dependently increased risky choice, increased lose-stay ratios (a measure of response perseveration), and decreased reinforcement frequency. Tolerance to nicotine’s effects on larger-reinforcer choice was observed after repeated 1.0 mg/kg nicotine administration. The results of the present study add to the existing literature that acute nicotine administration increases risky choice and demonstrates that tolerance to this effect develops after chronic exposure to the drug. Possible behavioral mechanisms behind this effect are discussed, as are suggestions for future research on nicotine and risky choice.",

Marijuana is psychically addictive, but in its case, there is no physical addiction as in the case of high-risk drugs (heroin) and over 70% of consumers do not recognize marijuana addiction. This substance can induce an acute psychotic episode and the onset of schizophrenia. Usually, the patient’s family is the one who asks for help in their case. We chose to present the clinical case of a patient, initially, marijuana addicted, who, after stopping it, developed an internet gaming disorder addiction. The digital environment is constantly evolving, growing exponentially at a considerable rate and online networks mean creating connections between people, minds and memories, regardless of their location in space and time. Many of us have different passions but there are also people who take these passions to the extreme as is the case with our patient who has developed an addiction to video games. Thus, we can conclude that one addiction can be replaced by another one in a very short time.",

The rarity of reports of these withdrawal reactions may reflect the fact that they are mild and seldom observed in cannabis users.

      "title": "Medications May Ease Cannabis Withdrawal But Fail to Achieve Abstinence",
      "abstract": "Back to table of contents Previous article Next article Clinical & ResearchFull AccessMedications May Ease Cannabis Withdrawal But Fail to Achieve AbstinenceNick ZagorskiNick ZagorskiSearch for more papers by this authorPublished Online:15 Jul 2019https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.pn.2019.6b18AbstractAmong the many potential compounds that have been tested, n-acetylcysteine appears to be most effective at reducing cannabis use, especially in patients aged 21 and younger.Marijuana, or cannabis, remains far and away the most commonly used illicit substance. Nearly 41 million people aged 12 or older used marijuana in 2017, according to the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Though some states would dispute the “illicit” term, the fact remains that 1 in 10 adults who use marijuana will develop a dependency; and given its widespread use, psychiatrists will likely encounter a patient with cannabis use disorder (CUD).Currently no medications are approved for CUD, and behavioral therapy remains the preferred treatment. But some studies have pointed to medications that may benefit patients with CUD. Frances Levin, M.D., the Kennedy-Leavy Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, reviewed these options during a session on advances in treating substance use disorders at APA’s Annual Meeting in May.“These studies did not use a strong-enough dose or treatment length to uncover an observable reduction in cannabis use.” —Frances Levin, M.D.One common approach to treating patients with CUD is to manage their withdrawal symptoms, which can include irritability, anxiety, and sleep problems. Studies show that the anxiolytic buspirone; the insomnia medication zolpidem; and guanfacine, which is approved for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, effectively manage symptoms of withdrawal. However, Levin said there is little evidence that easing withdrawal helps promote cannabis abstinence (as measured by reports of cannabis use by participants with CUD in research studies).Some preliminary studies suggested that quetiapine, an antipsychotic, and gabapentin, an anticonvulsant—both of which reduce withdrawal symptoms—might also promote abstinence. However, larger randomized studies suggest these medications do not increase abstinence in patients with CUD (though quetiapine may somewhat reduce daily cannabis use).Another approach to reducing cannabis use by patients with CUD may be to treat them with medications that bind to cannabinoid (CBD) receptors, similar to how nicotine replacement therapy works in smokers. To date, synthetic, CBD-binding drugs like dronabinol or rimonabant have not shown an ability to reduce the subjective pleasure of taking cannabis or promote abstinence. One exception might be the potent CBD agonist nabilone, which has shown efficacy in early studies, but Levin noted the high cost of this medication might limit its use in clinical settings.Levin suggested that the most promising compound for decreasing cannabis use appears to be n-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant that can be purchased over the counter. NAC does not directly target CBD receptors but rather helps restore normal levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is believed to be associated with compulsive, drug-seeking behaviors. NAC does not work for all patients, but data suggest that teens and young adults up to 21 years old are more likely to stop using cannabis when given NAC alongside behavioral therapy versus those who receive behavioral therapy alone.Levin told the audience that that the failure to identify compounds that help patients with CUD achieve abstinence may have more to do with study design than lack of pharmacological efficacy. “In many cases I believe these studies did not use a strong-enough dose or treatment length to uncover an observable reduction in cannabis use,” she said. “Unfortunately, there is little enthusiasm from funding agencies to repeat these studies in larger populations.”She suggested future efforts focus on enrolling more specific patient groups—such as adolescents only—or excluding patients with mild CUD since they likely would not benefit as much from treatment.“We should also address the question of whether abstinence is the ideal outcome when testing medications,” she continued. More moderate, “harm- reduction” outcomes like reducing the total number of days cannabis is consumed or the average consumption per day might reveal that some of these available medications can help patients curb their cannabis consumption. ■ ISSUES NewArchived",

For a variety of reasons, including performance improvement, self-treatment of otherwise untreated mental illness, and coping with pressures such as pressure to perform, injuries, physical discomfort, and retirement from sport, athletes may turn to drugs. Doping is a term used to describe this type of abuse. Doping has a long history, dating back to when organized sports existed. Improved drug testing detection technologies and improvements in scientific research have led to the discovery and use of compounds that may later be outlawed, resulting in \"advances\" in doping strategies.

      "title": "Drugs in College",
      "abstract": "Experimentation is a large part of the college experi- ence. It could be argued that no campus is completely clean of drug abuse and the three most common drugs used by col- lege students are alcohol, marijuana, and prescription stimu- lants. This article will focus on the two legal, but recklessly abused drugs: the godfather of campus drugs - alcohol, and the new kid on the block - prescription stimulants. Drugs in College THE MIND FALL THE MIND Alcohol Fermentation is said to be the oldest chemistry utilized by man. Alcohol sat proudly in the holy grail during the last supper, intoxicated the Trojans during their celebration of a big wooden horse, and was both the gift and the weapon of choice of the Grecian/Roman god Bacchus. Alcohol, a depressant, has accompanied man throughout the ages, mak- ing him hyper-social, dizzy, numb, indecent, unconscious, and ultimately hung-over. So how does alcohol inflict its power? An alcohol is an organic compound with one or more hydroxyl or alcohol (- OH) groups attached. Ethanol, in particular, is the alcohol that we consume. Although the fine details of the biochem- istry of alcohol are still uncertain, it has long been suspected that the transmission of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a mostly inhibitory neurotransmitter, is somehow effected by alcohol (Paul 2006). In 2006, researchers demonstrated that the actions of GABA are amplified by the presence of alco- hol at the GABAA receptors, a ligand-gated ion channel in charge of GABA transmission (Hanchar 2006 and Wallner 2006). When GABA binds to the GABAA receptors, the pore opens, allowing chloride ions (Cl-) to rush down the electro- chemical gradient. The result is an axon with a charge more negative than one at normal resting membrane potential. Thus, depolarizing the neuron becomes extremely difficult http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/pharmaceuticals/images/rit alin.jpg Microscope view of Ritalin (Siegel 1999). Ultimately, this process impairs fluidity in movement and delays reaction time. While most alcohol consumers drink only until they are tipsy, sometimes they lose control and drink to the point of being blacked out. Later, they may possess no memory of events that had occurred during that time. This black-out period has recently been proven to be connected to the effects of alcohol on the hippocampus, an area of the brain in which short-term memories are stored (White 2000). Non-alcohol related damage to the hippocampi causes similar behavioral effects in comparison to the consequences of drinking alcohol. To illustrate, in one famous procedure, the hippocampi of a patient, HM, were removed in order to relieve his epileptic seizures. The subject continued to score above average on IQ tests despite lacking his hippocampi. Researchers also found that the patient was perfectly capable of carrying on a coherent conversation with another individ- ual. However, upon returning to the room after just a few minutes of absence, dialogue with the subject would reveal that he could neither recall who the speaker was, nor what the conversation had been about. This phenomenon closely resembles that of an alcohol induced black-out, further sug- gesting that alcohol may affect the hippocampus. So far, the alcohol side-effects of drowsy, uncoordinated movements and memory loss have been explained, but what about the symptom with which alcohol is most associated - poor judgment? Researchers have hypothesized that the frontal lobe, which controls information processing, impulse suppression, and social awareness, might be the target region that causes the lack of judgment after alcohol consumption. Sure enough, it has been shown that the short-term effects of intoxication include a decrease in metabolism and activity in the frontal lobe (Wang et al. 2000). Similarly, chronic alco- hol abuse can damage and even shrink the frontal lobe, but there is much less information on alcohol's acute effects on this region of the brain (Kril and Halliday 1999). The frontal lobe has also been chosen as an area of alco- hol research because of the similarity in behavior between intoxicated individuals and those with frontal lobe damage. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a disease that can illustrate the effects of an impaired frontal lobe, which may illuminate the impact of alcohol on this region of the brain. In patients with FTLD, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain experience tissue atrophy and shrinkage. Patients tend to lose such characteristics as: good judgment, manners, or common sense During an interview with an FTLD sufferer (to be referred to as the interviewee), the interviewee seemed normal at first, though perhaps a little too relaxed and happy to be at an by Joy Yang",

Sometimes the family members as well as friends also ignore to such activities of user knowingly or unknowingly. Users often take beetle with tobacco products in order to conceal the fact, which may also harm to their body. As the time passes and if it is not controlled by him-self or family, then such person falls down to an another world, from where he does not want to come back and he makes distances from family as well as good friends. At last a stage comes where he becomes ruined socially, economically, physically and mentally. Some users even try to commit suicide due to frustration. Homicidal activities and sexual violence may also be noticed. Now-a-days alcoholism is a commonest cause for incidents of murder and rape as well as traffic accidents. Hence if the consumer adopt the lifestyle described in Ayurveda and Yoga, then one can give up the addiction of alcohol and able to lead a happy and healthy life.",

      "abstract": "Among Americans' many consumable vices (e.g., illicit drugs, tobacco, alcohol, sugars, salt, fat foods), represents a unique and popular ingredient that infiltrates multiple product lines, directly impacts individual and communal health (especially among children and adolescents), and yet enjoys relatively little regulation.' Caffeine is pervasive in our beverages, foods, and medicines. Americans may find it difficult, even impossible, to completely eliminate from their diets. Caffeine is a natural ingredient in coffees, chocolates, and teas. It is intentionally added to products ranging from sodas, sports drinks, performance dietary supplements, alcoholic beverages, headache medicines, and even drinking water. Routine, extensive ingestion of America's favorite drug reflects our societal acquiescence in addiction. A caffeine high is an innocent pleasure that millions undertake one or more times each day to stimulate their minds and bodies to perform at peak levels. Caffeine provides a daily, inexpensive boost of energy that makes life better for many Americans, regardless of their social class, ethnicity, or status.",

      "title": "Le choix de la cocaïne, une question de délai",
      "abstract": "L'addiction a la cocaine est un trouble comportemental qui touche plusieurs millions de personnes en Europe. L'etude des mecanismes neurobiologiques de ce trouble repose beau-coup sur l'utilisation de modeles animaux, generalement des rats ou des souris. Dans la situation experimentale standard, ces animaux ont acces a la cocaine sans autre choix possible. Dans ces conditions assez artificielles, il est difficile de savoir si leur consommation de cocaine est in-fluencee par un etat d'addiction ou plutot par l'absence d'autres recompenses disponibles. En fait, quand on offre a des rats une autre recompense pendant l'acces a la cocaine (e.g., de l'eau sucree pendant quelques secondes), la vaste majorite d'entre eux s'abstient pour l'option alter-native. Ce resultat semble difficile a reconcilier avec les predictions associees a l’hypothese dopaminergique de l’addiction. Selon cette hypothese, la liberation supranormale de dopamine (aussi bien en intensite qu’en duree) provoquee par la cocaine lui confere un pouvoir recom-pensant largement superieur a celui d'autres recompenses (y compris l'eau sucree), et devrait se traduire par un choix quasi-exclusif pour la drogue. Ce paradoxe apparent peut etre resolu si l’on prend aussi en compte les delais imposes par la pharmacocinetique de la cocaine. En effet, une fois administree, meme par une voie rapide comme la voie intraveineuse, il faut un certain temps a la cocaine pour atteindre le circuit dopaminergique de la recompense dans le cerveau, ce qui impose un certain delai a la survenue des effets recompensants de la drogue. Selon notre hypothese, si ce delai d'action etait suffisamment long, il pourrait reduire la valeur de la cocaine au moment du choix en-dessous de celle de la recompense alternative, moins recompensante mais plus immediate. Ce travail de these avait pour but general de tester cette hypothese. Nos resultats confirment que les effets de la cocaine ne surviennent qu’apres un delai de plusieurs dizaines de secondes. Par ailleurs, lorsque l’influence de ce long delai etait neutralisee au mo-ment du choix, les animaux inversaient leur preference en faveur de la cocaine, confirmant que la cocaine genere bien une quantite de recompense superieure a l’option alternative. Ce travail nous revele egalement d’importantes lacunes dans notre comprehension du delai-drogue et de son impact sur le choix. Afin d’y remedier, des etudes complementaires, aussi bien theoriques qu’experimentales, devront etre envisagees a l’avenir.",

      "abstract": "Vaping uses an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) for inhaling vaporized and aerosolized ingredients. A significant subset of the psychiatric patient population will use ENDS and may have concurrent cigarette usage. In the clinical case highlighted here, a patient with significant nicotine use is prescribed clozapine. He typically inhales vaporized nicotine solution, but during a chemical dependency treatment, he was provided cigarettes instead of ENDS to prevent him from consuming substances other than nicotine. Exposure to cigarette smoke led to clinically worsening psychotic symptoms that reversed when he was discharged from treatment, stopped cigarette use, and resumed ENDS use. However, his extremely high nicotine exposure then led to symptoms resembling an anxiety disorder, which resolved when ENDS use decreased. Psychiatrists must become familiar with patients' vaping and smoking habits and be alert to altered plasma drug levels in patients whose method of nicotine ingestion changes over time.",

      "abstract": "Drugs are chemicals. Different drugs, because of their chemical structures, can affect the body in different ways. In fact, some drugs can even change a person's body and brain in ways that last long after the person has stopped taking drugs, maybe even permanently. Most abused drugs directly or indirectly target the brain's reward system by flooding the circuit with dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter present in regions of the brain that regulate movement, emotion, cognition, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. When drugs enter the brain, they can actually change how the brain performs its jobs. These changes are what lead to compulsive drug use, the hallmark of addiction. Although initial drug use may be voluntary, drugs have been shown to alter brain chemistry, which interferes with an individual's ability to make decisions and can lead to compulsive craving, seeking and use. This then becomes a substance dependency. All drugs of abuse - nicotine, cocaine, marijuana, and others - affect the brains \"reward” circuit, which is part of the limbic system. This flood of dopamine is what causes the \"high” or euphoria associated with drug abuse.",

      "abstract": "Stimulants have been used throughout human history for a variety of reasons. High levels of stress and the demanding nature of medical school make their usage among medical students particularly common. The most prevalent stimulant used by students is coffee, followed by tea and other forms of caffeine like sugary energy drinks. In addition, amphetamine-based medications for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been increasing in popularity, which many students take illicitly. Students report taking various forms of stimulants to promote cognitive enhancement, prolong wakefulness and retain focus for long periods of time. Moderate doses of caffeine and amphetamines would lead to enhanced alertness and concentration. However, large increases in dosage or frequency would lead to an increased risk of toxicity and adverse effects. The positive outcomes from stimulant consumption are often overshadowed by the negative side effects and incorrect dosage. Thus, it appears that usage of stimulants should be limited, in favor of a more sustainable approach to cognitive enhancement.",

      "title": "Vaccines against nicotine",
      "abstract": "AbstractMedications against any dependence-inducing drug face a dilemma: if they are efficient, they will induce withdrawal symptoms and the patient is likely to stop taking his medication. Anti drug vaccines are irreversible, provide protection over years and need booster injections far beyond the critical phase of acute withdrawal symptoms. Interacting rather with the drug in the blood than with a receptor in the brain, the vaccines are in addition free of side effects due to central interaction. For drugs like nicotine interacting with different types of receptors in many organs, this is a further advantage. There are three reasons, that anti drug vaccines have first been developed against nicotine. Firstly, in most parts of the world 20- to 50% of the adult population smoke and any smoking cessation treatment will have an important impact on public health and be commercially a very attractive product. The second reason are the smokers themselves, which would like to quit in significant numbers and which have shown good compliance for any form of treatment. Thirdly, the quantities of cocaine or heroine taken by dependant persons are higher than the quantity of nicotine per cigarette, which makes an anti nicotine vaccine the easier vaccine project.Three anti nicotine vaccines are today in an advanced stage of clinical evaluation. We report here how those vaccines work, on the progress of the trials and future developments to expect. Results show that the efficiency of the vaccines is directly related to the antibody levels of the probates, a fact which will help to optimize further the vaccine effect. We expect the vaccines to appear on the market during a time window between 2009 and 2011.",

      "abstract": "Background: The mechanism of action of varenicline as a partial agonist may make it useful for cigarette reduction as smokers experience reduced craving and withdrawal at the same time their cigarettes provide reduced reinforcement value. Case Description: The current case report describes a 51-year-old African American woman using varenicline to reduce her cigarette use. After making a substantial reduction in cigarettes per day (from 25 to 8), the patient unexpectedly began smoking considerably more (from 8 to 20) after 11 days treatment with varenicline. Conclusions: The temporary increase in smoking while taking varenicline was likely the result of an ‘extinction burst’ where the extinction of a reward (e.g., nicotine's rewarding effects after smoking a cigarette) was temporarily associated with an increase in the behaviour usually associated with the reward (e.g., smoking a cigarette). Once explaining to her that no amount of cigarettes would overcome the feeling of reduced reward she likely felt while taking varenicline, she was able to reduce her smoking again.",

Intravenous drug users can develop respiratory complications from granuloma formation after injecting insoluble adulterants (Glassroth et al. 1986), and the inhalation of high-temperature vapours such as those of heroin, crack, or free-base cocaine can also cause respiratory disease or damage (Hughes and Calverley 1988), especially when the drug contains contaminants (Tashkin et al. 1987). Regular cannabis smoking can lead to respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest Such symptoms are similar to those induced by cigarette smoking but can occur (independently of cigarette smoking) even after a relatively short duration of cannabis use (Taylor et al. 2000).",

An altered state of consciousness is a kind of disassociation from ordinary consciousness, and can take on many different forms. Attaining altered states of consciousness is a hallmark of rites in primitive cultures, as well as urban charismatic churches. Altered states of consciousness can be induced in many different ways, from drugs to shamanic drumming to fasting, to dancing in discos with strobe lights. Substances used by various cultures to induce altered states of consciousness are: ayahuasca, tobacco, peyote, kava, alcohol, mead, qat, psychedelic drugs. There is extensive literature on the ceremonial use of peyote among Indians in the United States and Mexico, where its use extends back about 2000 years. Kava, a mild narcotic that has been a stimulantrelaxant- social drink throughout Oceania for at least a thousand years. Alcohol is a culturally accepted intoxicant used worldwide.

      "abstract": "º III » Le terme « tabagisme », issu du vocabulaire médical, qualifie l'intoxication aiguë ou chronique par des quantités abusives de tabac, bien que depuis longtemps il soit à tort utilisé pour désigner la simple consommation de ce dernier.Le tabagisme dit « actif » est, par opposition au tabagisme passif, l'inhalation volontaire de la fumée de tabac contenue dans une cigarette, un cigare ou une pipe ainsi que la consommation des formes de tabac non fumées.Le tabagisme passif est quant à lui l'inhalation involontaire de la fumée dégagée par la cigarette ou le cigare laissé par exemple dans le cendrier, ou encore exhalé par un ou plusieurs fumeurs.Le tabac est un facteur de risque important dans l'apparition des maladies cardiovasculaires, pulmonaires et des cancers, les populations de fumeurs présentant au même âge une morbi-mortalité plus élevée que les non-fumeurs.Fumer altère le fonctionnement et/ou l'intégrité de tous les organes du corps humain et le sevrage tabagique, quel que soit l'âge auquel il est initié, conduit rapidement à une amélioration de l'état de santé de l'individu et à une réduction significative des risques liés au tabagisme.Malgré de nombreuses hausses du prix du tabac décidées par les gouvernements successifs, fumer ne coûte pas encore assez cher pour décourager la plupart des consommateurs.Bien que le « budget cigarettes » puisse être parfois conséquent, il ne ruine pas comme cela peut être le cas lors de la consommation d'autres drogues moins accessibles.Il s'agit donc d'une addiction qui reste abordable, et ce, même chez les plus jeunes.Le tabagisme est d'ailleurs répandu dans toutes les classes sociales, surtout les plus modestes.Enfin, il semble indispensable de rappeler que le tabac est actuellement parfaitement légal malgré les effets néfastes qui lui sont attribués et qu'il constitue même une source de revenus non négligeable pour l'État.Contrairement à d'autres addictions comme l'alcoolisme, le tabac n'entraîne ni déchéance intellectuelle, ni ivresse, et par conséquent ne perturbe pas le fonctionnement familial ou socioprofessionnel.Le regard social sur le tabac est donc très différent de celui que l'on a sur l'alcool ou d'autres drogues.En effet, le tabagisme est toléré, accepté, voire même par certains, encouragé.Ces éléments font la particularité de cette drogue et augmentent son danger.Le tabac tue en silence et c'est particulièrement l'initiale discrétion et la latence de ses effets qui le rendent dangereux.Nous savons pertinemment que les maladies qui affectent le plus une",

      "title": "39 Binge Drinking: Not an Innocent Problem",
      "abstract": "More and more paediatricians are confronted with teen drinking and the problems that result from it. A new trend is the so called “binge-drinking”. This means consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol in a very short period of time with the goal of getting drunk as fast as possible. Within 1 hour after ingestion, alcohol is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. Toxic effects of alcohol can occur from a plasma concentration of 0.5–1‰ (= 500–1000 mg/l) or an intake of 600 mg/kg alcohol. This is equal to ingestion of 120 ml liquor (alcohol concentration 30%) in an adolescent of 40kg. The effects are caused by a suppression of the central nervous system and they occur faster in younger people than in adults due to less extracellular volume. Also individual factors like gender, use of other medications or drugs and drinking habits play a role. All this factors can result in a broad spectrum of symptoms (relaxation, altered perception of the environment, prolonged reaction time, amnesia, nausea, vomiting and in more severe cases respiratory depression, coma and death). When a child with possible alcohol intoxication is admitted to the emergency department, general “APLS” guidelines (Advanced Pediatric Life Support) should be followed. After the “acute” event of the alcohol intoxication, multidisciplinary follow-up of the patient is very important. In Belgium, no objective data exist on the problem of binge drinking whilst among paediatricians there is great concern about it. Therefore, we will conduct a national survey on this topic.",

Should this war be supported because a smaller percentage of teenagers use marijuana, or should it be opposed because a larger percentage of teenagers and young adults use cocaine and crack in the USA? Should people be optimistic when multi-billion dollar shipments of cocaine are confiscated, or pessimistic that seizures continue to increase yet have such little impact on price and consumption? Drug prohibition was doomed to failure from the start, no less so than alcohol prohibition, and the best alternative is an immediate return to complete legalization of such drugs.",

      "title": "No smoke, no fire: What the initial literature suggests regarding vapourized cannabis and respiratory risk.",
      "abstract": "As marijuana laws change, questions about the plant’s impact on respiratory function will undoubtedly increase. The human lung did not evolve to inhale the byproducts of combustion efficiently. Smoking marijuana does not harm lung function as dramatically as smoking tobacco does. Links between smoking marijuana and actual lung cancer are weak and difficult to replicate. Nevertheless, the habit clearly increases symptoms of respiratory irritation such as tightness in the chest, wheezing and coughing. It also has the potential to alter lung function when dose and frequency of use are high. Using stronger cannabis extracts has the potential to limit exposure to irritants, but data regarding this phenomenon are lacking. Many medical marijuana users prefer to use the entire plant. It appears to alter subjective state less dramatically as well as show lower potential for creating tolerance. Edible preparations are an obvious choice that would certainly not add byproducts of combustion to the lung, but these lack the rapid onset and easy titration of dosage available with inhaled products. Thus, the cannabis vapourizer appears to be an ideal harm-reduction approach to safer use.\r\n\r\nThe vapourizer runs heated air across the plant without igniting it, releasing the cannabinoids in a vapour free from the byproducts of combustion. Some types rely on the user’s own inhalation to draw the hot air past the plant material, potentially exposing the lungs to more heat. Other devices blow air into an isolated bag, separating the heating element from the user and avoiding heat exposure. Laboratory work shows that cannabis vapour is composed almost exclusively of cannabinoids with virtually no pyrolitic compounds. The vapourizer raises cannabinoid levels in humans but does not raise exhaled CO levels. One pre-post design clinical trial showed that users with respiratory irritation improved symptoms and lung function after switching to a vapourizer. In short, vapourizers show promise for cannabis users who want to avoid pulmonary problems and prefer a more rapid onset than edibles provide.",

Multiple mechanisms induced by tobacco use lead to less strong, less healthy, mineral-deficient vertebrae with reduced bone blood supply and fewer and less functional bone-forming cells among chronic smokers. Compared to nonsmokers, chronic smokers develop advanced bony degradation, are more likely to suffer from spinal column degenerative disease, and seem more susceptible to traumatic vertebral injury. Spinal fusion procedures in chronic smokers are less often clinically and radiographically successful, compared to similar procedures performed among nonsmokers for definitive biological, physiological, and mechanical reasons.",

In this study, health consequences across four dimensions of physical, social, mental and economic health were similar for the concurrent and cocaine group, but both of these groups had significantly worse health profiles across all dimensions than those dependent on alcohol alone.",

      "abstract": "Youth around the world take up smoking and use tobacco products at high rates. Young people may not grasp the long-term consequences of tobacco use, although tobacco consumption and exposure has been shown to have significant negative health effects. Youth use a variety of tobacco products that are smoked, chewed, or sniffed, including machine-manufactured cigarettes, cigars, bidis, kreteks, sticks, and snuff. Prevention efforts have focused on countering those aspects that are believed to contribute to smoking uptake, such as tobacco industry advertising and promotion, and access to tobacco. There are many aspects of tobacco promotion through the media that have been more difficult to control, however, such as product placement within popular cinema movies. Once a youth has taken up tobacco, he or she is more likely than an adult to become addicted and should be offered treatment for tobacco cessation. Although there is not yet sufficient evidence to prove efficacy, the same treatments are suggested for youth as are recommended for adults, including nicotine replacement products. Given the severity of the tobacco epidemic worldwide and the devastating health effects on an individual and population basis, there are currently many efforts to curtail the tobacco problem, including the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It is through comprehensive and collaborative efforts such as this that the global hazard of tobacco is most likely to be overcome.",

In Bonny Island, it has become most worrisome the rate at which young people are embracing drugs freely and unchecked. Worst still, young people are generating their mixtures using modern substances with unusual elements to create their own formula for severe drug intake. This means that drug intake has graduated from the use of sedatives like cocaine, heroin and cannabis that we used to know to potent mixture of several drugs to attain fatal overdose. For example, a cocktail of drugs like codeine, tramadol, cannabis with juice or soft drink is called “gutter water”. More crude is the smoking of lizard dung, sniffing of petrol, glue, urine and sewage as inhalant. This is gradually eating deep into our society like cancer. Actually, substance abuse is now part of a modern society but very worrisome is the alarming rate at which young adults are embracing hard substances.",

      "abstract": "O uso de drogas sempre permeou a existencia humana, sendo visto em determinados grupos sociais como um comportamento natural uma vez que alivia dores e sofrimentos em alguns momentos e produz estimulo e entusiasmo entre outros. A cocaina e uma das drogas cujo consumo tem crescido nos ultimos anos na America do Sul, e em especial no Brasil, sendo uma de suas apresentacoes, o crack a mais consumida. Essa droga ilicita, estimulante do sistema nervoso central, muitas vezes leva a pessoa dependente a ter prejuizos no âmbito fisico, economico e social. O isolamento ao qual a pessoa dependente do crack esta exposta configura-se em situacao extrema de vulnerabilidade social que se expoem a consequencias de uma conjuntura social maior e mais abrangente que transcende o ato de usar a droga. O objetivo deste estudo foi compreender os significados do uso nocivo de crack por pessoas em tratamento da dependencia. Pesquisa social de abordagem qualitativa, na modalidade estrategica realizada em um hospital psiquiatrico com 39 participantes distribuidos em oito grupos focais. Foi realizada observacao do campo com registros em diario de campo. As reunioes foram gravadas e posteriormente transcritas e analisadas por meio do metodo de interpretacao de sentidos. Emergiram tres categorias tematicas que foram discutidas a luz teorica da vulnerabilidade social proposta por Robert Castel. A primeira, “descoberta do crack e outras drogas” descreve as motivacoes para o uso e diferencia a experimentacao do crack com o de outras drogas. As motivacoes citadas foram a curiosidade, excesso de liberdade dos pais e alivio para alguma decepcao da vida e, tambem a influencia de amigos. A categoria “dor do prazer” descreve o momento apos experimentacao do crack quando se instala a dependencia, levando a um ciclo de periodos curtos de tentativa de abstinencia, recaida e consumo incessante. Em suas falas, embora o crack tenha sido considerado a droga que, paradoxalmente, proporciona prazer e alivio aos sofrimentos, leva ao consumo desenfreado, fissura incontrolavel, prejuizos no trabalho, venda de bens e afastamento da familia, conflito com traficantes e policiais, independentemente, nesse estudo, de poder aquisitivo. Por ultimo, na categoria “retomar a vida” os participantes descrevem o desejo de mudanca de vida apos chegarem a uma situacao extrema de uso da droga, falta de dinheiro, conflitos em seu meio social. Apontam ainda, o sentimento de desespero por nao mais quererem usar o crack e nao serem capazes disso em virtude da dependencia. Os resultados permitiram observar que antes mesmo da dependencia do crack os participantes ja se encontravam numa situacao de vulnerabilidade social. A abordagem de pessoas em tratamento da dependencia do crack deve ser realizada no sentido de reduzir a distância entre essas pessoas e a familia, sociedade e servicos de saude, sendo esse o ponto de partida para profissionais de saude na proposicao de acoes de promocao da saude.",

      "abstract": "Background: Caffeine is added to dietary supplements to increase energy and suppress appetite. Many people take dietary supplements for weight loss. Patients may be unaware that supplements can contain caffeine, even if caffeine is not listed as an ingredient. Commonly used herbal dietary supplement ingredients, such as guarana, are natural sources of caffeine. Objective: To describe a case of possible caffeine-induced seizure in a patient taking an over-the-counter weight loss supplement. Case Report: A previously healthy 38-year-old female experienced blurring of vision and a new onset grand mal seizure. The patient had a two-month history of taking the dietary supplement, Zantrex - 3™. Zantrex - 3™ is advertised as a weight loss supplement which may provide rapid weight loss and extreme energy in one \"power packed pill.\" Conclusions/Summary: After discontinuation of Zantrex - 3™, the patient experienced no further seizure activity.

      "abstract": "The proceedings of the second annual scientific conference of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco are summarized. The goal of the annual conference was to disseminate information about ongoing nicotine research from biological, behavioral and social perspectives. Data were presented describing our current understanding of the structure and function of neuronal nicotinic acetycholine receptors, by which nicotine exerts most, if not all, of its effects in the brain. The conformational complexity of receptor subunits expressed in different brain areas contributes significantly to the complexity of responses observed to nicotinic agonists. Nicotine is being developed as a medication that might be used to maintain smoking cessation and to treat various medical diseases. The potential toxicity of nicotine, apart from cigarette smoking, is an important variable in assessing the benefits and risks of such therapeutic applications. The risks of nicotine-containing medications appear to be far less than those associated with tobacco use. Recent data indicate that cigarette smoking is increasing among youth in the United States. Adolescent smokers are interested in quitting and make frequent quit attempts, but are usually not successful. Effective methods are needed to manage adolescent smokers before they become heavily addicted. Nicotine replacement as a pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation has made a significant contribution in improving quit rates. New medications have been developed that target specific populations of smokers.",

      "abstract": "About 90% of people in Western countries use alcohol at some time in their lives, and 40% experience temporary or permanent alcohol-related impairment in some area of life as a result of drinking. Multiple sociocultural and environmental factors influence suicide rates, and thus studies conducted in one nation are not always applicable to other nations. Impulsivity and aggression are strongly implicated in suicidal behaviour. Constructs related to aggression and impulsivity confer additional risk for suicidal behaviour in people with alcohol dependence. Lower serotonin activity is tied to increased aggression/impulsivity, which in turn may enhance the probability of suicidal behaviour. Acute alcohol use is associated with suicide. Suicide completers have high rates of positive blood alcohol. Intoxicated people are more likely to attempt suicide using more lethal methods. Alcohol may be important in suicides among individuals with no previous psychiatric history. Alcohol dependence is an important risk factor for suicidal behaviour. Mood disorder is a more powerful risk factor for suicide among problem drinkers as age increases. All individuals with alcohol use disorders should be assessed for suicide, especially at the end of a binge or in the very early phase of withdrawal. Middle-age and older men with alcohol dependence and mood disorders are at particularly high risk.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hookah or waterpipe smoking or use is an emerging trend in the US population, especially among the youth. The misperception of hookah being less harmful than cigarettes and the availability of different but “appealing” flavors are considered among the main reasons for this trend. Hookah users however are exposed to many of the same toxic compounds/by-products as cigarette users, but at dramatically higher levels, which might lead to more severe negative health effects. In fact, hookah users are at risks of infections, cancers, lung disease, and other medical conditions. Moreover, because of the overlapping toxicant/chemical profile to conventional cigarettes, hookah smoke effects on the cardiovascular system are thought to be comparable to those of conventional cigarettes. A major source of tobacco addiction is nicotine, whose levels in hookah are extremely variable as they depend on the type of tobacco used. Taken together, in this review of literature, we will provide insights on the negative health effects of hookah in general, with a focus on what is known regarding its impact on the cardiovascular system.",

Frågan om cannabis är en oberoende riskfaktor för schizofreni och andra psykoser har dock varit kontroversiell och under lång tid saknades forskning på området som möjliggjorde bedömning av orsakssambanden. Under senare år har ett antal studier givit starkt stöd för att det finns ett orsakssamband mellan cannabismissbruk och senare insjuknande i schizofreni. Flera forskningsöversikter under senare år har fastslagit att cannabis med största sannolikhet är en tydlig riskfaktor för schizofreni och andra psykoser. It is well known that cannabis consumption may lead to a number of mental symptoms in direct relation to intake. Whether or not cannabis is a risk factor for schizophrenia and other psychoses is controversial and has been debated since long. Twenty years ago, we could demonstrate an association in a follow-up study of Swedish conscripts, but not until recent years has evidence accumulated from several studies worldwide. Recent reviews have concluded that there is strong evidence for cannabis is a risk factor for schizophrenia and other psychoses.Keywords: Cannabis, schizophrenia, psychosis, longitudinal studies",

      "title": "Consequences of concurrent and simultaneous amphetamine-type stimulant and alcohol use among young adults: hazardous drinking, antisocial behaviour, and contact with police",
      "abstract": "Background: Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) include ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) and methamphetamine and are the second most widely used illicit drugs in Australia, following cannabis. ATS use is most common among young adults aged 20-29 years, who often use these substances recreationally in leisure settings (e.g., nightclubs, pubs, bars, raves, music festivals, and parties). Prior research indicates that alcohol and illicit stimulants, such as ATS, are often combined in nightlife entertainment districts in the context of a big night out. The combined use of these substances represents an emerging area of concern, as evidence suggests that their combined use may result in greater harms than their separate use, including increased neurotoxicity, hazardous alcohol consumption, and aggression. However, despite the prevalence of ATS use among young adults and its use in settings in which alcohol is also prevalent, knowledge of community patterns of combined alcohol and ATS use is limited and research examining the potential consequences of combined use is scarce.Objectives: This thesis examines consequences of concurrent and simultaneous alcohol and ATS use among a population-based sample of young adult ATS users, focusing on: hazardous alcohol consumption, aggression, and contact with police.Methods: Data for this study are drawn from the Natural History Study of Drug Use (NHSDU), a prospective longitudinal study of drug use among a population-based sample of young adult ATS users and non-users in South-East Queensland, Australia. A brief drug use screening questionnaire was mailed to 12,079 young adults (aged 19-23 years) randomly selected from the Brisbane and Gold Coast electoral rolls, with a response rate of 49.9%. From this screening data, a sampling frame was developed from which an ATS-user group (used ecstasy or methamphetamine ≥3 times within the last 12 months, n=352) and a comparison group of non-users (random selection of the young adults who had never used ecstasy or methamphetamine at the time of screening, n=204) were recruited.Key findings: Study findings showed that alcohol use was prevalent among these young adult ATS users and was often used in combination with ATS. At the study baseline, 96.5% of ATS users had consumed alcohol in the last month and 92.9% of ecstasy users and 80.7% of methamphetamine users usually consumed alcohol during ecstasy and methamphetamine use episodes, respectively. Heavy episodic drinking was also common among ATS users, with 56.9% of female ATS users and 77.9% of male ATS users usually consuming >4 standard drinks on days of drinking at baseline. Findings indicated ecstasy use may play a role in the high rates of heavy episodic drinking among these young adults, with concurrent ecstasy use – though not concurrent methamphetamine use – associated with these hazardous patterns of alcohol consumption. While not associated with hazardous drinking, combined alcohol and methamphetamine use was shown to play a role in aggressive behaviour. Patterns of simultaneous alcohol and methamphetamine use were associated with both methamphetamine-attributed subjective feelings of aggression or hostility and acts of verbal and physical aggression while under the influence of illicit drugs. Lastly, for these young adults, engagement in illicit drug use, hazardous drinking, and antisocial behaviour likely puts them at an increased risk of contact with police. Findings showed that ATS users were more likely than non-using young adults to have experienced substance-related police contact and were more likely to have experienced more intensive police contact. Additionally, these findings suggest that police contact may impact on both substance use behaviours and perceptions of police and policing.Conclusions: This thesis extends current knowledge of community patterns of combined alcohol and ATS use and the potential consequences for young adults. Results highlighted that combined alcohol and ATS use is ubiquitous among these young adults. Further, this research indicates that the combined use of alcohol and ATS is associated with a number of concerning outcomes, including hazardous alcohol consumption, aggression, and contact with police, which have both health and social implications. Specifically, these findings suggest that young adult ATS users may be a key target group for alcohol interventions. Further, the policy challenges of alcohol, ATS use, and aggression among young adults need to be better considered in relation to the interlinking of these issues.",

      "title": "Effects of Nicotine on the Central Nervous System and Sleep Quality in Relation to Other Stimulants: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Nicotine is used extensively across the globe despite the common awareness of the fact that it might stimulate the neurological system in those who indulge in its consumption. Nicotine can be consumed in a wide number of various forms and can also be delivered in a wide variety of different ways. After it has been heated, it can be smoked, consumed sublingually, or brought into touch with mucosal surfaces, with the buccal mucosa being the most popular one. These three methods of consumption account for the vast majority of its use. It has been demonstrated without a reasonable doubt that people who partake in nicotine do, in fact, experience an increase in their levels of alertness, wakefulness, attention, and focus. The half-life of the substance, in addition to its effects, is highly variable depending on the forms in which it is consumed, viz. cigarettes, tobacco, gums, lozenges, and the manner in which it is administered. This is the case regardless of whether the chemical is administered orally or intravenously. It is common for a person to require multiple \"hits\" of the chemical throughout the course of the day, though the frequency of these needs and the intervals between them can vary greatly. The time interval between each of these \"hits\" can range anywhere from a few hours to a few minutes. The user has the potential to develop a tolerance to the neurostimulatory and systemic effects of nicotine, as well as a heightened sensitivity to those effects, and even hereditary predispositions to specific adverse consequences. There is also a possibility that the user will develop an addiction to nicotine. This literature review aims to explore the relationship between nicotine consumption and its effects on the central nervous system, especially on sleep.",

      "title": "THE PSYCHODYNAMICS OF THE \"DRY DRUNK\"",
      "abstract": "Our study of the responses of the 52 respondents to the questionnaire on the dry drunk leads us to the following conclusions: 1. The dry drunk is experienced by the majority of alcoholics who have maintained sobriety over a long period. 2. The occupation of an alcoholic has no statistical significance in maintaining sobriety. 3. A number of alcoholics will drink from 10 to 20 years before they begin to maintain sobriety. 4. Dry drunks generally occur within the first year of sobriety ( occasionally during the early months). 5. This symptom occurs irregularly and with diminishing intensity as the period of sobriety lengthens. 6. The dry drunk is characterized by a feeling of deep depression and frustration and by indecision regarding taking a drink. 7. \"Inner life\" is largely responsible for precipitating a dry drunk. 8. The dry drunk often is preceded by the same feelings. 9. The principal feelings after a dry drunk are relief and thankfulness at not drinking during this period of craving. 10. Drugs are not used to combat the moods and feelings of a dry drunk nor to produce similar feelings. 11. Alcoholics are irritable, restless, and impatient during a dry drunk. 12. After a dry drunk one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior return to normal. 13. A. A. members are the persons most helpful during a dry drunk while spouses, other members of the family, and former drinking companions are the least helpful. 14. Dry drunks may be prevented by contacts with A. A. and efforts to keep the mind off the drinking problem. 15. Dry drunks are generally related to one's mood swings 16. The financial status generally improves when sobriety is maintained over an extended period. 17. The dry drunks described by our respondents have a number of the same characteristics as the \" late withdrawal symptoms\" described by Wellman. We feel that this study has been useful in clarifying our thinking on the dry drunk, in indicating sources of help for persons who are experiencing or may suffer dry drunks, and in pointing out areas for further study. We are impressed with the thoughtful, painstaking way in which the questionnaires were answered and with the willingness of the respondents to elaborate in detail on their experiences.",

This phenomenon may reduce the efficacy of the substance unless dosage is increased beyond what is healthy for the individual. Restoring the effect of the substance can often be obtained by taking a break from consumption. We propose designing dosing schedules that maximize the desired effect of the substance with a given total consumption, while factoring in the effect of tolerance. We provide a simple mathematical model of response to consumption and tolerance that can be fit from data on substance administration and response. Using this model with given parameters, we determine optimal consumption schedules to maximize a given objective. We illustrate with the example of caffeine, where we provide a schedule of consumption for a user who values the effects of caffeine on all days but needs extra alertness on some days of the week.",

Hace diez o quince anos la sustancia predominante era la heroina y, aunque hoy en dia la proporcion de personas que la consumen en muy inferior a la de la cocaina, se puede afirmar que, sin que ambas dejen de estar presentes en el mundo de la drogadiccion, estan siendo desplazadas por las drogas de sintesis, experimentandose un espectacular aumento del trafico y consumo de estas sustancias.\nEn los ultimos anos el analisis de pelo ha sufrido un notable incremento debido a su utilidad para detectar el consumo de drogas durante un largo periodo de tiempo (desde semanas hasta meses o anos), frente a la informacion obtenida de otras muestras biologicas, como la sangre o la orina, que esta limitada a un periodo de tiempo mucho mas corto.

      "abstract": "Despite the well-known health risks associated with smokeless tobacco use, much is unresolved with respect to effective treatment for use of this substance. The present study examined the impact of a nicotine-free smokeless tobacco substitute and confectionary chewing gum on craving, withdrawal, and anxiety among 24 smokeless tobacco users following 24 hours of nicotine abstinence and a laboratory stressor. Although chewing gum did not impact withdrawal, craving, or anxiety compared to a no-product control condition, smokeless tobacco substitute administration resulted in a reduction of withdrawal and craving levels compared to the control condition following 24 hours of abstinence. Furthermore, significantly lower levels of craving and withdrawal were observed in both smokeless tobacco and smokeless tobacco substitute conditions compared to the control condition following the stressor. Results indicate that although general oral stimulation (eg, chewing gum) was not effective in reducing symptoms related to nicotine withdrawal, smokeless tobacco substitute use appears to be helpful in reducing withdrawal levels post-stressor. These data suggest that use of a smokeless tobacco substitute may be an effective aid in helping individuals wishing to quit, especially when managing stressors. (Am J Addict 2010;00:1-8).",

      "abstract": "Currently, drug addiction represents a phenomenon with serious medical repercussions related to the extremely important damages that it produces on our health. At the same time, the continually rising incidence and prevalence of drug consumption also make this phenomenon a serious public health problem. But, can we reduce drug addiction only to these aspects? Recent theories have made the assumption that the motivation for drug consumption can not be reduced only to the chemical properties of the drug, because there are comparative data that show that some people can become addict even from the first doses, even if they are little, whereas in the case of others the addictive behavior does not appear even in case of big doses of drug; the explanation could rely on the deep roots of this phenomenon which confers it profound social repercussions, such as social insatisfaction, socio-familial background, etc. These elements, next to the perception of society, which stigmatizes the supporters of drug consumption, marginalizes them or just disposes of them, without the possibility of any subsequent reinsertion, transform this phenomenon into a real social problem. Although drug consumption produces major damages on the physical and mental health, the voluntary demand level for specialized anti-drug treatment is extremely low compared to the number of addicts and the explanation can probably be related to this social perception which brings along the addicts’ lack of confidence in values such as confidentiality of medical information. And what if the medical personnel also have a discriminating and stigmatizing attitude in relation to this category? To what extent do drugaddicts have the same rights as the other patients and to what extent are they respected? To what extent the drug addict position itself represents a reason for discrimination in relation to the other patients? These are aspects that make drug addiction an important ethical problem.",

The use of tobacco for smoking chewing or snuffing is indulged in by millions of people throughout the world. The poisonous properties of tobacco are mainly because of the presence of nicotine a heavy oily substance. 90% of the inhaled nicotine is absorbed as against 25-50% when the smoke is drawn only into the mouth and expelled. The acute effects of tobacco (nicotine) are transitory. The chronic use of tobacco raises problems of chronic toxicity of nicotine and other constituents of tobacco smoke. The effects include nasopharyngeal and bronchial irritation lung cancer a smokers respiratory syndrome chronic bronchitis and emphysema diseases of the cardiovascular system gastrointestinal effects and other conditions.",

Ademas no parece que vaya a producirse un cambio significativo en la reduccion de uso, sino mas bien lo contrario, ya que los indices de consumo siguen incrementandose. Sin embargo, los modelos explicativos sobre el consumo de drogas ilegales son escasos. Nuestro estudio pretende paliar este deficit. Exite la necesidad de un conocimiento mas exhaustivo de los factores psicosocilaes y de los procesos que facilitan i impiden el inicio y desarrollo del consumo de esta droga ilegal para la elaboracion de programas preventivos. Evaluamos los factores de proteccion y riesgo asociados al consumo de cannabis utilizando como muestra a los alumnos de la facultade de Psicologia de la Universidad de Granada. Encontramos que el 42% de la poblacion estudiada ha consumido cannabis. Los estudiantes que se inician en el uso de cannabis sulen ser de genero masculino, no tienen pareja estable, trabajan esporadicamente, sus padres no conviven juntos y tienen modelos proximos (padres, hermanos y amigos) que consumen distintas drogas, donde hermanos y amigos ejercen una mayor influencia. Los resultados obtenidos pueden explicarse de acuerdo a la teoria de la Hipotesis de la Puerta (kandel, 2003; Kandel y Jessor, 2002), ya que descubrimos, con una muestra espanola, una secuencia de consumo. Los estudiante se inician en el uso de alcohol, seguidamente de tabaco y, despues de consumir estas drogas legales, comienzan con el uso de sustancias pertenecientes a fases mas tempranas en la secuencia incrementa el riesgo de consumir drogas posteriores en la cadena. Pese a ello, la confirmacion en el desarrollo de estas etapas no implica que las fases sean obligatorias o univesales, ni que todas las personas progresen en la secuencia (Kandel, 2002). Por ello, en este trabajo investigamos tambien la relacion que otras variables, como las protectoras, el estres percibido o el afronta",

      "title": "Nicotine dependence among workers: Is it a time for smoke-free workplaces!",
      "abstract": "The adverse effects of smoking, a chronic relapsing disease, have been recognized at least since 1604.[1] Even after understanding the risks of smoking or smokeless tobacco, and also the benefits of smoking cessation, for both general and specialized physicians, smoking cessation is not on priority. Smoking or chewing tobacco is viewed as a part of lifestyle and moreover a habit which continues despite its hazardous consequences. Almost all smokers begin smoking in very adolescence under influence of numerous social factors which include mimicking of family members and friends in circle, promotion through advertising and public images, as a status symbol in society, and some get the feel of macho man via smoking. Easy accessibility and low cost of raw tobacco products also contribute to overuse of nicotine and its products. In India, 20% of total tobacco consumption is through cigarette smoking as compared to bidi smoking which accounts for around 40% of total tobacco consumption.[2] Smokeless tobacco use in the form of gutkha is also highly prevalent in countries such as India. Stressful life, workplace stress, and nature of work also influence smoking behavior of an individual. John et al.[3] studied a community sample of Northern German area and observed that higher work strain was associated with stronger relation with Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Migration in search of job from rural areas also influences the smoking behavior. Cui et al.[4] categorically demonstrated that rural-urban migrant workers manifested a high prevalence of stress in both life and work. Both forms of stress showed association with current smoking and life stress was found to outweigh the impact of work stress. The sidestream smoke also called secondhand smoke is also harmful. Many studies till now have clearly demonstrated the association between exposure to secondhand smoke at home or at work and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which may also be a dose-dependent phenomenon. Therefore, smoking at workplaces not only harms the individual smoker but also puts his/her coworkers at risk of developing harmful hazards of smoking. A study recently done in Delhi by Prashar et al.[5] and published in this issue titled, \"Prevalence and correlates of nicotine dependence among construction site workers\" raises at least three issues, namely, (i) is tobacco chewing safer than smoking, (ii) place of FTND in smokers, (iii) will smoke-free workplace help in this regard ? The authors have found more numbers of tobacco chewers than smokers in their study. Both forms have nicotine as primary substrate responsible for addiction. Three to four times more nicotine is absorbed from chewing tobacco than smoking cigarette. It has higher risk of developing oral cancers apart from other known local effects in the oral cavity. However, the absence of sidestream smoke with this form prevents others from passive smoke exposure. The authors have correlated various risk factors associated with a relatively high prevalence of smoking and tobacco use at workplaces. They have also been able to demonstrate that majority of their study population (78%) started smoking because of peer pressure, again supporting the role of workplace stress in commencement of tobacco use. Tobacco users have varying degree of nicotine dependence. Nicotine being most important psychologically active drug in tobacco causes addiction similar to heroin and cocaine. Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ) is a simple and widely used paper and pencil test of nicotine dependence and correlates with other proposed measures of nicotine dependence (carbon monoxide, nicotine, and cotinine level). Recently revised version of FTQ, the FTND is as reliable as FTQ and has somewhat higher internal consistency.[6] The authors of the present study have used this test to assess nicotine dependence in their study population and reported 51% of them being moderate to severe dependent. Moreover, 60% of themselves found it difficult to refrain from smoking or chewing tobacco in public places; further supporting the fact that FTND may also predict the outcome with nicotine replacement as a function of dose. Worksite tobacco control initiatives face a crucial challenge. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is only one of options to quit smoking. Provisions of smoke-free workplaces are an area of debate from erstwhile and difficult to implement. However, does it work? A systematic review of smoke-free policies to reduce tobacco use by Hopkins et al.[7] has identified strong evidence of effectiveness of smoking bans and restriction in reducing environmental (secondhand) tobacco smoke, reduced tobacco use among workers with added economic benefits. Another study by Michael and Stanton compared the cost-effectiveness of NRT with state-wide smoke-free workplaces. They found that smoke-free workplace policies are about 9 times more cost effective than free NRT program and opined that it should be a public health funding policy even when the primary goal is to promote individual smoke cessation.[8] David and Lois studied the motivational characteristics of smokers at workplace and revealed that <8% of the employed smokers were ready to quit smoking.[9] Given the multiple risks of smoking and smokeless tobacco use, it is imperative that successful comprehensive programs are needed to be developed to protect and promote the health and quality life of workers.",

      "title": "Playing with Propranolol",
      "abstract": "When an anxiety-reducing drug with virtually no side effects is used to enhance performance, is that cheating? Is it drug abuse? Is it an admission of professional weakness? During a series of three performances, a trumpet player in a professional orchestra consistently plays a difficult solo passage flawlessly each time. Her colleague in trumpet section marvels at her ability to play so well, since he knows that he and other professional players are unlikely ever to play that particular passage with consistent perfection. His assessment of his colleague's luck and talent changes, however, when he learns she takes ten milligrams of drug propranolol before each performance that requires her to play difficult solo passages. Although many people will agree on what constitutes ethical and unethical use of certain types of drugs, some kinds of drug use do not fit easily into either category. The patient who demands an antibiotic for a viral head cold, athlete who requests steroids to enhance his or her performance, or child who receives growth hormone injections because of a perceived social advantage to being tall present instances of drug use that are difficult to evaluate from a moral perspective. Propranolol for performance anxiety represents another instance of ethical ambiguity in regard to drug use. The reason for such ambiguity is that ethical evaluation of drug use is shaped by cultural beliefs and values, many of which lie hidden in commonsensical, unquestioned assumptions we make about our world. These implicit meanings, when they surface, often are in form of vague images and incompletely articulated ideas. Furthermore, cultural images may have competing and contradictory meanings that add to ambiguity of a moral evaluation of drugs and their use. Propranolol use by musicians is an interesting case study for several reasons. It is a drug that can enhance one's performance and may increase one's advantage in competitive field of performing arts. As such, its use gives rise to moral questions similar to those raised by use of steroids by athletes, such as fairness, or harm to individual.[1] In addition, ambiguity about meaning of performance anxiety and propranolol use complicates moral issues. Is performance anxiety a normal phenomenon, as most musicians believe? At what point does it become pathological? Does fact that physicians prescribe propranolol to treat performance anxiety confer upon it status of disease? Or does fact that musicians often obtain this prescription drug from their friends and take it before any important performance constitute simply another form of drug abuse? Propranolol and Performance Anxiety Performance anxiety, or stage fright, has been defined as the experience of persisting, distressful apprehension about and/or actual impairment of, performance skills in a public context, to a degree unwarranted given individual's musical aptitude, training, and level of preparation.[2] Propranolol is a prescription drug increasingly used by symphony and opera musicians to eliminate symptoms of performance anxiety. The drug was first introduced for treatment of angina pectoris, and later used to treat cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension and to prevent sudden death after myocardial infarction. Propranolol use was later extended to treat migraine headaches and symptoms of anxiety associated with stress.[3] When a person is under stress, sympathetic nervous system produces adrenaline-like chemicals that attach to beta-adrenergic receptor sites of body. These sites produce physiological responses in heart rate, skeletal muscles, blood vessels, and bronchioles of lungs and, in essence, prepare body for a fight or flight reaction. Propranolol and other beta-blocking drugs compete with adrenaline-like chemicals for these sites on cells and block their physiological effects. …",

      "abstract": "Use of the electronic cigarette or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) is increasing globally. Its vapour delivers nicotine without the 6000 odd chemicals released during cigarette smoking and the associated harm. Experts are divided on whether ENDS promise reduction in tobacco use or threaten tobacco control. This review presents up-to-date evidence. Two trials showed an increase in cessation, but not a reduction in cigarette use. Eight cohort studies showed no increase in cessation, and two cohort studies and a recent trial showed an increased reduction in cigarette use. A US population study showed association between ENDS use and smoking cessation. Nicotine addiction and potential harm to non-smokers who use ENDS are key concerns. Nicotine affects lung and brain development. An increase in accidental poisoning, though mild, is reported in children. No significant short term health effects are reported. When heated, ENDS may emit potential toxic and carcinogenic substances such as aldehydes, acrolein, flavouring agents etc. at very low levels - but their long term impact is not known. ENDS bring potential benefits to smokers, but there are concerns about their potential for nicotine addiction, gateway effect and renormalisation of smoking. However, in the UK and the US, a rise in ENDS use is associated with a fall in the prevalence of smoking. Countries differ in their approach to ENDS. India seems to be edging towards a total ban. India should collect local data and conduct research to monitor the impact and make informed, evidence based decisions, where needed.",

      "abstract": "Objective\r\n\r\nThe fear of weight gain appears to be a barrier to quitting in some smokers, particularly in women. However, not all female smokers have the same concerns about weight, and not all quitters are equally susceptible to gaining weight after cessation. We hypothesized that among females, dieters, compared to nondieters, would report more weight gain after smoking cessation and would tend to smoke more for weight control purposes. Method: Undergraduate college students were surveyed to assess their smoking status, dieting status, postcessation weight gain, and their motivations to smoke. Results: Among former smokers, dieters reported considerably more weight gain than nondieters.

      "abstract": "Objective The fear of weight gain appears to be a barrier to quitting in some smokers, particularly in women. However, not all female smokers have the same concerns about weight, and not all quitters are equally susceptible to gaining weight after cessation. We hypothesized that among females, dieters, compared to nondieters, would report more weight gain after smoking cessation and would tend to smoke more for weight control purposes. Method: Undergraduate college students were surveyed to assess their smoking status, dieting status, postcessation weight gain, and their motivations to smoke. Results: Among former smokers, dieters reported considerably more weight gain than nondieters. Dieters were more likely to have started, and to have continued smoking in order to control their weight, and among current smokers, dieters reported having had shorter quit attempts.

Uno de los principios activos de la mariguana es el Δ9-tetrahidrocannabinol. Esta molécula afecta al sistema endocannabinoide, provocando cambios en su función y, concomitantemente, en la morfología cerebral. Objetivo: revisar y discutir la evidencia científica del efecto del consumo de mariguana sobre el cerebro, la inteligencia y la toma de decisiones. Método: se consideraron los reportes científicos que abarcan de 2005 a marzo de 2016 encontrados en PubMed, enfocados en los efectos del consumo de mariguana sobre cambios morfológicos cerebrales, la inteligencia y la toma de decisiones. Resultados: dependiendo de la edad de inicio del consumo de mariguana, es posible detectar cambios en el cerebro y la inteligencia, mientras que otras variables como la frecuencia o la cantidad de uso repercuten en la eficiencia para la toma de decisiones. Discusión y conclusiones: estos resultados señalan que 1) el consumo de mariguana afecta la morfología cerebral, la toma de decisiones y la inteligencia; 2) sugieren la potencial participación del sistema endocannabinoide en la toma de decisiones e inteligencia; y 3) dadas las consecuencias, deben alertar al sector salud para promover su prevención y en su momento estar preparados para la rehabilitación.",

      "title": "S2864 Pill-Induced Esophagitis Secondary to Caffeine Pills",
      "abstract": "Introduction: In the United States, over 80% of Americans report using caffeine daily. Amongst the military population, caffeine use for its stimulant effects has been commonplace and even encouraged for decades. Studies have demonstrated that caffeine can counter the cognitive deficits seen with sleep deprivation, notably improving attention, vigilance, and reaction time. While caffeine is overall very safe, ingestion of high doses typically in the form of caffeine pills can result in deleterious side effects. Although the primary concern is development of cardiac arrhythmias, damage to the esophageal mucosa is a rare yet clinically significant occurrence. We present a case of severe pill esophagitis in a 19-year-old active-duty military member. Case Description/Methods: A 19-year-old man presented with headache, abdominal pain, and nausea following a suicide attempt with consumption of ∼7,300mg of caffeine. Medical history was unremarkable and he denied any daily medications or supplements. Vital signs and electrocardiogram were normal. Physical exam was significant for a holosystolic murmur and mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Labs were significant for hypokalemia, and an elevated creatine kinase of 4,103 U/L. Acetaminophen level and urine drug screen were negative. On hospital-day 3 the patient developed worsening epigastric pain and decreased appetite. Computed topography imaging showed circumferential esophageal wall thickening concerning for esophagitis. Gastroenterology was consulted and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed showing severe Los Angeles (LA) Class D erosive damage extending from the gastro-esophageal junction to the proximal esophagus (Figure 1). Pathology findings were consistent with pill-induced esophagitis and the patient showed clinical improvement after treatment with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Discussion: Caffeine has been widely researched as a stimulant and there is no evidence to support any adverse health effects when consumed in moderation (up to 400mg/day). Although dangerous levels are not well established, ingestion of >10 g/day is generally considered a toxic dose. Fatality from caffeine is rare with the most common cause of death being ventricular fibrillation. If consumed in pill form as is common in the military and shift work populations, it is important to realize the potential risk of pill-induced esophagitis. If encountered, this should be managed with a PPI until symptom resolution.Figure 1.: A: Esophagitis in the mid esophagus. B: LA Class D esophagitis at the gastroesophageal junction.",

      "abstract": "The intake of alcoholic beverages is a huge social issue. Worldwide, an estimated 2.3 billion individuals consume alcohol, with an average daily consumption of 33 grammes of pure alcohol. Self-esteem is a measure of one’s self-awareness and sense of personal worth. The process of behaving and then thinking about acts, as well as how others interpret actions, shapes one’s self-perception. Self-esteem refers to how we feel about ourselves and how much we regard ourselves. Alcoholism has far-reaching consequences and might result in mental health issues. One of the most typical effects found in alcoholics is the development of poor self-esteem. This term refers to a person’s total subjective sentiments of personal worth and value. It has a wide range of effects. It has an impact on a variety aspect of life, including substance abuse and recovery. The majority of alcoholics have a low sense of self-esteem. They have struggled to cope with their lives and frequently have significant emotional, family, social, and occupational issues, as well as financial, legal, and sexual issues. Coping is frequently studied in terms of its potential to reduce negative consequences. Coping skills can also help you achieve more favourable results.",

The health effects of low versus moderate to high chronic tobacco consumption in comparison with no smoking; 2. The health effects reducing chronic high, moderate or low smoking while maintaining some use versus quitting. This document provides some answers to the following questions: Q1. Is chronic low tobacco smoking (loose leaf tobacco, cigarettes) associated with: a) an accrued mortality and morbidity versus no smoking; b) a lesser risk of mortality and morbidity versus chronic moderate or high consumption? Q2.1. Is decreased chronic consumption associated with reduced mortality of morbidity versus stable consumption? Q2.2. Is the mortality and morbidity risk associated with reduced consumption similar to that of quitting? This literature review, based on original articles from powerful cohort studies with long follow-up periods, shows the following results: Q1a. Even low chronic consumption (0 15 cpd) may benefit from a slight risk reduction if they decrease consumption, probably due to an excessive risk from the outset. However, there is insufficient proof to say whether the reduced incidence of lung cancer is associated with reduced rates of all- cause mortality.",

Nicotine dependence among smokers is variable, and in some cases, fails to develop even after years of smoking. This variation can influence treatment outcome and presents a challenge to treatment developers. Gender differences are evident sometimes in smoking prevalence, in smoking cessation, and smoking rate. Gender, however, may be a superficial indicator; reasons for smoking, individual reactions to nicotine, and cultural sanctions and role definitions may be more influential. Analyses of individual differences should focus on identifying the underlying processes that control smoking behavior.",

It can improve both mood and cognitive functioning; these positive effects are strong reinforcements for smokers and contribute to their addiction. Opposite results also have been reported, however, and the effects of nicotine remain controversial. Recent epidemiological and empirical studies have indicated that smoking or nicotine or both may have protective effects against certain diseases. These findings have suggested that nicotine may be used as a therapeutic agent. However, because a variety of nicotinic cholinergic receptors are present in the brain, new agonist compounds may prove to be more effective than nicotine for therapeutic purposes. Studies are reviewed and the suggestion made that nicotine may prove useful as a tool to help us understand normal and pathological brain functioning.",

Among the substances that may abused are alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, sedatives, cocaine, amphetamines, and marijuana. Any adult may legally purchase some substances, whereas others are illegal for most people or are available only by prescription. Although mild or moderate substance use may be harmless and even beneficial to one’s health, substance abuse presents a host of health and safety concerns for individuals and society at large (it is associated with crime and traffic accidents, for example). Human services practitioners must be able to assess clients for substance-use disorders and have knowledge of their available treatments. These treatments include psychoeducational interventions, which are especially relevant for those substance abusers who are reluctant to engage in traditional therapies. Alcohol-related disorders are the primary focus of this chapter, although other substances will be addressed as well.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is found in a variety of beverages such as soda, coffee, and tea, which are consumed by many people on a daily basis. Because of how commonly caffeine is consumed, it is important to discover the effects adolescent caffeine consumption may have on adult addiction behaviors. A rat model was used to explore the potential effects of adolescent caffeine consumption. Rats consumed caffeine during their adolescent period and underwent behavioral tests in adulthood to assess whether they displayed behaviors associated with enhanced vulnerability to drug addiction. Behavioral tests used to assess addictive behaviors in adulthood included drug self-administration (SA) and a Pavlovian Conditioned Approach (PCA) task. Our findings show that rats that consume caffeine during adolescence self-administer cocaine in adulthood at a higher rate than controls. Rats consuming caffeine during adolescence also have a higher breakpoint for cocaine self-administration in adulthood than controls, indicating that adolescent caffeine consumption increases motivation for drug taking. We also found that a greater percentage of rats consuming caffeine during early adolescence displayed “sign-tracking” behaviors during the PCA task that has been associated with altered dopamine signaling and correlated with increased drug self-administration. While the results were not as clear, a similar trend was also seen in rats that consumed caffeine during their late adolescent period. Overall, these findings illustrate that adolescent caffeine consumption enhances addictive behaviors in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Some drugs make people feel good. That is why some people use them. Some of these drugs are alleged to have side effects so destructive that many advise against their use. The same may be said about statutes that attempt to prohibit the manufacture, sale, and use of drugs. Advocating drug prohibition makes some people feel good because they think they are “doing something” about what they believe to be a serious social problem. Others who support these laws are not so altruistically motivated. Employees of law enforcement bureaus and academics who receive government grants to study drug use, for example, may gain financially from drug prohibition. But as with using drugs, using drug laws can have moral and practical side effects so destructive that they argue against ever using legal institutions in this manner. One might even say—and not altogether metaphorically—that some people become psychologically or economically addicted to drug laws. That is, some people continue to support these statutes despite the massive and unavoidable ill",

      "title": "Alcohol consumption among adolescents in the City of Zagreb and the presence of alcohol drinking among their parents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdolescence is a period in which majority of youth first come into contact with psychoactive substances. For some, this contact is ephemeral and without major consequences, while for others it can be fatal and lead to a complete change of lifestyle and development of addiction. Alcohol is a psychoactive substance that most adolescents consume. This is, besides its legality and availability, due to its eternal presence and incorporation into lifestyle and customs. Adolescents are not attracted by alcohol only because of the identification with the lifestyle of adults, but also as a means to temporarily take away the anxiety associated with feelings of being lost and confused in their current life phase. Alcohol consumption in adolescence is usually characterized with daily need for drinking, and often, intensive drinking on weekends. Experimenting with addictive substances among youth is usually motivated with curiosity, a desire for self-affirmation, imitation and self-assertion. As with adults, alcohol consumption among young people can stimulate and/or be accompanied by a number of other psychiatric disorders.1 With adolescents prone to alcohol use and general psychoactive substances, we can frequently observe behavior disorders, origins of antisocial and borderline personality disorder and mood disorders. These disorders may induce the use of psychoactive substances and lead to a behavioral model characterized by impulsivity, self destructive tendencies and disregard for the consequences of their actions.2-5Previous studies have suggested a number of factors that influence the use of psychoactive substances, such as the structure of adolescent personality, family dynamics, genetics and neurochemical and social factors. Due to the complex interaction of these factors it is difficult to determine the hierarchy of their importance in the development and preferences to alcohol consumption.6-9 Considering the important, if not the most important role that family has in the formation of identity in adolescence10 it is to be expected that the family functioning would be associated with general psychic adjustment of adolescents, their perception of self-esteem, a sense of competence, school achievement and behavioral disorders - delinquent behavior and use of addictive substances.11-13Early psychoanalytic theories made reference to oral regression and the similarity of the phenomenon of addiction with the earliest stage of libidinal development, when the child demands gratification of its desires without any ability to give. Addictive behavior is understood as a narcissistic phenomenon of obsession with achieving personal satisfaction. Recent theories describe dysfunction of the ego, the inability of processing painful and unpleasant feelings related to early object relations, while the cognitive approach attempts to identify negative models of thought related with the experience of adolescent identity confusion, lifestyle, projections of their future, relationship with their parents and peers, with the inability to develop different cognitive schemes. Some studies have shown that, among adolescents who are prone to consuming psychoactive substances the traits of pessimism, impulsiveness, auto-aggression and low self-esteem are more accentuated.2'4SUBJECTS AND METHODSThis study was conducted on 701 high school students in Zagreb during the school year 2011/2012. Selection included 13 general secondary school classes and 18 vocational high school classes. In each school, students engaged in the study came from 1st to 4th grade or, for vocational schools, 1st to 3rd grade. After attaining a written permission of the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports, the directors of schools in which the study was conducted were informed on the implementation of research and parents of students in selected classes were sent a notification in which the objectives, methods and modus of research were briefly explained. …",

      "abstract": "Despite the prohibition against cannabis which exists in most Australian States and Territories, 44 per cent of males and 35 per cent of females have used the drug at least once in their lifetime. Use of the drug has increased in the last few years, prompting some to argue that the prohibition against cannabis is both costly and ineffective, and should be lifted. The present research was designed to assess the influence of prohibition on young people who have never used cannabis or who have not used it in the last 12 months. It was also designed to assess some of the potential effects of lifting the prohibition against cannabis use. The study results suggest that the illegal status of cannabis does act to limit its use. However, fear of arrest, fear of imprisonment, the cost of cannabis or its availability do not appear to exert much effect on the prevalence of cannabis use, although they may exert some restraining effect on cannabis consumption among frequent cannabis users.",

The continuing growth of youthful smoking and other substance use is often explained by appeal to global psychological variables such as self- esteem, where the young smoker is assumed to smoke, drink, or take drugs to compensate for low levels of self-esteem. This paper sets out a brief critique of the deployment of 'self-esteem' as a global variable in understanding adolescent smoking, and argues for a more complex vision of self-identity as a means of connecting young people's ideas about themselves with their concrete health behaviours.",

In fact, Magic drinks can be very dangerous, even for life, if we use them more than is declared /1- 2 on day/, especially if it is consumed with alcohol, because of the permanent rise of adrenaline level. The aim of our article is to present a case of a nineteen-year-old boy, which resulted in arrhythmia due to consumption of considerable amounts of alcohol and energy drink Guarana. Atrial fibrillation and ventricular exstrasistoly, were successfully medicated. All diagnostic examinations /Lab., RTG/PC, Doppler echocardiography, lung function examination, thyroid gland examination/did not show any pathomorphologic substrate. Registered arrhythmias and facts found in literature, lead to conclusion that rhythm disorder is caused because of hyperadrenergic condition in case of consumption energy with alcohol.",

      "title": "Promise of nicotinic‐based therapeutic treatments",
      "abstract": "Abstract Nicotine has a wide variety of pharmacological effects. Some of these, such as improved attentiveness and memory, quickened reaction time, reduced appetite, and lessening of stress can be viewed as beneficial and may partially underlie tobacco use. They also suggest therapeutic uses of nicotine. Like any drug, nicotine has adverse effects as well, such as convulsant actions and cardiovascular effects. Also, like a variety of therapeutic drugs from caffeine to codeine, nicotine has the adverse potential to become habit forming or addictive. Many of the health damaging effects of tobacco use, such as cancer and lung disease, seem to result from compounds present in tar. Eliminating the more than 4,000 different compounds present in tar goes a long way in reducing adverse effects associated with nicotine intake. When developing nicotine for therapeutic use, it is critical to determine the mechanisms of its actions so that its beneficial effects can be maximized and its adverse effects can be minimized. This might be achieved with alternate routes of delivery of nicotine such as the skin patch or with novel nicotinic ligands currently under development. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

They typically contain carbohydrate, caffeine, and other nutrients purported to enhance mental and/or physical performance. Additionally, several caffeine-containing pre-workout supplements have been developed which are commonly consumed as a drink prior to and/or during exercise. While occasional ingestion of these types of products appears to be safe and may offer some ergogenic benefit, individuals who consume these products indiscriminately need to be careful and consider how ingestion of these products may affect the total daily intake of caffeine and other stimulants throughout the day, to minimize any adverse events and/or harmful side effects. This review provides an update as to the current literature on energy drinks and energy shots and provides practical recommendations for their appropriate use among athletes.

      "abstract": "Any substance that humans consume has some sort of psychological effect upon them. Generally, most people seek out the ones that can elicit feelings of comfort, pleasure, or the sense of improving one's health. Yet, some individuals seek out various substances to dull one's senses or to rouse them. Alcohol and caffeine can serve those purposes perfectly well. Together, the effects of caffeine and alcohol may have some impact upon the mind and behavior, which may be positive or negative. While the consumption of either type of drink in subsequent usage is not a new concept, the mixing of both beverages is a newer phenomenon, and the noticeable effects are causing physicians, health officials, and law and policymakers take notice and take action. Due to the newness of the concept, research upon the subject is only in its burgeoning stages, yet it is sure to develop subsequent studies in due time based upon its generation of consumers. An entire industry of caffeinated alcoholic beverages (CABs) has arisen in recent years, primarily targeting college-aged individuals and has seen widespread success among this population. This chapter will examine the psychological effects of alcohol and caffeine, who are the most likely users, its safety and health implications, current legislation in place and developing policy, and what the future of this type of consumption can have in coming years.",

An example of this is to be found in the injudicious use of various medications. There are those who recognize that their lives are abnormally stressful but find themselves unable to cope at all, and these are the ones who tend to resort to medications in an effort to seek relief. Seeking pharmacological relief from stress is not new.

Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion.

      "title": "Determinants of Food Choice: Relationships with Obesity and Weight Control",
      "abstract": "Abstract The decision to eat, and to eat particular foods, varies for different individuals and situations. Individual differences in food likes and desires develop throughout life because of differing food experiences and attitudes. There are many internal and external cues, not just stimulation from foods or hunger, which can trigger the immediate desire to eat or orient eating toward certain foods. Food desires and intake are an outcome of interactions between these cues and more stable individual physiological and psychological characteristics. Overweight and obese individuals show a tendency toward greater liking and selection of energy‐dense foods, which may contribute to development and maintenance of these conditions. However, although liking (pleasure from eating) is an important part of food choice, it may make only a modest contribution to overall variation in food choice and eating behaviors. Indeed, difficulties of weight control may reflect problems with cues and motivations to eat, rather than with heightened pleasure derived from eating. Paradoxically, individuals highly concerned with food intake and weight control may be particularly susceptible to thoughts, emotions, and situational cues that can prompt overeating and undermine their attempts to restrain eating. Repeat dieting, high day‐to‐day fluctuations in intakes, and attempts to enforce highly rigid control over eating all seem to be counterproductive to weight control efforts and may disrupt more appropriate food choice behaviors. Longer‐term weight maintenance solutions and programs that offer a degree of structuring of the personal food environment, while retaining flexibility in choices, therefore, may be particularly beneficial in weight management.",

      "title": "The ‘Not-a-Puff’ rule",
      "abstract": "The ‘not-a-puff’ rule involves assisting smokers to stop smoking abruptly, commit to not smoking any further cigarettes after the quit date and also to promise to not taking even a single puff on a cigarette from that day forwards. This briefing provides the rationale and the theoretical and empirical evidence behind this clinical intervention. The traditional definition of a four-week quit used for stop smoking service returns to the Department of Health is ‘continuous abstinence from smoking from day 14 to the four-week follow-up point’. This means that occasional smoking is permitted in the first two weeks of the quit attempt but should NOT be interpreted clinically that this is a strategy that is encouraged. Better long-term results are obtained from abrupt cessation and adoption of the ‘not-a-puff’ rule. Continued smoking following the quit date prevents resolution of the neuroadaptive changes in the brain that take place upon quitting and leads to prolonged withdrawal symptoms. The ‘habit’ element of smoking is not broken whilst a smoker continues to have occasional puffs. Smoking following the quit date reduces the client’s self-efficacy, which only increases through\r\ncontinued abstinence. Self-control, also valuable in quitting, is similarly related to the length of time a client abstains and will not build up if the client continues to smoke. Empirical studies have shown that lapses are commonly followed by relapses, in up to 95%\r\nof cases. The ‘not-a-puff’ rule is associated with better outcomes than gradual cessation, in both supported\r\nand unsupported quit attempts. Harm reduction, where continued smoking is permitted with concomitant use of pharmacotherapy (i.e. nicotine replacement therapy; NRT) to reduce consumption, can be recommended for smokers\r\nwho are unwilling or unable to stop.",

As substance use and abuse continues to ravage communities, researchers remain in the dark about what works to ensure successful recovery from addiction. In searching for the answers, researchers have often overlooked the role of religious and spiritual practices and beliefs in preventing use and relapse. The study reported here describes the process of spiritual awakenings experienced by some persons in recovery during their quest for sobriety. The data suggests that persons in recovery often undergo life altering transformations as a result of embracing a power higher than one's self, that is, a Higher Power. The result is often an intense spiritual journey that leads to sustained abstinence. Given how widespread substance abuse is, research on the nature, implications, and limitations of a spiritual approach to addiction might offer new options for treatment.",

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-operated devices that produce a vapour consisting of nicotine (although some are nicotine-free), propylene glycol or glycerol, and flavourings.E-cigarettes were invented in 2003 in China and entered the United States and European markets in 2006 [1].Hence, it is obvious that no observational data on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes exist as yet.Data on the health consequences of chronic nicotine exposure is available from studies in prolonged users of nicotine replacement products [2].These data do not suggest that chronic nicotine exposure increases cardiopulmonary or cancer risk.Toxic and carcinogenic compounds may be found in e-cigarettes, but in trace amounts that are much lower than levels found in conventional cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not expose the user to most of the constituents of cigarette smoke at concentrations that are responsible for many of the tobacco-attributable diseases.Therefore, most experts believe that inhaling e-cigarette vapour is less harmful than inhaling cigarette smoke.The limited available evidence suggests a potential for e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool and/or an instrument for reducing conventional cigarette use (harm reduction concept) [3].During the past few years e-cigarettes have gained popularity, primarily among smokers who want to reduce the risk of smoking [4].The paper from Guillet S. et al. [5] adds some information about the perception and the use of ecigarettes.The authors performed a cross-sectional survey in 2013 among 300 students and instructors of the French school of military paramedical personnel using self-administered questionnaires.They found a prevalence of smoking among the 200 responders of 40%, which is higher than in the general French population.In tobacco smokers the observed e-cigarette lifetime use prevalence was 57% and was close to the 50% of smokers observed in the general population.However, the daily use prevalence was much lower, at 4% in the study population and 3% in the French population.The motivation for e-cigarette use in smokers was the intention to reduce tobacco consumption in 43% and to quit smoking in 8%.But almost half of the responders reported a decrease in tobacco consumption following e-cigarette initiation (average decrease of 5 to 10 cigarettes).Only about half of all respondents, smokers and nonsmokers, perceived e-cigarettes as being less harmful than tobacco.A 30-to 40-times higher number of adults (age ≥18 years) were surveyed in the US [6].This annual consumer-based web survey comprised 6 555 persons in 2010-2011 and 8 173 between 2012-2013.Among smokers, an increase in",

      "abstract": "Background: Majority people with schizophrenia who smoke cigarettes, tend to be heavy smokers than other psychiatric patients and general population. Nicotine is one of the main components of cigarettes that can produce nicotinic interactions with antipsychotic drugs. Nicotine can also alleviate psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Aim: The objective for this systematic review is to examine the effects of nicotine and nicotine-based products in the treatment of schizophrenia, in comparison with placebo, no treatment or antipsychotic medication. Results: All studies comparing nicotine or other related products as the only treatment or adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia patients excluding the animal studies and case studies are reviewed. The use of traditional or known as typical antipsychotics may cause the patients to smoke frequently while patients taking atypical antipsychotics may smoke less. Patients who smoke may metabolize antipsychotics faster than non-smoking patients. There is less report related to smoking cessation among the schizophrenia patients. Conclusion: Neurobiological and psychosocial factors reinforce the high use of nicotine by patients with schizophrenia. Prior to smoking cessation implementation, it is crucial to understand on the ways and reasons for schizophrenia patients to consume nicotine for self-medicate symptoms which may lead to the development of new treatments for schizophrenia and nicotine dependence.

      "abstract": "In India as well as globally smoking is a serious social and public health problem. Tobacco use is one of the biggest social and public health issues in India and around the world. In India, there are plenty of options for smoking and smokeless tobacco, including jarda, pan masala, gutka, bidi, and cigarettes. Every year, tobacco usage claims the lives of almost six millions individuals globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tobacco smoking caused 100 million premature deaths worldwide in the 20th century. If present tobacco use rates continue, this number is predicted to climb to 1 billion in India in the 21st century. For a variety of reasons, including peer pressure, stress, alleviation, sadness, and social media ads advocating smoking, people begin to smoke or chew tobacco. The lower socioeconomic classes like and prefer tobacco more than other drugs because it is more affordable and readily available. One tobacco addicted patient tried to quit chewing tobacco, but as withdrawal symptoms, he reported having headaches, indigestion, anorexia, anxiety and body aches. The patient was treated with powder of Punarnava (Boerhavia diffusa Linn.), Sheerisha( Albizzia lebbeck L.) and Sarpagandha (Rauwolfia serpentine L.) ghana vati for his withdrawal symptoms. These are dravya’s from Ekasara gana which helps patient to feel better by reducing their withdrawal symptoms and signs of tobacco dependence.",

Επιπλέον, σε πληθυσμούς με προβλήματα κατάχρησης, περιγράφεται ότι άτομα με κατάχρηση οινοπνεύματος που απευθύνθηκαν σε θεραπευτικές υπηρεσίες, είχαν κάνει σε υψηλά ποσοστά και χρήση κοκαΐνης, κατά τη διάρκεια του προηγούμενου έτους, ενώ επίσης αρκετά συχνά χρήστες κοκαΐνης χρησιμοποιούν το οινόπνευμα για να μετριάσουν το αίσθημα δυσφορίας από την απόσυρση της κοκαΐνης (κρακ). Αρκετές μελέτες διερευνούν το φαρμακολογικό αποτέλεσμα της παράλληλης χρήσης κοκαΐνης και οινοπνεύματος, όπου και η σειρά χορήγησης των ουσιών φαίνεται ότι επηρεάζει τη φαρμακοκινητική τους. Σε ταυτόχρονη χρήση ή χρήση κοκαΐνης λίγο μετά τη χρήση οινοπνεύματος, προκύπτει αύξηση του επιπέδου κοκαΐνης στο πλάσμα σε ποσοστό ως και 30 %, διπλασιασμός του επιπέδου νορκοκαΐνης στον ορό και δημιουργία κοκα-αιθυλένης στο πλάσμα. Ο σχηματισμός κοκα-αιθυλένης φαίνεται ότι ισχύει ακόμη και όταν το οινόπνευμα έπεται της χρήσης κοκαΐνης κατά 30 λεπτά, αλλά τα ποσοστά σχηματισμού της ουσίας παρουσιάζουν διακύμανση, σύμφωνα με τη βιβλιογραφία. Η κοκα-αιθυλένη έχει 3-5 φορές μεγαλύτερο χρόνο ημίσειας ζωής στο πλάσμα συγκριτικά με την κοκαΐνη, παρόμοια συμπεριφορικά και τοξικολογικά χαρακτηριστικά, αλλά η βραδύτερη αποβολή της από τον οργανισμό, που έχει σαν αποτέλεσμα την εντονότερη τοξίκωση, έχει σε διάφορες μελέτες συσχετισθεί με επιληπτικές κρίσεις, ηπατική βλάβη, επιβάρυνση της λειτουργίας του ανοσοποιητικού συστήματος και συγκριτικά με την κοκαΐνη 18-25 φορές αύξηση του σχετικού κινδύνου αιφνιδίου θανάτου, σε άτομα με ισχαιμική νόσο. Αυτά τα ευρήματα, υποδηλώνουν τον πιθανό ρόλο της κοκα-αιθυλένης στη νοσηρότητα και θνησιμότητα, που σχετίζονται με τη συνδυασμένη κατάχρηση κοκαΐνης και οινοπνεύματος.

      "abstract": "understand the effects of tenure, it is useful to consider the effects of alcohol: The first draught is usually medicinal. The elixir is a shield against unbearable pain. It is administered, perhaps, as an antidote to stress or to cope with trauma. But what begins as a means to succor from physical and psychological suffering imperceptibly but inevitably becomes an end in itself. Without recognizing it, one grows dependent on the drug. It gradually begins to distort one's sense of reality and leads to saying and doing things one would not have done in a nonaddicted state. Often, it leads to a kind of languor and to neglect of important tasks. The alcoholic's once bright potential slips away in a haze of paranoia, hostility, irresponsibility, and self -disrespect. But, significantly, the alcoholic will not, cannot, admit to the addiction. The alcoholic invents all sorts of reasons why he or she cannot live without drink. The alcoholic is consumed by fear of life without a support line. And try as he might to avoid it, there is an inescapable and terrible fact that the alcoholic must ultimately face: There is only one sure cure for alcoholism-abstinence . Like alcohol to alcoholics, tenure is too important to the American professoriat. Among a sample of humanities professors, tenure was ranked as the most significant factor to be considered when seeking a job, and a cross-section of the general professorial population ranked it a close second to money. Moreover, where tenure was once a means to the noble end of unfettered pursuit of knowledge, it has now become an end in itself.

      "abstract": "The hardening hypothesis proposes that as smoking prevalence declines, the proportion of ‘hard-core’ or ‘hardened’ smokers increases. The intuitively plausible logic is that less addicted and more motivated smokers are more likely to quit, leaving behind a growing proportion of ‘hardened’ smokers. If true, the hypothesis has implications for policy formulation and smoking cessation practice. For example, smokefree policies, health promotion campaigns and smoking cessation support services may need to be modified to ensure they reach and support quitting among the growing proportion of hardened smokers. Also, hardening would strengthen the justification for harm reduction strategies due to the need to provide less harmful alternatives to the increasing proportion of ‘hardened’ smokers who struggle to quit.\n\nThere are many ways in which hardening could manifest, creating multiple hypotheses which can be tested. For example, the population of smokers could become: (1) more highly addicted (eg, an increase in heavier or more dependent smokers); (2) less motivated to quit (eg, more smokers with no or low intention to quit, not making quit attempts or with lower self-efficacy about quitting); and (3) increasingly disadvantaged and marginalised (eg, more smokers who are disadvantaged or have mental health conditions). The net effect should be a reduced rate of quitting among the smoking population over time.\n\nSo what is the evidence for hardening? Most studies that have looked at the different aspects of hardening, either singly or in combination, are repeated surveys from the same population. Investigations from a variety of countries have generally found little or no …",

      "abstract": "Smoking and tobacco chewing are the predominant causes of oral cancer. Tobacco is the second-most widely consumed psychoactive substance. There are numerous ways to quit smoking, of which one is electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-cigarette use is a brand-new, global trend. E-cigarette is a battery-operated device that heats a liquid to create a vapor that the consumer inhales. Several countries have acknowledged that the first step toward electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) management is a precise classification of ENDS within the limits of current legislation. Countries have currently categorized ENDS into four generations. People's perceptions about tobacco products have altered recently as a consequence of the advertising of ENDS. The likelihood of starting to smoke cigarettes was four times higher in adolescents who used ENDS, and the probability of quitting was reduced and often prolonged in those who used ENDS. In addition, ENDS normalizes smoking-like actions including inhaling in and exhaling smoke. Adverse marketing via geographic locations and social media platforms, as well as nicotine's irreversible effects on growing adolescent and young adult brains that predispose individuals to addicted behaviors, may be responsible for their rising appeal among teenagers. Despite this, ENDS use has risen among young individuals who have never smoked and undoubtedly face more health risks than those who do not use ENDS. The oral cavity is the first to encounter ENDS in individuals and where it initially affects the human system. As a known contributor to cardiovascular diseases, neurological conditions, and cancers, nicotine seems to be a serious cause for concern. This review provides a concise summary of the research on the components, mode of action, applications, and effects of e-cigarettes on oral as well as systemic systems.",

      "abstract": "Four out of five members of a team of farmworkers who had been using various herbicides and pesticides in intensive agriculture became impotent. Sexual function recovered after further contact with the chemicals was stopped and hormone therapy had been given, though in one case this took about a year. We have not been able to incriminate one particular substance, but with the circumstantial evidence and the lack of any other obvious cause it seems likely that the impotence was due to the toxic effects of one or more of the chemicals being used.",

Una de las principales fuentes de estrés es la interacción social, que puede llevar a situaciones como el acoso escolar o laboral. En este artículo revisaremos la estrecha relación que existe entre la exposición a situaciones estresantes y el incremento en el consumo de la cocaína o el alcohol. Expondremos los principales resultados obtenidos con modelos animales ya que nos permiten estudiar los mecanismos cerebrales involucrados en el impacto del estrés sobre el consumo de drogas. Para concluir, detallaremos los principales mecanismos que explicarían el potente efecto que produce el estrés sobre el consumo de drogas.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world and is ingested in a variety of favorites, such as coffee, tea, cola and so on. Although it has been suggested that high dose caffeine users have more anxiety and depressive symptoms than low users, this relationship is not clear in Japan, where caffeine consumption is considered to be less than in Western countries. A questionnaire survey was conducted among medical students and 291 out of 423 initial subjects completed it. Among males, caffeine consumption was significantly and positively correlated with anxiety symptoms, when alcohol use and smoking habit were adjusted. However, there was no relationship between caffeine consumption and depressive symptoms. Among females, although there was no association between caffeine consumption and anxiety symptoms, high dose caffeine users showed less depressive symptoms than moderate and low users, when alcohol use was adjusted. It is suggested that caffeine use is one of the important factors, in researching psychological health among the general population. We need further epidemiological studies to determine whether there is a causal relationship between caffeine and psychological ill health or not.",

Patients who usually smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day also drank more alcohol and more tea or coffee than others. Heavy smoking and the frequent drinking of tea or coffee were associated with later times of going to bed at night but not with insomnia. Alcohol consumption was unrelated to any aspect of sleep habits. These findings are consistent with the view that heavy smokers tend to be more extroverted than non-smokers and seek arousal both by out-going social activities and by the use of stimulant drugs such as nicotine and caffeine. However, heavy smokers do not necessarily suffer from long-term emotional distress which would cause insomnia.",

We discuss the case of a patient who switched from traditional cigarettes to electronic cigarettes and thereupon had a significant increase in the clozapine serum level. The increased level led to considerable side-effects and, as a result, the patients clozapine dosage had to be reduced. In theory, a rise in the clozapine serum level is to be expected after such a switch. However, since electronic cigarettes have not been on the market for very long, psychiatrists need to be aware of the risks and dangers that can arise as a result of exceptionally high clozapine levels.",

The authors hypothesized that alcoholic subjects with panic attacks would abuse anxiolytic drugs more and panic-inducing drugs less frequently than nonanxious alcoholic subjects, and that their abuse of panic-inducing drugs would predate the age at panic onset. Findings indicate that alcoholic subjects with panic attacks (but not panic disorder) abused opiates and sedatives to a greater degree than nonanxious alcoholic subjects and abused marijuana, a panic-inducing drug, at a younger age. More alcoholic subjects with panic disorder than with panic attacks abused cocaine. The prevalence of abuse and the ages at onset of abuse of other drugs were similar for both the panic and the nonpanic group.",

O tabagismo constitui um problema de Saude Publica, que e capaz de gerar impacto. Compoem a fumaca produzida pelos cigarros cerca de 4.700 substâncias prejudiciais a saude. Os componentes misturados presentes nos cigarros incluem metais pesados, acidos e solventes orgânicos, entre outros, que produzem fumaca que quando inalada pode levar a problemas de saude. No cigarro existe a presenca da nicotina, alcatrao, do plutonio, monoxido de carbono, nitrosaminas, cadmio, arsenio, o cianeto de hidrogenio e os policiclicos. A dependencia quimica pelo consumo dos cigarros provem da nicotina, que e uma droga psicoativa. A nicotina constitui o principal empecilho da pratica do tabagismo, uma vez que a mesma provoca muitos problemas, incluindo alguns em âmbito odontologico, tais como: adesao aos dentes e capacidade de adentrar na cavidade bucal nos tecidos moles. O tabagismo pode promover manifestacoes sistemicas e bucais indesejaveis. A nivel odontologico pode ocorrer maior acumulo de biofilme dentario; câncer bucal; halitose; decrescimo na resposta imunologica e inflamatoria; imunossupressao; doencas periodontais; maior profundidade em bolsas periodontais; recessao gengival; perda de insercao periodontal; perdas dentarias; reabsorcao do rebordo alveolar; perda ossea alveolar aumentada; hipossalivacao; restauracoes dentarias e proteses dentarias pigmentadas e manchamento em lingua, dentes e na mucosa em decorrencia. O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar como o tabagismo pode afligir a saude oral dos usuarios. Realizou-se estudo de revisao bibliografica com levantamento nas bases de dados: PubMED, Google Academico envolvendo busca por estudos e artigos que versavam acerca das implicacoes odontologicas ocasionadas pelo tabagismo. O tabagismo deve ser abandonado e para promover auxilio e orientacoes aos tabagistas todo profissional de saude contactante, incluindo o cirurgiao dentista deve alertar esses pacientes sobre os possiveis maleficios sistemicos que podem ser ocasionados pela droga. O cirurgiao dentista pode enfatizar tambem danos que podem ser gerados a saude bucal. A cessacao do consumo dos cigarros auxilia na melhora da qualidade de vida e promove melhora no estado de saude sistemica e bucal apresentado.",

Drug use is a firm and accepted part of our culture; indeed, we are a drug-oriented society. People of all ages utilize a variety of prescription and non-prescription chemicals to alter symptoms, feelings, moods, or mind-states. Drug abuse applies to taking drugs in a manner that is organically or psychologically destructive, either because of the nature of the drug used or the quantity consumed. The term \"abuse\" unfortunately has been used pejoratively at times to criticize any drug use that is threatening, for real or imagined reasons, to the dominant society and its mores. Drug abuse is not a phenomenon restricted to contemporary youth; the significant point of distinction between the generations is that each has its \"own\" favourites. Alcohol, nicotine, tranquillizers, sedatives, stimulants, and pain relievers—traditional drugs—are as susceptible to use and to abuse as are the drugs more commonly favoured by the younger generation.",

Adverse effects of cinnamon are minimal; however, large doses over a long time period should be avoided. Cassia cinnamon may harm the liver in high doses and caution should be exercised in those with liver damage, concomitant use with drugs that affect the liver, and possibly blood-thinning medication. Patients should monitor their glucose levels, particularly if taking cinnamon with other medications or herbal supplements that may affect blood glucose.",

Diagnosis of voluntary caffeine overdose was made. The evolution was favorable after metabolic disorders correction, without the need for dialysis. Caffeine is a molecule free of serious adverse effects when consumed at low doses. However, when consumed at high doses, it can become toxic and lead to death. Caffeine consumption has increased in recent years and especially in French Army. This toxicity remains unknown by a large part of population. We must be vigilant because this substance misuse can lead to serious consequences.",

      "abstract": "Publisher Summary\r\nRounding off the “central eight” risk/need factors is substance abuse. Subsumed under substance abuse are alcohol misuse and the use of illegal drugs. Alcohol and other drug abuse are quite prevalent among offender populations, but their relationship to crime is moderate. The prevalence of alcohol abuse among offender samples is quite high, certainly much higher than that found in the general population. Offenders and victims also report a high incidence of drinking at the time of the offense. Treatments for alcohol abuse include a variety of interventions such as pharmacological treatment, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and alcoholics anonymous. This chapter discusses the community reinforcement approach to alcohol abuse. Unlike alcohol abuse, illegal drug abuse has a closer relationship to crime because of the illicit status of drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and so on. An addiction to any of these drugs places a person directly into contact with other criminals and, in many cases, may exert pressure to engage in other illegal activity in order to buy drugs. Some drugs directly initiate thoughts that lead to antisocial behavior. Substance abuse, undifferentiated from alcohol misuse, is a commonly found risk factor for crime among adults and young offenders. Treatment from a theoretical perspective includes offsetting the rewards associated with substance abuse involves altering many reinforcement contingencies.",

There is sufficient caffeine in a cup of coffee to have a stimulant effect. Caffeine can adversely affect some mental health symptoms, notably sleep and anxiety. Effects would be worse if consumed excessively. This survey aimed to describe the pattern of provision of caffeinated coffee to patients admitted to UK adult psychiatric intensive care units (PICUs) in order to inform local practice. All NHS adult PICUs across the UK were contacted to establish what type of coffee they routinely provided to their patients. Two thirds of PICUs provided only decaffeinated instant coffee to their patients. However, a minority provided caffeinated coffee in an unregulated manner, including three units which did not routinely offer decaffeinated coffee. National guidance to inform and direct the practice of providing or restricting the consumption of drinks containing psychoactive substances on a PICU may be beneficial.",

This dependence arises from the rituals and sensory associations of smoking that are reinforced, within seconds, by a rapid burst of nicotine from the cigarette. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) — gum, patches and inhaler — and bupropion are safe and effective for increasing smoking cessation rates in the short and long terms. Other than those who are minimally dependent, all patients willing to quit should be offered one of these therapies unless contraindications exist. The effectiveness of drug treatments is multiplied when associated with effective counseling or behavioral treatments. While NRT is not recommended during pregnancy or in patients with cardiac disease, if the alternative is smoking NRT is almost certainly safe. Combination NRT (more than one therapy) may be indicated in patients who have failed monotherapy in association with withdrawal symptoms. There are some specific contraindications to the use of bupropion. Its subsidized availability should not influence prescribers to ignore these.",

Por ejemplo, parece que se ha hecho mas potente en los ultimos anos el cannabis llamado sinsemilla de primera calidad, producido con frecuencia en interiores en los paises de consumo y que en algunas regiones va creciendo su cuota de mercado. Es posible que ello este conduciendo a una mayor localizacion de los mercados del producto. Tal vez explique tambien el aumento a nivel internacional del numero de consumidores sometidos a tratamiento. Sin embargo, la evaluacion del alcance de esta tendencia y sus efectos se ve obstaculizada por la falta de normas internacionales sobre cuestiones como la terminologia y por problemas sin resolver en el plano de la investigacion. A fin de estimar con exactitud el alcance mundial de la produccion se requieren mas datos cientificos sobre el rendimiento del cannabis. En el plano de la demanda se precisa mas informacion sobre las dosis y los volumenes de cannabis utilizados por los consumidores ocasionales y habituales. No se trata de una droga de tipo homogeneo: es preciso investigar las consecuencias de consumirla en diversos grados de potencia y distintas composiciones quimicas. Aunque los problemas relativos al cannabis se han evaluado ya muchas veces, sigue tratandose de una planta muy adaptable y, en consecuencia, de una droga dinamica, que exige reevaluacion permanente.",

Tobacco use has been linked to a wide variety of health consequences including numerous types of cancer, emphysema, and COPD. Despite the well-documented health consequences associated with using tobacco products, some individuals continue to smoke, while others believe that use of newer, more trendy products (e.g., e-cigarettes) are associated with little to no health risk. No matter what form of tobacco product an individual chooses to use, nicotine is highly addictive and is difficult to stop using. Considering that most people begin using tobacco before the age of 18, prevention efforts are important if we are to make further progress in combating this major health concern. Many different treatment modalities exist for those wishing to quit; however, most tobacco users relapse within the first 14 days of making a quit attempt. For this reason, it is important that we continue to improve our current knowledge base regarding tobacco cessation.",

The nicotine inhaler offers more habit replacement than any of the other forms of nicotine administration and is appropriate for smokers who are moderately addicted and need something to do with their hands. Use of nicotine replacement therapy is safe for most patients with cardiovascular disease, but should probably be restricted in pregnancy to heavy smokers who are unable to quit. Bupropion, a modest dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, increases quit rates compared with placebo. Future therapies will include combinations of nicotine replacement products, and combinations of nicotine products with other medications.

Notably, the majority of nicotine-containing e-cigarette users report wanting to quit in the near future, yet there is a dearth of research surrounding intervention efforts. Cannabidiol (CBD) has potential to facilitate e-cigarette quit attempts by decreasing withdrawal symptom intensity and anxiety during nicotine e-cigarette abstinence.",

      "title": "Patient Perspectives: Barriers to Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapies Create Problems for Patients and Survivors",
      "abstract": "There are multiple barriers to better understanding of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches and the use of natural substances to reduce cancer risk. CAM approaches are not patentable, and the pharmaceutical industry has no interest in the area. Research generally approaches concepts from the deconstructionist side: there may be interest in herbal mixtures but its \"active\" constituents are explored one at a time, missing any synergistic or even additive effects. Little attention has been paid to environmental pollutants and exposures. Most patients believe these are active causes of their disease, but researchers are still exposing animals to one chemical one time, which fails to duplicate human exposures. Attention to lifestyle issues is presented almost solely in terms of obesity--a concept that is a barrier to change by itself. Research animals rarely if ever are fed dietary components that humans normally eat, such as soda or diet soda, potato chips, and high-fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, artificial flavors, other additives, or combinations of bad fats with too much sugar, too much salt, and artificial ingredients. Long-term treatment effects on survivors may not necessarily require a solely pharmaceutical approach. Drugs to treat each condition separately may require even more drugs to offset the unwanted effects of each. Whole systems approaches to research are urgently needed. A final barrier is that once a treatment is accepted in mainstream, it ceases to be considered \"alternative.\" The genesis is soon forgotten and the remaining alternative modalities continue to be viewed with suspicion, doubt, and misunderstanding, to the detriment of both patients in treatment and cancer survivors.",

Caffeine is pervasive in our beverages, foods, and medicines. Americans may find it difficult, even impossible, to completely eliminate from their diets. Caffeine is a natural ingredient in coffees, chocolates, and teas. It is intentionally added to products ranging from sodas, sports drinks, performance dietary supplements, alcoholic beverages, headache medicines, and even drinking water. Routine, extensive ingestion of America's favorite drug reflects our societal acquiescence in addiction. A caffeine high is an innocent pleasure that millions undertake one or more times each day to stimulate their minds and bodies to perform at peak levels. Caffeine provides a daily, inexpensive boost of energy that makes life better for many Americans, regardless of their social class, ethnicity, or status.",

They contain high levels of caffeine and other additives that act as stimulants. Several recent studies present that energy drinks could increase the risk of seizures, acid-base disorders and cardiovascular events. The authors report a 28-year-old man who was brought to the emergency room after sudden onset of tonic-clonic seizures and metabolic acidosis after drinking several cans of a caffeinated energy drink. The authors believe that this clinical picture was caused by caffeine intoxication from an energetic drink causing a syndrome of catecholamine excess. The patient was discharged within a week with no complaints and no neurological signs. Finally, recognising the features of caffeine intoxication and its potential health consequences may be especially relevant when treating younger persons who may be more likely to consume energy drinks.",

However, since the number of people who use cannabis worldwide is so high, those who will eventually develop psychosis, whilst still a minority, represent a large number. The evidence indicates that different patterns of cannabis use have a different impact on the risk of developing psychosis, with young age at first use, and a higher frequency of use of high-potency types of cannabis indicated as the most important risk factors. Nonetheless, given the complex nature of the association between cannabis use and psychosis, it is hard to determine which cannabis users will eventually develop psychosis. The link between cannabis use and schizophrenia is unlikely to be just the result of a genetic predisposition, it is more likely the result of Gene x Environment inter-play.",

      "title": "The Nontherapeutic Use of Psychotherapeutic Drugs among the College Age Group: The Sedatives and Tranquilizers",
      "abstract": "Abstract The sedatives and minor tranquilizers comprise two large groups of prescription drugs widely used without medical supervision by the college age group. Within the sedative group, the barbiturates and methaqualone are currently the most popular. An estimated nine million Americans have used sedatives without medical supervision, approximately five and one-half million of whom are within the college age group. The appeal of barbiturates to college students is that these drugs produce a “high” similar to that of alcohol, relieve feelings of stress, and produce a temporary sense of well-being. Tolerance and dependence develop quickly; high doses impair motor coordination and judgment. Barbiturates are frequently implicated in auto accidents and in suicides. Methaqualone continues to be popular among students because of its purported aphrodisiac effects and because it is frequently used to bring the cocaine user “down.” Its increase in use has therefore paralleled the increase in use of cocaine. The use of tranquilizers has doubled between 1972 and 1982. Valium, the most popular of tranquilizers, continues to be widely used among students because of its ability to be absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream and to produce its effects of euphoria and acute intoxication quickly. Though Valium is considered to be a relatively safe drug, it can be fatal if taken in large doses with alcohol. Tolerance and both psychological dependence and physiological addiction may occur and cause students to use increasing doses of the drug. A detailed knowledge of the adverse psychological and biological effects of the sedatives and tranquilizers will prove helpful to all those working within the college health facilities.",

Most smokers want to quit but find it difficult. Behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapies are available, safe, and effective in the treatment of tobacco dependence. Nicotine replacement therapy effectively delivers nicotine in safer doses without exposure to the toxins and chemicals in cigarette smoke. The optimal duration of tobacco dependence treatment is unknown, and some smokers may require extended courses. For smokers using long-term cessation medications, health care providers should encourage treatment and insurance carriers should cover it. Both tobacco dependence and such conditions as diabetes are similar in their potential to exacerbate other diseases, their behavioral components of treatment, and their effectiveness of medications. Despite these similarities, treatments for diabetes are well covered by insurance, whereas tobacco dependence treatments are often limited. Tobacco dependence should share the status of other chronic illnesses, with effective treatments given as long as is necessary to achieve successful clinical outcomes.",

It is a psychoactive substance that affects the brain and central nervous system. When nicotine is consumed through smoking, vaping, or other methods, it quickly reaches the brain, leading to a release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, which causes feelings of pleasure and relaxation. However, nicotine is highly addictive, and its use can lead to physical and psychological dependence. Due to its addictive nature, nicotine is often the primary reason people find it challenging to quit smoking or using tobacco products. It's essential to be aware of the potential health risks associated with nicotine use, particularly through smoking, which is linked to various diseases like lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. While some people use nicotine replacement therapies (like patches, gum, or lozenges) to help quit smoking, it's essential to seek professional advice and support when trying to break the addiction.",

      "title": "Gebruik en aanschaf van cannabis door 16- en 17-jarigen",
      "abstract": "Naar aanleiding van een toezegging van de Minister van Justitie tijdens het Nationaal Jeugddebat 2001 is door het WODC een beknopt literatuuronderzoek uitgevoerd naar het gebruik en de aanschaf van cannabis door 16- en 17-jarigen. Hieronder de belangrijkste bevindingen. Cannabis is bij 16- en 17-jarige jongeren verreweg de meest gebruikte drug. Gebruik van harddrugs komt veel minder voor. Een minderheid van de jongeren heeft naast cannabis ooit andere drugs genomen. Het cannabisgebruik onder jongeren, ook onder 16- en 17-jarigen, is de laatste jaren gestabiliseerd. Hetzelfde geldt voor andere drugs. De 16- en 17-jarigen kopen hun cannabis vooral in de coffeeshop of krijgen het via hun sociale netwerk. Sinds 1996 is de rol van de coffeeshop bij de aanschaf van cannabis in deze leeftijdsgroep duidelijk kleiner geworden. De rol van het sociale netwerk bij de aanschaf van cannabis is ondertussen toegenomen. Toch lijkt zich geen belangrijke verschuiving voorgedaan te hebben in de lokale cannabismarkten. Dit zou komen doordat het sociale netwerk de cannabis voor de 16- en 17-jarige gebruikers vaak bij de coffeeshop haalt en een deel van de jongeren daar nog steeds zelf koopt. Op grond van de beschikbare informatie kan niet met zekerheid gezegd worden of 16- en 17-jarigen door de aanschaf van cannabis via het sociale netwerk meer in aanraking komen met harddrugs en criminele of gevaarlijke situaties. Ook is niet bekend hoe jongeren het ervaren om meer via het sociale netwerk en minder bij de coffeeshop te kopen. Tenslotte staat niet vast of er enig verband bestaat tussen een toegenomen hulpvraag bij de verslavingszorg en de verhoging van de minimumleeftijd. Om over deze kwesties duidelijkheid te krijgen zou nader onderzoek nodig zijn. Al met al wekt de beschikbare informatie echter de indruk dat de verhoging van de leeftijdsgrens voor de toegang tot coffeeshops tot nu toe geen nadelige neveneffecten voor de 16- en 17-jarigen heeft gehad: noch de gebruikscijfers, noch de gegevens over het aankoopgedrag laten zorgwekkende trends zien.",

Vietnam veterans were more likely to have begun using heroin during their military service, and they were more likely to say that their service experiences had affected their use of drugs, usually citing relief of fear and tensions of war. Veterans who had not been in Vietnam were somewhat more likely to have begun using drugs after service, and generally indicated that their military experiences had not affected their drug use. When they did cite an effect of service, the factors usually indicated were boredom and a lack of meaningful activity. Attitudes toward narcotic use were negative in both groups, but significantly less so among Vietnam veterans. However, these attitudes did not relate to patterns of current or past drug use. Groups did not differ in the extent of or reasons for current illicit drug use, but non-Vietnam veterans reported more alcohol use. The Vietnam war was mentioned by one Vietnam veteran and by no non-Vietnam veterans as a reason for continuing narcotic use. Few other differences were found. Notably, typical treatment course over a 5-year follow-up period was similar in the two study groups.",

      "title": "Caffeine, mood and mental performance in everyday life",
      "abstract": "Summary Caffeine is the most popular drug in the world. After consumption, it is rapidly distributed throughout the body where it acts by blocking the action of endogenous adenosine at adenosine A 1 and A 2a receptors, resulting in a variety of physiological effects. Although it is valued as a useful psychostimulant, recent evidence suggests that actually little or no acute benefit is gained from regular caffeine consumption. This is because withdrawal of caffeine ( e.g. overnight) lowers alertness and mood and degrades performance, and while consumption of some more caffeine reverses these effects, it does not boost functioning to above ‘normal’ levels. It also tends to increase anxiety, particularly in susceptible individuals. In contrast, caffeine consumption may separately lower the risk of cognitive decline in older age, perhaps owing to effects involving neuroprotective functions of the adenosine system. Currently, however, not enough is known to do a full risk assessment on these or other potential health effects of dietary caffeine.",

Some societies have regarded cannabis as a sacred boon for mankind that offers respite from the tribulations of everyday life, whereas others have demonized it as inevitably leading to \"reefer madness.\" Millions of young people on both sides of the Atlantic are more or less regular users of cannabis, but official attitudes vary widely. In Europe, several countries have relaxed the legal penalties associated with its use. In the United States, several states have sanctioned the medical use of cannabis, and some states have even approved its recreational use; however, these states remain in conflict with the federal government, which continues to view cannabis as an illegal and harmful drug. Cannabis accounted for 643,00 arrests in 2016 in the United States, which were often followed by draconian penalties.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: En nuestro país las bebidas alcohólicas causan una elevada morbimortalidad en ambos sexos además de múltiples problemas sociales y legales. En la adolescencia se inician conductas que ponen en severo riesgo la salud .Casi dos tercios de las muertes prematuras y un tercio de la morbilidad en adultos se asocian a condiciones o comportamientos que comenzaron en su juventud. La ingesta copiosa de alcohol en forma reiterada puede ocasionar daños irreversibles tanto a nivel cerebral, como en otros órganos. Si a esta conducta, se asocia el consumo de bebidas energizantes, se altera el patrón de uso de bebidas alcohólicas, especialmente destiladas, ya que la mezcla mejora el sabor y potencia el consumo. A lo que se debe sumar los efectos propios de las bebidas energizantes.Objetivos:Investigar el consumo de alcohol asociado a bebidas “energizantes” en la llamada “previa”, y la permisibilidad de los padresMaterial y método: Se investigó el consumo de alcohol asociado a bebidas energizantes, en 370 personas de diferentes niveles educativos , entre 18 a 35 años, que en forma voluntaria y anónima completaron una encuesta estructurada y cerrada,en formato Google Drive la cual indagaba sobre “la previa”.Resultados:El 89% de los encuestados que respondieron la encuesta, estaban entre los 18 y 24 años; 65,4 % del sexo femenino. El 71 % manifestaron ser estudiantes universitarios, de los cuales 51% vive con su familia nuclear, del total de los encuestados 91 % consume bebidas alcohólicas, el 70% ingiere más de 2-3 medidas de alcohol y el 41 % bebió en la última semana (alcohol o mezcla). El 40% bebe alcohol con bebidas energizantes, 68% comienza a beber en su domicilio con el consentimiento de sus padres ,de éstos, 36% relata haber presentado síntomas compatibles con intoxicación, el 25% de éstas intoxicaciones ocurrieron en el domicilio en el cual viven con sus padres.Conclusión:El consumo de alcohol en jóvenes en “La previa” es problemático,tornándose más severo al asociarlo a bebidas energizantes. Cifras que coinciden con otros estudios de nuestro medio. Llama la atención la tolerancia social de los adultos. Sin duda, deben realizarse más estudios al respecto.",

Even most people addicted to the weed are willing to admit that it is bad for your health, but that they have decided to smoke it anyway for a surprisingly wide variety of reasons. Needless to say, nonsmokers do not usually find any of these reasons compelling, or even rational, given the evidence that inexorably links smoking to multiple causes of morbidity and premature mortality. Were it not for the truly enormous public health costs, and the intrusive nature of smoke on other people’s airspace, non-smokers would probably merely pity their deluded smoking brethren. Even allowing for the addictive properties of tobacco, non-smokers tend to think that the only plausible explanation for smoking is that smokers simply do not believe that any of the adverse consequences are going to happen to them: a position of faith, which is often rapidly abandoned (albeit too late in many cases) when the worst happens.

Anticipations of stimulant and sedative effects have not been investigated extensively. The present study examined the stimulant and sedative effects subjects anticipated experiencing if they were on the ascending or descending limb of the blood alcohol curve after consuming two or four standard drinks. One hundred sixty-six undergraduates reported anticipating greater stimulant effects than sedative effects on the ascending limb of the blood alcohol curve, and greater sedative effects than stimulant effects on the descending limb. Subjects also reported anticipating larger effects with larger doses. Men tended to anticipate smaller effects than women. These results support the notion that specific anticipated effects vary with dosage and the limb of blood alcohol curve, suggesting that the study of anticipated effects of alcohol should employ these variables.",

Nicotine dependence is a serious public health problem because it causes continued tobacco use, which is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide, causing more than 8 million deaths per year. The result of the journal review is that preventing the use of tobacco products among adolescents is critical to ending nicotine addiction worldwide. The impact caused by nicotine tends to be bad, so stopping is the way out.

      "abstract": "Caffeine is a substance that is found naturally in many plants and is often found in many of the drinks and foods we consume. The widespread use of caffeine is continually on the rise as we can easily find caffeine in coffee, tea, soda, chocolate, energy drinks and gels, gum, and pharmaceutical drugs. Caffeine is recognized as the World’s most commonly used drug and is frequently used by athletes as a nutritional ergogenic aid during training and competition. Caffeine is often administered as a liquid or in a capsule, but new research has shown that caffeine gum has a faster absorption rate and a higher relative bioavailability. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of different dosages caffeine gum ingestion on blood lactate and glucose during 1500-m running. Fifteen well-trained male runners completed a doubleblind, placebo controlled experiment. The runners [mean±SD] weight, height, age, and percentage body fat were 64.7±4.91 kg, 174.5±2.73 cm, 21.7±4.76 years, and 13.7±5.08 %, respectively. Chewing gum [3,4,5 mg.kg-1 of caffeine] or a placebo was administered at three time points [Thirty-five minutes pre-exercise, 5 minutes pre-exercise, and immediately following exercise]. The participants were instructed to chew for five minutes. Participants raced 1500-m distance. Blood glucose and lactate were measured via a finger prick in any four stages, 5 minutes pre-1500-m running, and immediately following 1500-m running. The rest Interval between any measurement stages was one week. The results indicated no significantly different between that blood glucose [p<0.05] and blood lactate [p<0.05] levels over time with the different dosages caffeine and versus the placebo. This was one of the first exercise studies conducted that administered caffeine gum and should be used as a starting point for future research on caffeine gum and exercise.",

Dhoomanetra is a special instrument used to perform Dhumapana. This is designed in such a way that makes sure the smoke is inhaled properly. There are specific instructions to be followed based on the type of herbs and substances used for Dhumapana. However, it's crucial to be aware of the Dhumapana contraindications, such as being too young or old or suffering from specific Pitta-related health issues. Dhumapana can have negative effects if performed improperly or excessively, although these effects can be controlled using ayurvedic treatments.

      "title": "Strategies to Help Patients Break the Chains of Tobacco Addiction: Evidence-Based Treatments Can Help Patients Quit despite Psychiatric Illness",
      "abstract": "You are treating Mr. P, age 34, for schizoaffective disorder. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and has smoked for approximately 17 years. He has tried to stop but never has been able to quit for more than a few weeks. He reveals whenever he tries to quit, he starts feeling extremely lethargic and and resumes smoking to prevent these symptoms from worsening. However, Mr. P expresses some interest in trying to quit again and asks whether any medications could prevent him from becoming depressed while he tries to quit Cigarette smoking is overrepresented and undertreated among individuals with psychiatric illness, in part because of the largely unfounded belief held by some patients and clinicians that smoking cessation might worsen psychiatric symptoms. In this article, we argue this challenge can be overcome and psychiatrists and other mental health professionals can and should help their patients reap the innumerable benefits of quitting smoking. We discuss: * the short-and long-term effects of smoking cessation * evidence-based treatment guidelines for working with motivated and unmotivated smokers * unique issues that may arise when treating smokers who have psychiatric disorders. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Quitting: Profound benefits Quitting smoking has substantial benefits beginning within minutes after taking the last puff. Some of the benefits that occur within the first few days of quitting include: * decreased blood pressure and pulse rate * improved circulation * improved ability to smell and taste * easier breathing. Longer-term smoking abstinence drastically reduces risk of heart attack, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease, and a host of other illnesses that affect--and kill--individuals with psychiatric disorders several decades earlier than their counterparts in the general population. (1) There also are financial benefits to quitting; using the 2009 national average of $5.33 per pack, a 1-pack-per-day smoker who quits would save > $150 per month, which accounts for only the direct cost of cigarettes. (2) Although the beneficial effects of quitting smoking are profound and far-reaching, in the short-term they are counterbalanced by nicotine withdrawal symptoms--including restlessness, irritability, depressed mood, concentration problems, and increased appetite/weight gain--that are formidable distractions from the positive aspects of quitting. Additionally nicotine withdrawal symptoms tend to be more severe in smokers who have a psychiatric disorder. (3) Fortunately, there are effective, evidence-based methods of reducing withdrawal symptoms and helping smokers cope with these and other challenges of quitting. Combined treatment is best Current treatment guidelines (4) suggest all smokers should be offered pharmacotherapy and counseling to aid quitting because this combined approach has the highest success rate (Algorithm). Table 1 (page 44) (4) provides information about dosing, efficacy, and side effect profile of each of the 7 FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation. Using any of the approved medications at least doubles the odds of successful quitting compared with placebo. (4) These pharmacotherapies can reduce or prevent nicotine withdrawal symptoms and--at least in the case of bupropion and varenicline--decrease reinforcement from smoking, thereby lowering the likelihood a lapse (ie, smoking [greater than or equal to] 1 cigarettes without returning to regular smoking) will develop into a full-blown relapse (ie, return to regular smoking).

      "title": "Reducing polypharmacy in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Why is it so hard to stop medications? Pharmacists see it all the time—elderly patients taking 15, 20, sometimes 25 medications. Pill burden can be as high as 60 doses per day. Patients are unsure of the reasons for medications, take them haphazardly and often have other medications added to treat side effects. They tell us they hate taking these drugs. Family doctors express frustration, sometimes inheriting an elderly patient with little medication history and struggling to keep up with changes made during multiple hospital admissions or specialist visits. They feel pressured by various clinical guidelines to start medications, aren’t sure what a patient is actually taking, may have difficulty distinguishing symptoms from side effects, but don’t have a ready-made solution to the problem.1\r\n\r\nPolypharmacy is variously defined as high numbers of medications (e.g., more than 5-10), use of more drugs than clinically indicated or use of inappropriate medications. In 2009, 63% of Canadian seniors were taking more than 5 medications, and 30% of those older than 85 years were taking more than 10. The prevalence is even higher for those living in long-term care.2\r\n\r\nThe impact of polypharmacy on our elderly population is significant. It is associated with poor adherence, drug-drug interactions, medication errors and adverse drug reactions—including falls, hip fractures, confusion and delirium—accounting for a significant percentage of potentially preventable emergency room visits and hospitalization.3,4\r\n\r\nBut interventions to reduce medication use are not consistently used. There are consensus-developed screening criteria for inappropriate medications, as well as algorithms and acronyms to help health care professionals conduct medication reviews to identify drug-related problems.5 However, there is little guidance with regard to how to implement suggested changes to reduce medication use. Many prescribers are reluctant to make such changes, often fearing adverse drug withdrawal events,6 and say they do not want to “rock the boat.”\r\n\r\nIn the Geriatric Day Hospital of Bruyere Continuing Care, our elderly patients often have multiple issues such as cognitive impairment, falls, pain and deconditioning. They attend twice weekly for functional assessment and rehabilitation with an interprofessional team. Patients referred for medication review are typically taking 15 medications per day and have an average of 9 drug-related problems.7 We see prescribing cascades (in which a medication has been started to treat a side effect of another medication) and adverse effects of drugs on multiple systems, including hypotension, impaired cognition and balance problems. One by one, over a 10- to 12-week admission, we taper and stop those medications for which we have little evidence for continued use and those that might be contributing to adverse effects. We focus on reducing pill burden, facilitating independent medication management, furthering knowledge and understanding of medication use and communicating changes clearly. The outcome can be amazing. We’ve seen patients demonstrate significant improvement in symptoms with reduction in medication.\r\n\r\nFrustrated with the never-ending supply of patients suffering with polypharmacy, and the lack of broadly implemented clinical guidance to reduce polypharmacy, we have developed a series of case reports about polypharmacy in the elderly that demonstrate the strategies we employ to reduce medication use in our patients. Identifying drug-related problems, prioritizing them, using tapering approaches, monitoring for adverse drug-withdrawal events, reducing pill burden and appropriately using compliance strategies are demonstrated throughout these cases. As an interprofessional team, each member plays a role in helping to reduce medication use and monitor the effects. We have therefore designed the case reports so they can be used for interprofessional education in geriatric pharmacotherapy. The series is planned for the Canadian Pharmacists Journal, Canadian Family Physician and the Canadian Medical Association Journal. Each case will link to online resources to facilitate interprofessional discussion.\r\n\r\nWe hope pharmacists and other health care professionals will find the strategies in this series supportive of their own efforts to reduce polypharmacy. With recent regulatory and remuneration changes, pharmacists are even better placed to actively participate in optimizing therapy in the elderly.8 We hope those who develop clinical guidelines will take note and consider how they might include “deprescribing” guidelines to further support tapering and stopping of medications when evidence is limited or when pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters affecting medication distribution and effectiveness change with age.8\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank the Bruyere Academic Medical Organization for its support, our colleagues in the Geriatric Day Hospital of Bruyere Continuing Care for their collaboration and our patients who willingly work with us to taper their medications, particularly the many patients who enthusiastically agreed to share their stories. We hope you enjoy the series and welcome your comments and feedback. ■",

      "title": "Smoking Cessation Leads to Reduced Stress, but Why?",
      "abstract": "Recent longitudinal studies have demonstrated that smoking cessation leads to reduced feelings of stress. This finding is not predicted by either of the two main models for smoking behavior. The nicotine resource model (Warburton) states that nicotine is used to cope with external stressors, and predicts that smokers will suffer from increased stress when they quit smoking. The deprivation reversal model (Schachter), suggests that smoking reverses the deleterious effects of deprivation; cessation will then lead to a period of increased stress, followed by a return to baseline. Although the stress/cessation data agree with neither model, they are consistent with a third explanation, namely that smoking causes stress. This model states that acute nicotine deprivation (i.e., between cigarettes) leads to increased stress. Smokers then use cigarettes to reverse these withdrawal effects and \"normalize\" their mood. This model explains some paradoxical aspects of the smoking/mood relationship. First, why smokers are calmed by smoking, yet report high average levels of stress. Second, why stress levels become reduced after smoking cessation; this is because the former smoker no longer suffers from the adverse mood effects of acute nicotine depletion.",

      "abstract": "Hypnotics are taken by a fifth of adults at home, and by half those in hospital for more than 17 days. Such prescription may be inappropriate in the elderly since their insomnia frequently results from conditions such as depression, boredom and loneliness. Furthermore the elderly are more susceptible to adverse drug reactions due to decreased efficiency in eliminating drugs from the body and increased target organ response. They are also less able to compensate for unwanted effects, which may last up to 36 hours after a single dose. Despite this, there appears little attempt to reduce dosage in old patients or to select hypnotics less likely to produce side effects. We would suggest that these drugs should be prescribed with caution in the elderly, and only after a full history and examination of the patient. The drug, dosage and length of treatment should then be selected individually.",

      "abstract": "Polydrug use is presented as a particular drug-use phenomenon when the combination of substances is and always has been the practice. The origin of the term is found in the early years of the war on drugs under the Nixon administration in the US, when it was used to justify the intensification of repressive measures against drug users and to counter the growing accommodation and normalisation of cannabis. Only by presenting cannabis as the first step towards the use of harder drugs could the repression of this largely innocuous and widely used substance be justified. Drug users were presented as \"polydrug users\", which offered an explanation of problematic use as rooted in the drug user, the addict, who would switch substances in accordance with availability and price. Having become established for political reasons, the term has become entrenched because it resonates and vividly describes social practice. Yet it does not add to understanding of social reality but occludes and confuses because it presents \"polydrug\" as a particular and peculiar pattern of consumption and not as the norm.",

Among its components can be found: caffeine, guarana, taurine, ging-Seng, L-carnitine, creatinine or glucuronolactone, citric acid and phosphoric acid, among others. A responsible and occasional consumption should not pose major problems, but this is not the case. The medical effects are usually caused by their abuse, like: headaches, palpitations, insomnia, sweating, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, gastroesophageal reflux, facial numbness, bloating, tremor, diarrhea and even addiction, among others. While in the dental level, specifically on the dental enamel, the most severe impact is the erosion and the lesser impact is tooth staining, which has not yet been fully investigated, also have been described the development of hypersensitivity. A timely prevention and diagnosis are essential to minimize the damage caused by prolonged use of these products. It is essential to avoid a possible trend or “fad” associated with mixing energy drinks and alcohol and even drugs, of which they are not fully known the possible risks that could potentially cause. Due to its exponential growth it is essential to have an updated knowledge about the consumption of these beverages. The high consumption of energy drinks maintained over time is associated with negative effects at the medical and dental level. Further research is necessary to prevent, treat and rehabilitate the consequences produced by the consumption of these products.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco cessation represents a multifaceted approach involving patients who often don't neatly fit into classic prototypes.Researchers found that current smokers experience a more than 10-year reduction in life expectancy compared to non-smokers, and more than half make an attempt each year, but less than 10% manage to stay smoke-free for at least 6 months.Therefore, it's recommended to employ a combination of methods and strategies, ranging from questionnaires to established medications.The role of the medical staff is and remains vital in this context.Nicotine is a potent drug due to its rapid absorption and swift diffusion into the central nervous system, and quitting nicotine leads to important consequences, such as craving, drug-seeking behaviour and withdrawal symptoms.Negative affective states also emerge, characterized by symptoms like depressed mood, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.Hierarchical multiple regression models have revealed that extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness and age are among the predictors of daily cigarette consumption.The authors discuss both traditional and innovative opportunities to expedite this process, while analysing the potential to enhance the compliance of healthcare providers and patients.Smoking cessation, the process of quitting smoking, can be approached through both pharmacological (medication-based) and non-pharmacological (behavioural and supportive) methods.The choice of approach or combination of approaches depends on individual preferences and needs. RezumatRenunțarea la fumat reprezintă o abordare complexă a unui pacient care adesea nu se încadrează în prototipurile clasice.Cercetările au evidențiat că fumătorii se confruntă cu o reducere de peste 10 ani a speranței de viață în comparație cu nefumătorii și mai mult de jumătate fac o încercare de a renunța în fiecare an, dar mai puțin de 10% reușesc să rămână abstinenți cel puțin 6 luni.Prin urmare, se recomandă utilizarea unei combinații de metode și strategii, de la chestionare la medicamente deja stabilite, iar rolul personalului medical este și rămâne vital în acest context.Nicotina este un drog puternic datorită absorbției și difuzării rapide în sistemul nervos central, iar renunțarea conduce la efecte secundare importante, precum dorința arzătoare, comportamentul de căutare a drogului și simptomele de sevraj.Apar și stări afective negative, caracterizate prin simptome precum depresie, anxietate, iritabilitate și insomnie.Modelele ierarhice de regresie multiplă au dezvăluit că extraversia, nevroticismul, conștiinciozitatea și vârsta se numără printre predictorii consumului zilnic de țigări.Autorii discută oportunități vechi și noi de a accelera acest proces analizând posibilitatea de a îmbunătăți complianța furnizorilor de servicii medicale și a pacienților.Procesul de renunțare la fumat, poate fi abordat atât prin metode farmacologice, cât și prin metode comportamentale și de susținere.Alegerea abordării sau combinația de abordări depinde de preferințele și nevoile individuale.",

      "abstract": "Alors que plusieurs États américains ont fait le choix d’assouplir la législation entourant l’usage récréatif du cannabis et qu’au Canada, cette substance est encadrée par un programme fédéral pour son utilisation thérapeutique, le débat sur l’utilisation du cannabis et ses effets néfastes continue de faire couler beaucoup d’encre. S’éloignant souvent des données probantes, ce débat est généralement marqué par des positions clivées qui ne rendent pas compte des nuances récemment apportées par les données scientifiques sur le sujet. Afin de pouvoir bien évaluer les risques que pose cette substance, nous suggérons ici de délaisser le questionnement dichotomique quant au fait que le cannabis cause, ou pas, certains problèmes de santé au profit d’une discussion sur les facteurs modulant la relation entre le cannabis et certains effets délétères potentiels, notamment sur le plan de la cognition, de la psychose et de la toxicomanie. Nous discutons ainsi de certaines données sur la composition du cannabis, son mode d’utilisation, le type de population en faisant usage et la présence de stresseurs environnementaux, qui semblent tous moduler les risques associés à la consommation de cannabis. Devant les données indiquant que le cannabis est une substance psychoactive possédant à la fois des effets délétères et bénéfiques, et au regard du fait qu’une minorité d’individus éprouveront des difficultés après en avoir consommé, il nous semble crucial de faire bon usage et d’approfondir la littérature scientifique portant sur ces facteurs modulateurs. Nous pensons que cela pourrait permettre de mieux informer la population et prendre des décisions plus éclairées, notamment quant aux modalités entourant un éventuel changement au statut légal du cannabis.",

      "abstract": "Ask any college student how he or she gets through long study sessions, all-nighters, and the always grueling finals week and he or she will most likely reference some caffeine-containing beverage as the antidote, with energy drinks becoming an ever increasing option. The effects, both physiological and psychological, of the ingredients in energy drinks (caffeine and, to a lesser degree, glucose) dictate their usefulness to consumers. A review of the available research literature from http://scholar.google.com using the following keywords: “caffeine,” “energy drink,” “Red Bull,” “caffeinated beverage,” “caffeine drink,” “energy drink industry,” “energy drink company,” and “glucose” yielded the references that have been aggregated, synthesized, and summarized in this thesis. Caffeine’s ability to improve one’s subjective mood, reaction time, memory, and attention has been scientifically verified by the available research literature; in essence, then, caffeine is a legal, low-grade stimulant. The ubiquity of caffeine in everyday life has made its consumption a part of everyday life and a normal means of self-medication. This ubiquity in today’s society has also been promoted by the lax regulatory structure regarding the compound – a regulatory structure that has allowed EDs manufacturers to include five times more caffeine in their products than in a can of Coca-Cola. EDs manufacturers have embraced caffeine’s stimulatory effects in such an atmosphere of lax regulation and high demand produced by environmental and societal factors to produce high-caffeine, high-sugar products uniquely suited to their target demographic – twenty year olds. However, they also dictate the negative side effects that can harm consumer health over the short or long-term.",

Dabei werden die psychotropen Effekte trotz prinzipieller Vergleichbarkeit unterschiedlich geordnet. Im islamischen Mittelalter verstand sich Cannabiskonsum im Zusammenhang mit religiös-mystischem Erleben und wurde entscheidend durch den Konsum der Sufis geprägt. Gefahren zeigten sich vor allem in der Induktion des „Wahnsinns” bei übermäßigem Konsum, eine gesellschaftliche Ächtung der Cannabinoide gab es hingegen nicht. In den heutigen, westlich-zivilisierten Ländern zeigt Cannabiskonsum einen Zusammenhang mit dem Erleben entspannter Aktivität und ist vor allem mit Jugendlichkeit verbunden. Gefahren zeigen sich vorwiegend in der Sorge um eine weitergehende „Drogenkarriere”, wohingegen die mögliche Induktion einer schizophreniformen Psychose gesellschaftlich weniger Beachtung findet. Selbstaussagen von Cannabiskonsumenten verwiesen zu allen Zeiten auf einen kreativen Aspekt des Cannabiskonsums, der in der bewussten Gestaltung und Übersetzung des im Rausch Erlebten bestand. Dabei scheint die Ungewöhnlichkeit der Erfahrung und deren Einbringen in die sonstige Realität entscheidend. Dieser Aspekt hat hingegen in der derzeitigen Forschung wenig Beachtung gefunden.

      "title": "Drinking under special occasion permits: a neglected aspect of alcohol control measures?",
      "abstract": "Drinking that occurs under special permits in Canada, such as at weddings, private receptions and parties, is a neglected aspect of alcohol research. These permits are issued for many different occasions and are most common in the provinces with the highest per capita alcohol consumption. Special permit drinking is becoming a social and alcohol-control issue but information on the problems it creates is sparse. Specific problem areas such as excessive drinking and drinking by minors have not been studied, but because such drinking is rarely monitored they may be substantial. Further study of special permit drinking is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Food-drug interactions are defined as alterations of pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of a drug or nutritional element or a compromise in nutritional status as a result of the addition of a drug. Elderly patients are particularly at risk because more than 30% of all the prescription drugs are taken by this population. Failure to identify and properly manage drug-nutrient interactions can lead to serious consequences. For instance, drug-nutrient interactions can result in reduced absorption of certain oral antibiotics and may lead to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection. This predisposes the patient to treatment failure. Induction or inhibition of enzymes in the gut by nutrients may lead to a significant change in oral bioavailability of drugs or vice versa. For example, grapefruit juice is a selective intestinal CYP3A4 inhibitor. The overall exposure of some drugs can be increased by more than fivefold when taken with grapefruit juice and increase the risk of adverse effects. The use of certain drugs may affect GI tract function and may lead to a loss of bodily electrolytes and fluid. Limiting drug prescriptions to essential medications for as short a period as possible and periodic re-evaluations of the treatment chosen are essential to minimize adverse drug-nutrient interactions.",

      "abstract": "Antecedentes. Objetivo. Describir los componentes de las bebidas energizantes y analizar los efectos, reacciones indeseables y precauciones frente a su uso. Material y metodos. Se realizo una revision de la literatura en Pubmed con los terminos MeSH: caffeine OR taurine OR gluconates en combinacion con el termino energy drinks con especificadores encontrando 42 articulos, se analizaron los resumenes y se incluyeron 29 articulos. Resultados. Las bebidas energizantes se componen de metilxantinas, carbihodratos, taurina, vitaminas y/o guarana. La mayoria de los efectos estimulantes son a expensas de las altas concentraciones de metilxantinas como la cafeina. Estas altas concentraciones aumentan el riesgo de intoxicacion y dependencia a la cafeina. Se han reportado casos de arritmias, infartos cardiacos, exacerbacion de sintomatologia psiquiatrica y presencia de crisis convulsivas asociadas a su consumo. Ademas, la mezcla con alcohol aumenta los danos relacionados con la intoxicacion alcoholica. Por los efectos diureticos y cardiovasculares no se recomiendan en deportistas. Conclusiones. Se evidencia que los componentes de las bebidas energizantes no son completamente inocuos. Aunque no se conocen los efectos cronicos, la literatura advierte el dano a la salud que puede producirse con la ingesta aguda fuerte o con el consumo frecuente. Es necesario implementar medidas dirigidas a informar las consecuencias de estas sustancias y restringir su consumo en poblaciones de riesgo.",

      "abstract": "It might reasonably be claimed that smoking in moderation is a pleasure - that only heavy smoking is a habit. Pleasure or habit, one British doctor in two does not smoke, and probably more people than ever before are trying to give up smoking. This is the result of the brilliant epidemiological studies which point so strongly to the relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer of the lung, and cigarette smoking and bronchitis (Smoking and Health, Royal College of Physicians 1962). Though the will may be there the way is not always easy, and a number of “anti-smoking” preparations are offered to help keep the smoker from his tobacco. They include astringent lozenges to make smoking unpleasant for him (Finifume; Nicobrevin; Terminex; Ancig; Stanwood treatment), lozenges containing a local anaesthetic and aromatic oils presumably to dull or lull his taste (present in some of the preparations named), and tablets containing lobeline to substitute for nicotine (Lobidan; Cigenda; Lobron). There are also cachous (tablets to be chewed or sucked) which are claimed to antagonise the flavour of tobacco without affecting the taste of food or drink (Nicoban).",

      "title": "The Predicted Impact of Reducing the Nicotine Content in Cigarettes on Alcohol Use",
      "abstract": "Product standards reducing the level of nicotine in cigarettes could significantly improve public health by reducing smoking behavior and toxicant exposure. However, relatively little is known about how the regulatory strategy could impact alcohol use, a closely related health behavior that is also a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. The primary objective of this paper is to predict the effect of nicotine reduction on alcohol use, identify priorities for future research, and highlight areas for mitigating any adverse outcomes. We critically reviewed and integrated literatures examining the effects of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes on smoking-related outcomes (nicotine exposure, nicotine withdrawal, and smoking as a cue to drink) and, in turn, the effects of those outcomes on alcohol use. Current evidence suggests reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes may benefit public health by reducing alcohol use and problematic drinking over time as a consequence of reduced exposure to nicotine and the smoking cues associated with drinking. Nicotine withdrawal could increase risk of drinking, although these effects should be short-lived and could be mitigated by other sources of nicotine. Gender, hazardous drinking, and psychiatric comorbidities are likely to be important moderators of the effects of VLNC cigarettes. It is imperative to broadly assess the public health impact of potential tobacco product regulations by including measures of closely related health behaviors that could be impacted by these interventions. Nicotine reduction in cigarettes may contribute to improved public health through reductions in alcohol use.",

      "abstract": "El uso de la marihuana con fines recreativos o medicinales es tan antigua como el hombre mismo. La marihuana es fumada por sus propiedades alucinogenas. El producto mas importante se obtiene de la planta Cannabis Sativa, la cual crece en todo el mundo. Entre el 9.5% y el 27% de las mujeres embarazadas en los Estados Unidos de Norteamerica, usan Marihuana. El 90% de las mujeres que consumen alguna droga esta en edad reproductiva. El cigarro de la marihuana contiene ademas de monoxido de carbono, carcinogenos, algunos de ellos en concentraciones altas. El delta-9-tetra-hidro-cannabinol (THC) entra en la sangre a traves de los pulmones por el humo inhalado, se calcula que aproximadamente el 50% del THC es absorbido a traves de los pulmones y de ahi directo a la sangre. El THC atraviesa libremente la placenta por lo que afecta prioritariamente al feto. Una de las principales consecuencias por la ingestion de estas sustancias es, la disminucion de la perfusion utero placentaria y con ello una restriccion en el crecimiento del producto, lo cual puede afectar el eje hormonal pituitaria-glandula suprarrenal y con ello la produccion alterada de hormonas y de consecuencias para la fertilidad. Por lo tanto lo mas comun es encontrar productos de bajo peso al nacer o partos prematuros. La utilizacion de la marihuana durante el embarazo tambien se asocia con un incremento en el riesgo de tener problemas neuroconductuales en el producto, ya que el THC y otros canabinoides mimetizan y alteran el sistema endogeno, haciendo que el recien nacido desarrolle problemas importantes de atencion, memoria y uso de habilidades cognitivas. Mucho se ha discutido sobre las malformaciones congenitas producidas por la marihuana, aun hay opinions poco claras al respecto",

Tutun mamullerinden ozellikle sigara kullaniminin baslamasiyla birlikte sigaranin saglik uzerindeki olumsuz etkisi fark edilemeyebilir. Genclik donemlerinde elde edilen sigara aliskanliginin saglik uzerine olan olumsuz etkileri yasamin daha sonraki yillarinda ortaya cikmaktadir. Ulkemizde 10-14 yas arasi 186.000 cocuk her gun tutun ve/veya tutun urunu kullanmaktadir. Yasi 15 ve uzerinde  yaklasik her uc eriskinden biri tutun ve/veya tutun urunu kullanmaktadir. Tip fakultesi egitimi suresince genc hekim adaylari cesitli nedenlerle tutun kullanimina baslamaktadir. Bu calismada amacimiz, hem genclik doneminde olan hem de profesyonel meslek yasamina atilacak olan Tip Fakultesi intorn doktorlarinin tutun kullanim sikligi, miktari ve sigara kullanmaya baslamalarini etkileyen faktorleri degerlendirmektir. Gerec ve Yontem: Tanimlayici tipteki bu calismanin evrenini 484 Donem 6 ogrencisi olusturmaktadir. Evrenin tumune ulasilmasi hedeflenmis 249 kisiye ulasilabilmistir. Veri toplama asamasinda arastirmacilar tarafindan hazirlanan 17 soruluk anket formu katilimcilara dagitilarak gozetim altinda doldurulmustur. Analizlerde SPSS istatistik paket programi kullanilmistir. Istatistiksel anlamlilik siniri alfa=0,05 olarak kabul edilmistir. Tip Fakultesi Dekanligi’ndan kurumsal izin alinmistir. Bulgular: Katilimcilarin %56,2’sinin hic sigara denemedigi saptanmistir. En az 1 kere sigara denemis olanlarin orani %43,8’dir. %4,8’i kullanmis ancak birakmis oldugunu belirtmistir. %17,7’si halen duzenli sigara kullanmaktadir. Arastirmaya katilan ve sigara denemis olan toplam 107 kisinin ilk sigara deneme yaslarina bakildiginda en erken 7 yasinda, en gec 24 yasinda denendigi, ortalama deneme yasinin 18,1 oldugu, tepe degerinin 19 yas oldugu bulunmustur. Katilimcilarin sigara icme davranislarinin baslangic donemlerine ait cevresel ve sosyal etkenlerin etkisi sorgulandiginda en onemli baslama etkeni olarak %49,5 ile merak saptanmistir. Bunun yaninda %48,5 ile can sikintisi ve akran etkisi sigara kullaniminda onemli baslama etkenleri olarak belirlenmistir. Sosyal stres etkeni %42,4 sikligi ile karsimiza cikmistir. Diger etkenler ise %37,4 ile sinav stresi, %28,3 ile ozenme ve %8,1 ile aile etkisi olarak saptanmistir. Katilimcilarin sigara kullanma davranislarinin baslangic donemlerinde yasadiklari ortamin arastirilmasinda en buyuk yuzdeyi ailesiyle evde yasayanlar % 46,4 ile olusturmaktadir. Sonrasinda %33 ile yurtta konaklayan ogrenciler gelmektedir. Evde arkadaslariyla yasayanlar %15,5’lik, evde tek basina yasayanlar ise %5,2’lik orani olusturmaktadir. Katilimcilarin sigara kullanma sikliginin annelerinin sigara kullanma sikligina gore dagilimi degerlendirildiginde istatistiksel olarak anlamli bir fark bulunmustur (p=0,010). Annesi sigara kullanmis olan katilimcilardan %55,3’u hayatinda bir kez olsun sigara kullandigini belirtmistir. Katilimcilarin sigara kullanma sikliginin babalarinin sigara kullanimina gore dagilimi degerlendirildiginde istatistiksel olarak anlamli fark bulunmustur ( p=0,001). Babasi hayatinda bir kez olsun sigara kullanan ogrencilerde sigara kullanma orani %51,7 iken,babasi hayatinda hic sigara kullanmayanlarda sigara kullanma orani %30,2 olarak saptanmistir.

Sonuc ve Oneriler:  Sigara kullanmaya en onemli baslama etkeni olarak %77,7 ile arkadaslarin sigara kullaniyor olmasi bulunmustur. Genclerin sigara icme davranisinda baslatici faktor olarak yer alan akran etkisinin tutun kullanimini azaltmaya yonelik programlarda hedeflenmesi gerekmektedir. Katilimcilarin sigaraya basladigi donemde buyuk kisminin evde kaldigi saptanmistir. Yapilan analizlerde sigara icen ebeveynlere sahip hekim adaylarinin daha yuksek oranda sigara ictigi saptanmistir. Topluma yonelik programlarda tutun kullanimina karsi alinacak onlemlerde ailenin hedeflenmesi hem ebeveynleri hem de gencler uzerinde etkili olabilir. Rol model olabilecek kisilerin (taninmis kisiler, ogretmenler, doktorlar, politikacilar) sigara kullaniminin katilimcilarin sigaraya baslamalarinda etkili bir faktor oldugu gorulmustur. Arastirmamiza katilan intornlerin sadece %44,8’i goreve basladiginda sigara kullanan genc bir hastayi yonlendirmede kendini yeterli bulmaktadir. Tip fakultesi egitiminde sigara birakma danismanligina dair egitim suresinin arttirilmasi ve uygulamaya dayali egitimin yayginlastirilmasi ile hekim adaylarinin konudaki yetkinlikleri arttirabilir. Yapilacak duzenlemelerle tip egitiminde topluma yonelik sigara birakma egitim metotlarinin gelistirilmesiyle aileden baslayarak rol model olacak kisilerin tutun kullaniminin azaltilmasinin, genclerin tutun kullaniminin azaltilmasinda onemli etken olabilir.

      "abstract": "Current smoking cessation treatments largely address pharmacological dependence on nicotine. New approaches are needed that address both nicotine dependence and psychological dependence on cigarettes as the source of nicotine. One such approach is the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content. We reviewed the available literature on the use of reduced–nicotine content cigarettes as a cessation aid. One case series study and trial data indicate that reduction in the level of nicotine in cigarette tobacco can reduce the level of nicotine dependence in smokers and do so without adverse effects on cardiovascular biomarkers or significant compensatory smoking. We identified three clinical trials (total n = 489) that suggest that smokers can dissociate nicotine delivery from the act of smoking if they use reduced–nicotine content cigarettes in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. The identified studies point to a benefit but involved only a small number of participants and provide only limited data on long-term abstinence. More definitive evidence from larger trials with longer follow-up is needed to clarify the role of reduced nicotine cigarettes as an aid to smoking cessation.",

      "abstract": "El consum de tabac es entre dos i quatre vegades mes frequent en pacients amb patologia psiquiatrica. A mes, els pacients amb comorbiditat psiquiatrica fumen mes quantitat de tabac i tenen mes dependencia a la nicotina que la poblacio general. Aquest fet es tradueix amb un major cost per la salut i major cost economic. Tot i que en els darrers anys s’ha reduit la prevalenca de fumadors en els paisos mes desenvolupats, no s’ha observat aquesta reduccio en la poblacio psiquiatrica. Un dels factors clau pot ser l’ajornament sine die de l’abordatge del tabaquisme dels pacients amb psicopatologia per por a descompensacions psiquiatriques o a recaigudes en consum d’ altres toxics, encara que vulguin deixar de fumar. Aquest es un fet frequent en pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol. D’altra banda, tot i que els pacients amb psicopatologia poden deixar de fumar, sovint l’exit dels tractaments es menor. Aixi, no queda clar quin es el paper que juguen els antecedents de depressio major i la simptomatologia depressiva present a l’ inici del tractament per abandonar el tabac. Tampoc es coneix si hi ha trets de la personalitat, segons el model de personalitat de Zuckerman, que dificultin l’abstinencia. Els objectius son: 1. Analitzar quin es el millor moment per a iniciar un tractament del tabaquisme en pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol; el mateix moment que inicien tractament per a l’alcohol o sis mesos despres. 2. Avaluar l’ impacte dels antecedents de depressio major i de la simptomatologia depressiva, en l’abstinencia tabaquica. 3. Mesurar quins trets de personalitat, segons el model de Zuckerman, s’associen a major risc de dependencia nicotinica, major consum i risc de recaiguda. Les dades d’aquesta tesi venen de dos estudis diferents: el primer amb poblacio amb dependencia de l’alcohol i el segon amb poblacio general. En el primer estudi, un grup de pacients rep tractament estandard per l’alcohol i per deixar de fumar simultaniament o en diferit, primer per l’alcohol i sis mesos mes tard pel tabac. En el segon estudi, s’ avalua l’ impacte dels antecedents de depressio major, simptomatologia depressiva i trets de personalitat en els resultats d’una intervencio en tabaquisme. En tots els casos, la intervencio per deixar de fumar combina tractament cognitiu-conductual i farmacoterapia. Els resultats indiquen que els pacients amb dependencia de l’alcohol poden deixar de fumar i beure a la vegada sense que augmenti el risc de recaiguda en l’ alcohol, tampoc afecta a l’ adherencia, ni hi ha diferencies en la taxa d’ abstinencia del consum de tabac, comparat amb fer tractament per l’alcohol i despres pel tabac. D’altra banda, els antecedents de depressio major no disminueixen la probabilitat d’abstinencia de consum tabac. En canvi, la simptomatologia depressiva a l’ inici del tractament per deixar de fumar, si minva la probabilitat d’abstinencia. Per ultim, s’evidencia l’existencia de trets de personalitat diferencials segons el sexe, que impliquen major risc de dependencia i recaiguda. En homes, un baix nivell de sociabilitat es relaciona amb major nivells de dependencia, mentre que no es troben trets relacionats amb major dependencia en dones. Majors nivells d’impulsivitat i sociabilitat es relacionen amb major risc de recaiguda en homes i dones, respectivament. Aquesta tesi aporta dades a favor de la rellevancia d’identificar aspectes psicopatologics i de personalitat en pacients que inicien tractament per a la deshabituacio tabaquica. La identificacio de variables associades amb la recaiguda en el consum de tabac hauria de permetre orientar esforcos a minimitzar el seu efecte i millorar els resultats de les intervencions en tabaquisme.",

      "title": "Poisoning by Medical Plants.",
      "abstract": "Background Herbal medications are becoming increasingly popular with the impression that they cause fewer side effects in comparison with synthetic drugs; however, they may considerably contribute to acute or chronic incidents. Poison centers receive more than 100000 patients exposed to toxic plants. Most of these cases are inconsiderable toxicities involving pediatric ingestions of medicinal plants in low quantity. In most cases of serious poisonings, patients are adults who have either mistakenly consumed a poisonous as edible or ingested the regarding to its medicinal properties for therapy or toxic properties for illegal aims. Methods In this article, we review the main human toxic plants causing mortality or the ones which account for emergency medical visits. Articles addressing plant poisoning in online databases were listed in order to establish the already reported human toxic cases. Results The current review introduces herbal plants toxicity and herb-drug interactions to warn the health professionals about possible consequences of unconscious uses of medicinal plants. The reported cases extracted from our prepared database were classified on the basis of the main toxic effects of plants, and the most prominent constituents of the plants which are responsible for specific toxic effects. Conclusion Considering the long history of consumption of herbal medicines in different societies, people may wrongly think that medicinal plants are fully harmless and nontoxic. Prescription, preparation and consumption regulations of medicinal plants are not clear and strict as well as their marketing regulations that differ from country to country. The extensive and various consumption of medicinal plants without adequate observation is the most important reason for by medicinal plants.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews the effects of alcohol on human psychomotor performance and cognitive function. It concentrates particularly on effects on reaction time and on skills related to car driving. The effects of alcohol on performance are very variable at low doses (under 1 g per kg body weight). The variability is due to the different measures and methods employed by the researchers and to the large interindividual and interoccasional differences in the effects of alcohol. That is, alcohol affects different people in different ways and it affects the same person differently on separate occasions. Greater performance deficits are observed as the dose increases and as the tasks become more complex. Although results vary, both nicotine and caffeine appear to antagonize the detrimental effects of alcohol on performance. Many other drugs interact with alcohol, the most important of which are sedative agents that can combine synergistically with alcohol to produce profound psychomotor and cognitive impairment. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Summary It has been argued that the phenomenon of alcoholics experiencing mood deterioration during a heavy drinking bout discredits the Tension Reduction Hypothesis of alcohol consumption [6]. An experiment is described which sought to illustrate two ways in which this phenomenon and the hypothesis are compatible. Nine male alcoholics consumed 6gm of alcohol per kg bodyweight in 16 equal doses over two days. Ratings of mood and related physiological indices were used. In the long‐term the physiological measures were elevated on the second drinking day and yet individual doses of alcohol lowered these throughout. Severely alcohol dependent subjects showed corresponding effects for subjective ratings ie long‐term mood deterioration with short‐term improvement. All subjects expected continuing to drink to be reinforcing relative to stopping. Thus alcohol may retain tension‐reducing properties, and alcoholics may expect these, even if affective state was worsened overall during a drinking bout.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol is one of the most common beverages consumed in today's society. Its vast popularity at various levels makes it one of the highest causes of driving fatalities, especially in the United States. Reports and statistics state that over 65 million people are struggling with alcoholism disorder. Alcoholism is a medical, social and economic problems where treatment methods mostly include difficult and long-lasting psychotherapy and in some cases, quite controversial pharmacological approaches. No medicine can 'cure' alcohol use disorder, but some can help you to recover. They can make drinking less enjoyable so you don't want to do it as such; e.g., disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, etc. But there are various side effects of synthetic drugs such as excessive use of acamprosate may results in abdominal pain, confusion, and increase urination. Naltrexone results stomach cramping, anxiety, etc. Excessive use of disulfiram shows polyneuritis, hepatitis, acneiform eruption, etc. The developments of alcoholism remedies have medical, social, and economical significance. In view of the adverse behavioral effects of synthetic drugs, the development of low toxicity and high efficiency medicines derived from natural products exhibits expansive market prospects. A 24number of medicinal plants and pure natural compounds are reported to have preventive and therapeutic effect on alcoholism and alcohol dependency, but their constituents, efficacy, and mechanism of action are mostly unknown so far. The reduction of alcohol absorption from the gastrointestinal system appears to be a common feature among most of the plants. The aim of this book chapter is to provide an overview of effective natural products for the prevention and treatment of chronic alcohol-use disorder.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide, tobacco use is considered the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. The most common form of tobacco use is cigarette smoking. Smoking increases a person’s risk for diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Associated with these increased risks for disease is a shortened lifespan in smokers. Research has also shown that cigarette smoking alters the body’s response to exercise. Nicotine and carbon monoxide are two compounds in cigarette smoke that may affect cardiorespiratory function, thereby modifying the body’s exercise response. Additionally, research has shown that compared to nonsmokers, smokers demonstrate a greater reliance on glucose as a fuel source during exercise. A focus of this review is on the cigarette smoke compounds nicotine and carbon monoxide and the mechanisms by which these compounds affect the human body. Also addressed are the physiological effects of cigarette smoking on exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, and substrate utilization.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of narcotics is one of the problems the international world is confronted with nowadays; its direct or indirect effects lead to the conclusion that it represents a worrying phenomenon meant to be taken into account by the international programs of co-operation. In contrast with the mature population, the younger population is much more receptive to the new, much more attracted by new experiments and, consequently, by risks. The narcotics flagellum is one of the most complex, profound and dramatic phenomena met with in the contemporary world. Narcotization is the morbid habit of repeatedly taking and using ever higher doses of more or less toxic substances able to generate a psychological and physical addiction to them. Unhappily due to the lack of information, people think that the illegal substances only – heroine, marijuana, cocaine, etc. – are considered drugs. Not long ago there appeared the so-called “mixes of ethno-botanical plants” that are perfectly legal, and many consumers have replaced narcotics - as marijuana, for example - with plant mixes. According to explanations given by the Ethno-botanical Explanatory Dictionary, ethno-biology is a branch that studies the mutual relationship between man and plant. In Romania, ethno-botanical plants are sold under the generic names of “aroma therapeutic” or “ethnobotanical” plants. The numerous researches meant to decode the molecular and biochemical structure of these herbs, the researchers found that consumers are described as facing hallucinogenic effects caused by some synthetic substances - cannabinoids - added by manufacturers.",

Rehabilitation therapy is often long and has a high failure rate. For this reason, there is a need for extensive action to minimise the negative effects of psychoactive substance use. Substitution therapy is one of the programmes included in the harm reduction strategy. It involves the replacement of an illicit drug with a legal substance with similar or identical pharmacological effects and is applied in drug addiction therapy. In the case of nicotine addiction, substitution therapy involves taking the same psychoactive substance (nicotine) in a form which is devoid of the majority of other toxic substances that are found in tobacco smoke. The introduction of alternative forms of nicotine supply (electronic cigarettes, non-smoking tobacco products) have renewed the controversy around the topic of efficacy of harm reduction involving the replacement of traditional tobacco products with those with reduced emission of toxic substances, but which still deliver nicotine. According to the opponents of substitution therapy, it prevents one from achieving abstinence that allows for full elimination of harm generated by psychoactive substances. Finding a common platform between the proponents of harm reduction and advocates of complete abstinence-based therapy would be of benefit to the addicted individuals.",

      "abstract": "Drug dependence is generally thought to involve a loss or reduction of individual autonomy. Yet of the 11 million people in the UK (27 per cent of the population aged 16–74) who have ever used illicit drugs at some point in their life, probably no more than 300,000 (1%) are drug dependent. Many commentators find the apparently self-destructive behaviour of problematic drug users difficult to explain. According to rational theory, choices are made with respect to a long timeframe so as to maximize overall utility. Under maximization, individuals cannot gradually slide towards a very high level of drug use at the expense of other activities as this would reduce their overall utility. The key to understanding drug dependence is that it involves ‘matching’ different behavioural combinations at any given point in time that do not take account of long-term consequences. There is growing evidence that drug users are much more likely to match compared to non-drug users and that they have difficulty in learning to maximize. We argue that current practice within the UK criminal justice system is implicitly based on the idea that relearning the value of alternative behaviours can lead to drug use desistance.",

Experienced marijuana smokers in this sample are involved in the drug scene in different ways.

      "title": "Smoking Cessation Treatment for Adolescents",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cigarette smoking in the adolescent population remains a public health concern. A significant portion of the adolescent population currently uses tobacco. Nicotine is particularly addicting in adolescents, and quitting is difficult. The goals for adolescent cigarette smoking efforts must include both primary prevention and smoking cessation. Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies—including nicotine patches, gum, and nasal spray—have been studied to a limited extent in the adolescent population. Varenicline has not been evaluated as a treatment modality in adolescents. Long-term quit rates in the pharmacotherapy trials have not been optimal; however, decreases in cigarettes smoked per day have been observed. Several evidencebased guidelines include recommendations for smoking cessation in adolescents that include counseling and pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy may be instituted for some adolescents in addition to counseling and behavioral interventions. Therapy should be individualized, based on smoking patterns, patient preferences, and concomitant disease states. Smoking cessation support for parents should be instituted as well. The pharmacist can play a large role in helping the adolescent quit smoking. Further studies evaluating pharmacotherapy options for smoking cessation in adolescents are necessary. If pharmacotherapy is used, it should be individualized and combined with psychosocial and behavioral interventions.",

      "abstract": "1. Nicotine is the most important poison in tobacco smoke. 2. Pyridine bases, in the quantities in which they are present in tobacco smoke, are not injurious to the smoker. 3. Smoking raises the blood‐pressure by vaso‐constriction, accelerates the heart and respiration, and increases intestinal movements. In excess, cerebral depression may occur, and, with the coexisting depression of the vaso‐motor centre, may lower the blood‐pressure to such an extent that collapse may be induced. 4. The amount of nicotine inhaled during smoking depends not so much on the tobacco smoked, as upon the form in which it is smoked. The greater the condensation area between the point of combustion and the entrance into the mouth, the more nicotine will be inhaled. 5. Arterial disease may result from prolonged tobacco smoking.",

Methods It is a cautionary tale for palliative care specialists, perhaps unaware of the effect of cigarette smoke on metabolism of this antipsychotic, to be aware of. Results Following specialist advice and change of antipsychotic medication, this patient’s condition improved to the point that he was discharged from the hospice. Conclusion Palliative care specialists should be aware that reducing cigarette consumption can alter metabolism of clozapine, potentially causing drug accumulation and toxicity with features which mimic deterioration towards end of life. Specialist advice should be sought in such a situation.",

      "abstract": "One factor that may encourage smoking despite its known adverse health consequences is its association with weight control. Middle-aged and older smokers weigh less than comparably aged non-smokers but smoking has minimal impact on body weight in young smokers. Smoking cessation produces weight gain in both men and women, although the magnitude of this gain and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Physical activity does not appear to be a factor. The effect of smoking cessation on energy intake is complicated, with few studies looking at changes after long periods, but there do seem to be sustained increases in energy intake in women. Removal of the acute increases in metabolic rate caused by smoking may contribute to post-cessation weight gain but there are no reliable long-term changes in metabolic rate after cessation. Behavioural and pharmacologic interventions to prevent weight gain after cessation are described.",

Nicotine withdrawal, which manifests itself in the form of severe physiological symptoms, becomes a serious obstacle to getting rid of it. Therefore, many smokers, realizing the harm of nicotine to health, are not able to give it up.

Some help to survive a difficult period of withdrawal relatively without harm to the body, others are not so safe.

Recreational misadventure, because of incorrect dosage or mixing multiple substances, is a common reason for teenagers presenting to hospital with toxidromes. Death from club drug overdose is more likely to be associated with suicidal intent, related risky behaviour and trauma, as well as the inherent toxicity of the drug itself.

Marijuana use has increased dramatically in the United States over the last decade. With increasing public acceptance and legalization of marijuana, various adverse side effects have become more prominent. Marijuana has been shown to disrupt gastrointestinal tract motility by inhibiting cholinergic mechanisms. Here we describe four cases of AI who are chronic marijuana users.

It is not appropriate to suggest that alcohol use should be eliminated but it is important that we take steps to minimise harm produced by intake of inappropriate amounts of this drug. Many alcohol related problems are irreversible once established and thus it is imperative that information be made available to the public and to health care workers to help minimise problems before they become permanently established. It is suggested that harm may be minimised by a number of strategies that include measures to: 1. Prevent the desire or need to drink excessively. 2. Prevent the ingestion of excessive amounts of alcohol. 3. Prevent the effects of excessive intake by protecting susceptible tissues. 4. Treating tissue damage early to prevent progressive injury. Early detection and intervention must play an increasing role in any attempt to minimise alcohol related problems.",

The use of psychotropic substances is as old as human history. Some use drugs as part of religious observations. The majority of people who partake of drugs use them for recreational purposes. Some become addicted and may cause harm to themselves, their families and society. If drugs are bad it seems logical to wage war on them.

      "title": "Updated review on successful control with nicotine replacement therapy for nicotine withdrawal symptoms",
      "abstract": "Nicotine use as a tool for quitting smoking has a good safety history. Animal studies suggest that nicotine may adversely affect cognitive development in adolescence, but the relevance of these findings to human brain development is disputed. At low amounts, it has a mild analgesic effect. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, \"nicotine is not generally considered to be a carcinogen.\" The Surgeon General of the United States indicates that evidence is inadequate to infer the presence or absence of a causal relationship between exposure to nicotine and risk for cancer. Tobacco is dangerous. According to one study trusted source, smoking-related diseases are responsible for about 4,35,000 deaths per year in the United States. That’s about 1 in every 5 deaths in the United States. Stopping smoking, no matter how long you have smoked, can greatly benefit your health. Nicotine creates pleasant feelings in the body and mind. When you use tobacco, your brain releases neurotransmitters such dopamine, the feel-good chemical. This creates a brief feeling of contentment and pleasure. In humans, nicotine from tobacco induces stimulation and pleasure, and reduces stress and anxiety. Smokers come to use nicotine to modulate their level of arousal and for mood control in daily life. Smoking may improve concentration, reaction time, and performance of certain tasks. When a person stops smoking, nicotine withdrawal symptoms emerge. These include irritability, depressed mood, restlessness, anxiety, problems getting along with friends and family, difficulty concentrating, increased hunger and eating, insomnia, and craving for tobacco. Nicotine withdrawal in untreated smokers produces mood disturbances comparable in intensity to those seen in psychiatric out patients. Generally it has been found that nicotine replacement therapies actually give you small amounts of nicotine through a product like gum or a skin patch. While you’ll continue to get some nicotine in your system, you won’t be exposed to any of the other harmful chemicals that are found in tobacco.",

Nowadays apart from alcohol and tobacco new designed, psychoactive substances known as \"smart drugs\" or \"legal highs\" are available. Intensive development of their market is taking place in the last few years which is difficult to overcome by regulations only. Toxicological tests used now are not able to detect the presence of many such substances in the body. Designer drugs cause the interest of young people even from small towns and many times taking them give effects requiring medical help. Caffeine is also a psychoactive substance but depending on the dose it can have positive or detrimental effect. Recently there are more and more products with caffeine, especially drinks and dietary supplements, what can cause the increase of consumption of caffeine. Children are particularly exposed to the adverse effect of high consumption of caffeine because of their small body weight and development of the central nervous system. This article presents actual data about the market of designer drugs, frequency of using them, consumption of caffeine by children and teenagers and about the impact of these substances on the organism.",

      "title": "Abstract CN02-03: Quitting or switching? Health benefits and risk of electronic cigarettes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although the best way for smokers to avoid the health risks associated with smoking is to quit smoking altogether, for those who do continue to smoke the application of an exposure reduction (“harm reduction”) strategy could result in substantial reductions in mortality and morbidity. Many smokers are concerned about the health effects of smoking and might be interested in trying new products if they believed this would reduce their health risk. The concept of exposure reduction is based on the principle that if dangerous behavior, like smoking, is likely to continue, the harm caused should be minimized. One such approach for continuing smokers would be to promote the substitution of alternative, less toxic means of delivering nicotine, assuming that these were proven to be less hazardous than tobacco smoking and did not cause any additional health risks. Electronic nicotine inhalers, commonly called electronic cigarettes or “e-cigarettes”, represent a new stage in which nicotine is delivered in a method that simulates smoking but without involving a tobacco combustion process. E-cigarette are battery-powered devices that provide inhaled doses of nicotine by delivering a vaporized liquid nicotine solution, usually including propylene glycol or glycerin. The nicotine is extracted from tobacco leaves (in the same way the pharmaceutical industry obtains nicotine for NRT production), and is then diluted and introduced into the e-cigarette's cartridge. In addition to delivering nicotine, the vapor also provides a flavor and physical sensation similar to that of inhaled tobacco smoke, although no tobacco or combustion is actually involved in its operation. When a user initiates inhalation into the device, air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the nicotine solution stored in the mouthpiece cartridge. It is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. On some models an LED on the opposite end of the device is activated during inhalation to serve as an indicator of use as well as simulating the glow of burning tobacco. E-cigarettes have been shown to reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms in abstinent smokers and, as nicotine is delivered without tobacco combustion, are thought to be substantially safer than cigarettes. While e-cigarette use is rapidly increasing, relatively little is known about their efficacy for smoking cessation, particularly compared with established nicotine-containing pharmacological aids. One randomized controlled trial by Bullen et al. showed that e-cigarettes are at least as effective as nicotine patches for smoking cessation. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of participants in this study engaged in harm reduction, becoming long-term e-cigarette users and reducing their conventional cigarette consumption. Thus, against the backdrop of ongoing debates on tighter regulation of e-cigarettes, a sole focus on smoking cessation may be misguided. From a public health perspective, the permanent switch from combustible to noncombustible products is an important endpoint in itself. Nonetheless, the finding that e-cigarettes are at least as effective as existing licensed, nicotine-containing smoking cessation products should go some way towards easing, if not completely allaying, the fears of many health professionals observing their fast uptake among smokers. Distributors of e-cigarettes promote the product as completely free of harmful substances. However, nicotine solutions used in e-cigarettes vary with respect to concentrations of toxicants, and the quality control in e cigarette manufacturing is questionable. Although a number of toxicants have been identified in e-cigarette vapors, the levels of these toxicants are orders of magnitude lower than those found in cigarette smoke, but higher than those found in Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) products. Some studies suggest that vapor from e-cigarette is significantly less cytotoxic compared to tobacco smoke. One study found that after switching from tobacco to electronic cigarettes nicotine exposure is unchanged while exposure to selected toxicants is substantially reduced. Although it cannot be said that currently marketed e-cigarettes are safe, e-cigarette vapor is likely to be much less toxic than cigarette smoke. The devices likely pose less direct hazard to the individual smoker than tobacco cigarettes and might help smokers quit smoking or reduce harm by smoking fewer cigarettes. The use of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy among cigarette smokers who are unable to quit, warrants further studies. Further research is needed to evaluate long term effects of switching, including the health effects of continued use of e-cigarettes. Citation Format: Maciej Lukasz Goniewicz. Quitting or switching?

      "abstract": "INTRODUCAO O uso abusivo de substâncias psicoativas como a cocaina e um grande problema de saude publica, e quando utilizada durante a gestacao compromete o crescimento e desenvolvimento da crianca. O uso desta substancia durante o periodo gestacional tem aumentado drasticamente durante as ultimas decadas. Em alguns casos o recem-nascido exposto a cocaina, aparentemente, nao apresenta qualquer tipo de comprometimento ou problemas neurologicos, entretanto, com o passar do tempo manifesta alteracoes que comprometem sua condicao fisica e neurologica.  OBJETIVO; Descrever o que a literatura tem apontado sobre o uso da cocaina por mulheres durante a gestacao e as consequencias para as criancas Metodologia: Trata-se de uma revisao da literatura. RESULTADOS E DISCUSSAO: A exposicao fetal diante a cocaina provoca diversos desfechos neonatais desfavoraveis para bebe, tanto fisiologica quanto psicologicamente. A literatura aponta como principais consequencias cefalicas reduzidas para a idade, dificuldade no ganho de peso e alteracoes no desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor, podendo acarretar disturbios comportamentais, de linguagem e deficit motor. Alem disso, a cocaina, suprime o apetite materno e coopera para deficiencia nutricional que, por conseguinte, prejudica os depositos de gordura fetais e diminui a massa corporal. CONCLUSAO: Destaca-se, o grande desafio aos profissionais de saude, em especial aqueles da Estrategia Saude da Familia em planejar estrategias de prevencao de drogas, em especial no periodo gestacional, bem como utilizar a Politica de Reducao de danos. Outro cuidado importante e o acompanhamento minucioso dos recem nascidos filhos de maes usuarias de cocaina, com vistas a deteccao precoce de alteracoes.  Aliado a isso, faz-se necessario o acolhimento e busca ativa dessas maes e suas criancas a fim de elaborar estrategias com foco na promocao da saude e a qualidade de vidas criancas, transmitindo informacoes sobre os riscos inerentes a cada fase do desenvolvimento infantil, Por fim, acredita-se que os resultados do presente estudo possam contribuir para o estabelecimento de acoes educativas e preventivas voltadas para uso de cocaina e as consequencias para crianca.",

Subjects (4,148) were questioned about their use of benzodiazepines of whom 1,284 were also questioned about their alcohol, cigarette and caffeine consumption. Data were examined to find possible multiple substance misuse. No strong evidence could be found. People taking benozodiazepines at the time of the survey consumed significantly less alcohol than non‐users or past users. Cigarette consumption was found to be increased in current and past benzodiazepine users. Subgroups of benzodiazepine users, defined as‘high users’,‘dosage escalators’or‘chronic users’were also examined. Again no strong evidence of multiple substance misuse could be found. However, high users and dosage escalators did smoke more than others. Concurrent misuse of benzodiazepines and other legally available psychoactive substances is not common in the general population.",

Individuals who are susceptible to addiction include those who are increasingly exposed to the addictive agents. Nicotine use and abuse of alcohol are the most abused substances in the globe. These substances are responsible for the increasing mortality in both developing and developed worlds. The risk factors for addiction range from genetic factors to environmental factors. Alcohol dependence is mostly attributed to the short (S) allele. Similarly, this dependence is also linked to the environmental factors. Like alcohol, nicotine dependence is also linked to genetic factors. Various genetic studies indicate that nicotine dependence is heritable as there are many genes responsible for inheritance of smoking behavior. This study however notes that addiction to drugs is as a result of either heritable or inheritable factors. The study used 2000 smokers, 3000 alcohol addicts and 3000 cannabis dependents as the population for research. The researchers evaluated the contributions of genes to substance dependence. The results of the study showed that genetic and environmental factors contributed significantly to the addiction disorder.",

As a result, the disposition to experience these desires is very persistent over the long-term, manifesting itself in particular episodes of wanting to use drugs that recur with great frequency. Both the persistence and the recurrence of these desires, it is argued, contribute to a diminished ability to respond to relevant reasons that speak against drug use.",

The question raised is thus: will an adolescent experimenter be a non smoker, an experimenter for ever, a regular smoker, light or heavy? This short review shows that there are numerous factors from genetics, to familial environment not limited to tobacco issues, smoking situation at school as well as school performances of the student, and also individual psychological characteristics. The experimenter is a very good target for smoking cessation actions and should deserve particular attention from preventive medicine and, thus, from school medicine, before he becomes a regular smoker, who will be more resistant to smoking cessation programs.",

Many cases of cardiovascular events have, however, been related to a cannabis consumption [2-4], and cases of acute ischemia or thrombosis even on the ground of normal coronary arteries have been reported.",

      "abstract": "For patients who have difficulty swallowing, a common solution is to crush tablets or open capsules. What are the consequences of this practice? We reviewed the main evidence available using the standard Prescrire methodology. The clinical consequences for the patient of crushing tablets or opening capsules can be serious: alteration of the drug's absorption can result in sometimes fatal overdose, or conversely underdosing, rendering the treatment ineffective. When it disrupts a drug's sustained-release properties, the active ingredient is no longer released and absorbed gradually, resulting in overdose. When a gastro-resistant layer is destroyed by crushing, underdosing is likely. The active ingredient released may degrade on contact with light, moisture or the food with which it is mixed for administration. The person who crushes the tablets or opens the capsules is exposed to drug particles, which may be carcinogenic, teratogenic or fetotoxic. They are sometimes allergenic. In practice, there are many drugs that should never be crushed or opened. Before crushing a tablet or opening a capsule, it is better to consider and research the impact it will have on the drug's effects. It is sometimes preferable to use a different dosage form, or a different active ingredient.",

      "abstract": "Australia has one of the highest rates in the world of the use of the crystalline form of methamphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant that is often associated with a chronic, relapsing dependency. Methamphetamine use is associated with both acquisitive and violent offending, which cause substantial personal and societal costs. Whilst the short-term euphoria and stimulation provide a positive reinforcement to methamphetamine use, the aversive states of withdrawing from methamphetamine and the associated craving, which may last up to five weeks into abstinence, underlie the negative reinforcement to continued methamphetamine use. Although many methamphetamine-dependent users experience high levels of psychological distress, it is likely that less than half engage with treatment or support services, and current intervention and treatment programmes have high discontinuation rates. Stigma and discrimination, even from paramedics and health clinicians, are prominent barriers to methamphetamine-dependent users accessing treatment in Australia.",

      "title": "Smoking Sue e os Efeitos do Tabagismo",
      "abstract": "CARACTERIZACAO DO PROBLEMA: Ha milenios a humanidade convive com substancias que tem a capacidade de produzir alteracoes fisicas e mentais, dentre elas o tabaco. Ao longo deste periodo fatores culturais e sociais (como festas e comemoracoes) estao relacionados ao consumo do mesmo (BERTOLOTE, 2010). O tabaco e definido como qualquer preparacao das folhas da Nicotiana tabacum proveniente de uma planta nativa da America, sendo seu principal ingrediente a nicotina, que e um agente psicoativo. Ja o tabagismo e um vocabulo de origem francesa que se refere a condicao de dependencia da nicotina, em que o fumante apresenta graves sintomas de abstinencia (BERTOLOTE, 2010). A dependencia e caracterizada pela ocorrencia de fenomenos comportamentais, cognitivos e fisiologicos que se desenvolvem apos o uso repetido de uma dada substância e com a cessacao ou reducao do uso das mesmas, ocorre a abstinencia que geralmente e acompanhada por sinais de alteracoes fisiologicas (BERTOLOTE, 2010). O tabagismo constitui um importante problema de saude, colocando-se entre as causas mais comuns de morte por neoplasias malignas. Segundo Bogliolo (2011, p.430), “sua incidencia vem crescendo nos ultimos 60 anos, coincidindo com o aumento paralelo na producao de tabaco e no consumo de cigarros”. E tornou-se responsavel por cerca de 90% dos casos de câncer de pulmao nos homens e 70% em mulheres. Cerca de 20% dos fumantes desenvolvem câncer pulmonar. O tabagismo aumenta a chance de câncer de pulmao, de forma proporcional ao tamanho da exposicao considerando entao o numero de cigarros fumados/dia x tempo. Assim, quem fuma charutos ou cachimbo tambem tem mais risco de desenvolver câncer de pulmao. Mesmo sem inalar, existe o aumento do risco de tumores de cabeca e pescoco nos usuarios. Ha tambem maior risco em fumantes passivos, que vivem em exposicao prolongada ao ar aonde alguem esta fumando. Estima-se que a cada tres cigarros fumados por um fumante, o individuo que divide o ambiente esta inalando um cigarro inteiro (MARTINS; BRANDAO NETO; LADEIRA; DIEHL; TAKAHASKI; 2007). Na decada de 90 houve uma queda de casos e de mortes em homens com aumento em mulheres, implicando diretamente no aumento do numero de mulheres tabagistas (MARTINS; BRANDAO NETO; LADEIRA; DIEHL; TAKAHASKI; 2007). Segundo o INCA (2011) O tabagismo passivo e a 3a maior causa de morte evitavel no mundo, subsequente ao tabagismo ativo e ao consumo excessivo de alcool. O ar poluido contem, em media, tres vezes mais nicotina, tres vezes mais monoxido de carbono, e ate cinquenta vezes mais substâncias cancerigenas do que a fumaca que entra pela boca do fumante depois de passar pelo filtro do cigarro. Neste sentido, este estudo tem por objetivo relatar a experiencia de academicas do curso de enfermagem na realizacao de uma atividade educativa sobre o Tabagismo e doencas associadas, com enfoque especial no câncer de pulmao. DESCRICAO DA EXPERIENCIA: Trata-se de um relato sobre a experiencia obtida por meio de uma exposicao realizada no evento intitulado EXPOCEEP que se realizou no Centro Estadual de Educacao Profissional Pedro Boaretto Neto (CEEP), na cidade de Cascavel, estado do Parana, nos dias 21 e 22 de outubro do ano de 2011, no periodo noturno. A EXPOCEEP e um evento realizado anualmente e tem como objetivo a apresentacao a comunidade dos cursos da escola e atividades desenvolvidas pelos alunos. As academicas de enfermagem que vivenciaram essa experiencia sao oriundas da Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana (UNIOESTE) e participantes do Programa Institucional de Bolsa de Iniciacao a Docencia (PIBID) o qual possibilitou a participacao das mesmas nessa atividade. Trata-se de uma apresentacao dialogada, expositiva e nao-formal na qual utilizou-se para demonstracao a Smoking Sue, que representava o ato de fumar: o cigarro era introduzido na boca da boneca e aceso. Em seguida as academicas simulavam o ato, apertando e soltando a pera que representava o torax da boneca; apos isso a fumaca inalada passava pelo tubo de ensaio que representava o pulmao humano e as substâncias toxicas depositavam-se no tubo. A medida que os cigarros eram consumidos pela boneca, aumentava o deposito de substâncias no tubo, conferindo-lhe um aspecto escurecido, demonstrando as alteracoes pulmonares ao longo da vida de um fumante. O local escolhido foi o patio da escola, pois era um local com grande fluxo de pessoas alem de ter possibilitado o desenvolvimento da atividade minimizando os efeitos da fumaca do cigarro. Ao longo da demonstracao, as academicas abordaram conteudos referentes ao tabaco. EFEITOS ALCANCADOS: Acreditamos que a atividade tenha sido exitosa, pois a comunidade que se aproximava do local onde ocorria a apresentacao, sendo varios deles atraidos pela boneca exposta, inclusive as criancas. Houve grande interesse sobre o funcionamento da Smoking Sue e do assunto em questao nos dois dias de exposicao. Alguns visitantes participaram ativamente, relatando experiencias e esclarecendo suas duvidas com as academicas, sendo as mais comuns acerca da dependencia, fumantes passivos e câncer de pulmao. O objetivo do trabalho nao teve enfoque quantitativo, entretanto, observou-se que grande parte dos visitantes relatou ser fumante, ja ter fumado e/ou conhecer alguem nessa situacao. RECOMENDACOES: Acredita-se que essa atividade educativa tenha possibilitado esclarecimento quanto aos riscos do consumo do tabaco para a saude humana. Confiamos que atividades educativas semelhantes a essa aqui apresentada sao importantes para a formacao academica dos estudantes de enfermagem e as mesmas devem estar presentes nos curriculos de graduacao.

      "abstract": "Abstract : Addiction and drug abuse are pervasive in society, and can result in illness, legal and financial trouble, and even death for dependent users. Licit substances, including alcohol, are widely available, easily obtainable, and relatively inexpensive. More than 75% of Americans have used alcohol at least once in their lifetime, and more than half of adults are current drinkers. Unlike most other drugs, alcohol may be health-promoting in low to moderate doses. Excessive alcohol intake can cause serious immediate and long-term consequences to the drinker and to others. There is substantial anecdotal, clinical, and some experimental evidence that environmental factors, especially stress and social environment, affect alcohol self-administration. Stress often is associated with increased alcohol consumption. Social enrichment decreases drug self-administration, but there is mixed evidence regarding social enrichment and alcohol intake. These relationships lack experimental examination and the mechanisms underlying these relationships are not clear. The purpose of this research project was to examine experimentally the individual and combined effects of stress and social enrichment on alcohol self-administration (in two bottle choice and operant self-administration paradigms) and alcohols effects on dopaminergic and serotonergic responses in the brain (nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortex) and on psychological constructs (anxiety via open field center time and depression via forced swim test) in male Wistar rats. The major hypotheses were: (1) stress would increase alcohol consumption and increase alcohols effects on the stress response; (2) alcohol would decrease the biological and attenuate the psychological stress response; and (3) social enrichment would decrease alcohol consumption, attenuate the stress response, and attenuate alcohols effects on the stress response.",

The main causes of drug taking, listed by the soldiers, include: stress associated with the service and noticeable pleasure. Soldiers taking drugs buy them from their civilian colleagues, from dealers in the area of the unit or the neighborhood.

Einen übergewichtigen Diabetiker zu motivieren, adäquat zu essen und das Gewicht möglichst schnell zu normalisieren, gelingt häufig trotz intensiver Unterstützung nicht. Die gleiche Erfahrung machen wir tagtäglich mit Suchtkranken: Trotz intensiver Motivierung zur Abstinenz gelingt die Abstinenz nicht oder nur partiell. Was hat zu diesem hohen und lange Zeit singulär bestehendem therapeutischem Zielanspruch der Abstinenz beigetragen? Hier können vielleicht die Entwicklung der Suchttherapie aus einer kirchlichen Tradition mit einer Anfälligkeit für Dogmen, die Erfahrung der Ohnmacht Betroffener und deren Einfluss auf therapeutische Ansätze in der Selbsthilfe oder auch die Funktion des Suchtkranken als Objekt von Phantasien und Neidprojektionen seitens der Gesellschaft oder der Therapeuten genannt werden. In keinem Bereich der psychischen Erkrankungen ist der Anteil von Betroffenen in spezifischer Behandlung so gering wie in der Sucht, bei Alkoholkranken wird nur jeder 10. von spezifischer Therapie erreicht.

      "abstract": "There is ongoing debate within the public health community as to whether e-cigarettes have a potential role in smoking cessation; whether use of e-cigarettes can reduce harm for individual users; whether widespread use of the devices has the potential to reduce or increase population-level harm; and how best to regulate e-cigarettes to minimize both individual and population-level harm.but Although the long-term effects of e-cigarette use are not known, producing nicotine aerosol from a solution rather than by burning tobacco gives rise to fewer harmful substances than cigarette smoke does to smokers and non-smokers.Because of the likely lesser health risks associated with vaping, some experts advocate wider availability and softer regulation, and see e-cigarettes as holding great potential to help smokers quit or switch to a harm-reducing way to consume nicotine.Others argue that it is not sound public health policy to allow e-cigarettes onto the market until such time as robust evidence is available supporting the safety of e-cigarettes and their efficacy in reducing harm.They cite the addictiveness of nicotine, and the potential for harm from ongoing use of e-cigarettes compared with complete cessation of all nicotine and tobacco products.Other serious issues include the possibilities that e-cigarette use might promote nicotine use among non-smokers, especially children; serve to renormalise smoking; or serve as a gateway to the use of combustible cigarettes or illicit drugs.On the bases of the scientific evidence on e-cigarette, this article explore benefits and harms to public health to guide practice, policy, and regulation through reviewing two major reports and special debate articles.A reframing of societal nicotine use through the lens of 'harm reduction' is an extraordinary opportunity to enhance the impact of tobacco control efforts in Korea.",

      "title": "Food Addiction",
      "abstract": "The evidence for food's addictive properties is steadily growing. In addition to clinical and evolutionary plausibility, the possibility of addiction to food is supported by animal model research and increasingly by research with humans. Much as classic drugs of abuse \"hijack\" the brain, accumulating evidence with food suggests a similar impact, but with weaker effects. Although neurobiological evidence for food addiction is compelling, dependence as conceptualized with respect to alcohol and other drugs of abuse is fundamentally a behavioral disorder. Thus, we review the current state of food addiction research in the context of each of the diagnostic criterion for dependence (ie, tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control) and briefly explore other relevant addiction topics such as expectancies, reinforcement, and incentive salience. There is substantial evidence that some people lose control over their food consumption, suffer from repeated failed attempts to reduce their intake, and are unable to abstain from certain types of food or reduce consumption in the face of negative consequences. Although there is some evidence for other dependence criterion, further research is needed to examine tolerance and withdrawal to high-fat sweets, time spent in obtaining, using, and recovering from excess food consumption and the degree to which important activities are given up due to overconsumption. As science continues forward and both the public and elected leaders become aware that food may trigger an addictive process, this information will likely be used to inform policy. Thus, researchers need to carefully consider the implications of their work and the way in which the results may be interpreted.",

Although repeated exposure to alcohol is thought to explain tolerance development on a physiological level, the acquisition of behavioral tolerance appears to involve additional factors. In particular, learned associations between a drinker's behavior following alcohol consumption and the subsequent consequences may play an important role. When favorable consequences result from displaying unimpaired (i.e., tolerant) behavior after drinking, a drinker learns to develop behavioral strategies to compensate for alcohol's effects. In contrast, if a drinker does not receive a reward for unimpaired behavior--or finds that a more favorable outcome follows the display of intoxicated behavior--tolerance does not develop. Studies show that subjects also can develop behavioral tolerance to alcohol when they practice a task while impaired by factors other than alcohol or when they mentally rehearse task performance while under the influence of alcohol.",

To drink legally in the United States persons must be at least 21 years old, whereas in many other countries the age limit is 18 or 19 years. Underage drinking is a serious public problem in some countries given the implications for the drinkers' health, lowered inhibitions and conduct (such as traffic accidents), and the possibility of some persons developing active alcoholism. Trends in underage drinking vary by family socialization, socioeconomic status, race, gender, and onset of alcohol consumption. This has led to policies to reduce related harms.",

They contain high levels of caffeine and other additives that act as stimulants. Several recent studies present that energy drinks could increase the risk of seizures, acid-base disorders and cardiovascular events. The authors report a 28-year-old man who was brought to the emergency room after sudden onset of tonic-clonic seizures and metabolic acidosis after drinking several cans of a caffeinated energy drink. The authors believe that this clinical picture was caused by caffeine intoxication from an energetic drink causing a syndrome of catecholamine excess. The patient was discharged within a week with no complaints and no neurological signs. Finally, recognising the features of caffeine intoxication and its potential health consequences may be especially relevant when treating younger persons who may be more likely to consume energy drinks.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Imitation/non‐imitation by adult offspring of alcohol‐related parent behavior was examined in the context of the fall‐off effect’ and of sensible/problem alcohol use, two processes which tend to constrain drinking. Evidence indicates there is more imitation by adult offspring of abstemious parents (both abstainer and low volume) than of high volume parents. Adult offspring drink significantly less, on the average, than their high volume parents, a phenomenon here termed‘fall‐off effect’ for both men and women with respect to either their fathers or mothers. This fall‐off among social drinkers appears when the mother approaches or the father consumes at or more than a typical daily drinking level (≥1 drink per day). More sensible drinking occurs among adult offspring when (I) the parent has no drinking problem‐signs than when the parent has drinking problems (this pattern appears at all levels of offspring consumption), and (2) when parents drink at high volume and have no problems for those offspring who do not imitate parent volume. Drinking “sensibly’ appears to be associated directly with the level of parent alcohol use and offsprings’ own drinking levels (considered as imitation or non‐imitation of parents), and indirectly with offspring recall of problematic intake by parents. Drinking sensibly is a medical, education and public health issue.",

      "abstract": "Position Statement: The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) bases the following position stand on a critical analysis of the literature on the safety and efficacy of the use of energy drinks (ED) or energy shots (ES). The ISSN has concluded the following. 1. Although ED and ES contain a number of nutrients that are purported to affect mental and/or physical performance, the primary ergogenic nutrients in most ED and ES appear to be carbohydrate and/or caffeine. 2. The ergogenic value of caffeine on mental and physical performance has been well-established but the potential additive benefits of other nutrients contained in ED and ES remains to be determined. 3. Consuming ED 10-60 minutes before exercise can improve mental focus, alertness, anaerobic performance, and/or endurance performance. 4. Many ED and ES contain numerous ingredients; these products in particular merit further study to demonstrate their safety and potential effects on physical and mental performance. 5. There is some limited evidence that consumption of low-calorie ED during training and/or weight loss trials may provide ergogenic benefit and/or promote a small amount of additional fat loss. However, ingestion of higher calorie ED may promote weight gain if the energy intake from consumption of ED is not carefully considered as part of the total daily energy intake. 6. Athletes should consider the impact of ingesting high glycemic load carbohydrates on metabolic health, blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as the effects of caffeine and other stimulants on motor skill performance. 7. Children and adolescents should only consider use of ED or ES with parental approval after consideration of the amount of carbohydrate, caffeine, and other nutrients contained in the ED or ES and a thorough understanding of the potential side effects. 8. Indiscriminant use of ED or ES, especially if more than one serving per day is consumed, may lead to adverse events and harmful side effects. 9. Diabetics and individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatorenal, and neurologic disease who are taking medications that may be affected by high glycemic load foods, caffeine, and/or other stimulants should avoid use of ED and/or ES unless approved by their physician.",

      "abstract": "Looking for opportunities to squeeze more physical activity into your busy lifestyle? The second edition of The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that regular physical activity is one of the most important things that we can do to improve our health, prevent chronic disease, improve brain health, improve sleep quality, and reduce the risk of anxiety and depression. Let’s look at the guidelines and some practical ways you can apply them to your life. ✓ Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Any physical activity can aid in offsetting the risks of chronic disease. Replacing sitting with anything active is likely to produce some health benefits. - Intentionally store regularly used household items out of the way. Snacks, for example, can be stored downstairs, paper towels are a walk to the garage. - Not having ice cream in the house means that if you want it, you have to make a trip to go out and enjoy that single serving. - Try an activity tracker. Most smart phones offer some form of tracking (steps or movement). Being conscious of how much you move or do not move is the first step in achieving progress. - Walk or use mass transit instead of driving. You will be surprised how much activity you gain and how much money you will save. - Head to a mall or grab a cart and go food shopping instead of ordering online. ✓ Any activity counts. Physical activity means just that — move your body. - Focus on what you do. Often we focus on what we do not do and that leads to negative thought cycles. Start with a plan of how you will add movement into each day. - Replace sitting with standing when possible. - If you cannot stand, move while you sit. You can march while seated, for example. - Make a virtual activity call with a friend. Decide on a time to chat while you both walk. - Listen to audio books or podcasts while you walk, ride a stationary bike, or do chores. - Choose the stairs. Make this a pact with loved ones or colleagues. ✓ Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefit. Surprise yourself with what you can accomplish in 30 seconds. - Try a standing desk. - Take your colleague for a walk to brainstorm instead of sitting in a conference room. - Be a movement champion — make standing and moving during meetings a workplace mission. Adding in simple, short duration movements to your day will count toward your activity goal, for example, push-ups against a wall or kitchen counter, squatting to a chair and standing up, and knee lifts between phone calls. ✓ For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. Intensity is relative to each individual. Generally, if you can carry on a conversation during activity, it is considered moderate; if you need to catch your breath between sentences, it is more vigorous; if you can only gasp a few breathy words, it is very intense. - The easiest way to conquer this recommendation is to choose activities you enjoy and make them a part of your weekly schedule. - Social support is a key ingredient to movement success. Engage a friend or loved one in your activities. Make activity dates. Many activity trackers offer challenges you can do with friends. - Try a new activity — golf, swimming, dancing, yoga, bird watching, or aquatic exercise. - Make it a family activity. A brisk walk before or after dinner or a game of hide and seek with little ones can add up to a fun habit. - Binge-watching TV? Put a stationary bike, personal rebounder (mini-trampoline), rower, treadmill, or other equipment in front of your screen. You also can march in place while watching your favorite shows. ✓ Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week. - A scheduled 45-minute walk each day plus extra opportunities to move and you can meet this easily. - Realize those times when you are doing more activity and try and replicate it. ✓ Adults also should do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits. Adding in strength activities adds so much value to how you feel and how well you function each day. Lifting your kids, pets, groceries, or aiding loved ones is a major part of life, and having the ability to continue to perform those functions builds confidence and independence and will count toward your weekly movement goals. - Use your big box shopping time to practice some heavy lifting. For example, a carton of 24 (16.9 oz) water bottles weighs about 28 lbs. Carry those around the store or around your house and you will quickly realize how important strength is. - Having a strength program prescribed by an ACSM certified personal trainer is ideal. Meet with the trainer regularly for motivation and form checks or intermittently for program updates. - Join a community center or gym and learn a quick circuit of exercises you can do in 30 minutes. - Try resistance bands at home to add weight/load to exercises. - The basics are still great. Push-ups, squats, lunges, planks, and triceps dips are great examples of body weight exercises that build strength. - If you ever tried to pull a stubborn weed or move a shrub, you understand that heavy gardening builds strength. Every moving minute counts toward making deposits in your activity account. Get moving for life.Sidebar: Stay Active on Vacation On a cruise? Never take the elevator. Visiting a new city? Take a walking tour. Communing with the outdoors? Try trail walking. Sports buff? Try a golf vacation, ski vacation, or learning to surf or paddle board. Zoos, water parks, and similar attractions require lots of movement — and make a lot of great memories.",

Research suggests that women experience addiction telescoping when they abuse alcohol, tobacco, specific stimulants, and possibly opioids. Medical side effects also develop more rapidly in women than men when they abuse many substances. Cancer and cardiac complications, specifically, pose a significant threat for women who abuse almost all types of substances. However, the physical consequences are not the only ones women suffer when they engage in substance abuse. Research on substance abuse in women ties opioids to mood and anxiety disorders, heroin to neurological deficiencies, cocaine to immune system suppression, and alcohol to intimate partner abuse. Additionally, female substance abusers, on average, have a lower level of education and lower rates of employment. In light of these gender-specific concerns, physicians should give particular consideration to detecting substance abuse in women.",

The aim of this review was to look more closely at the nutritional problems that are specific of smokers, which may harm their health. Methods: a bibliographic search related to the topic. Results: smokers consume lower amounts of various foods, especially fruits, vegetables, cereals and dairy. As a result, their intake of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals is lower than that observed in non-smokers. Their consumption of meat, caffeine and alcohol is usually higher, and their activity lower than those of non-smokers, coexisting in smokers unhealthy behaviors that contribute to harming their health and quality of life. Oxidative stress and metabolic changes render the needs for some nutrients higher in smokers to achieve the same biochemical situation as in non-smokers. Recommended intakes of vitamin C have increased, but it will probably be necessary to also increase the intakes of other nutrients. In general, smokers suffer from deficiencies more frequently (vitamins C, E, β-carotene, B1, B2, B12, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, iron, iodine, etc.) than non-smokers. Passive smokers are also affected in their eating habits and nutritional status. Conclusions: the worse nutritional status of smokers can contribute to the appearance/worsening of various diseases associated with smoking (cardiovascular, cancer, cataracts, osteoporosis, etc.); therefore, nutritional surveillance and correction of nutritional deficiencies could represents health benefits for smokers and passive smokers, which should be considered in the future.Objetivos: el consumo de tabaco, activo o pasivo, afecta a un elevado porcentaje de individuos y se asocia a diversos riesgos sanitarios. Profundizar en los problemas nutricionales específicos de los fumadores que pueden contribuir a perjudicar su salud constituye el objeto de la presente revisión. Métodos: búsqueda bibliográfica en relación con el tema. Resultados: los fumadores consumen cantidades inferiores de diversos alimentos, especialmente: frutas, verduras, cereales y lácteos. Como consecuencia, su ingesta de vitaminas, minerales y fitoquímicos es inferior a la observada en los no fumadores. Su consumo de carne, cafeína y alcohol suele ser superior y su actividad inferior a la de los no fumadores, coexistiendo en los fumadores conductas poco saludables que se potencian, perjudicando la salud y la calidad de vida del colectivo. El estrés oxidativo y los cambios metabólicos hacen que las necesidades de algunos nutrientes sean superiores en los fumadores para lograr la misma situación bioquímica que en los no fumadores. Las ingestas recomendadas de vitamina C se han incrementado, pero probablemente sea necesario aumentar las de otros nutrientes. En general, los fumadores sufren deficiencias con más frecuencia (vitaminas C, E, β-caroteno, B1, B2, B12, ácido fólico, calcio, magnesio, hierro, yodo, etc.) que los no fumadores. Los fumadores pasivos se ven afectados también en sus hábitos alimentarios y su situación nutricional. Conclusiones: la peor situación nutricional de los fumadores puede contribuir a la aparición/el empeoramiento de diversas patologías asociadas al hábito de fumar (cardiovasculares, cáncer, cataratas, osteoporosis, etc.), por lo que la vigilancia nutricional y la corrección de las deficiencias nutricionales podrían suponer un beneficio sanitario para los fumadores y fumadores pasivos que debe ser considerada en el futuro.",

      "abstract": "E-cigarette use among adolescents is a growing public health concern, driven by discreet designs, appealing flavors, and social influences. Despite high addiction rates, most teen users express a desire to quit, though evidence-based cessation tools remain limited. Behavioral interventions, including tech-based programs like This Is Quitting and smokeSCREEN, show promise. Pharmacotherapy, particularly varenicline, may support quitting, though its role in adolescents is still under investigation. Pediatricians must address this issue through empathetic, multifaceted approaches that combine education, behavioral support, and emerging treatments to curb early nicotine dependence and its long-term health consequences.",

      "title": "Cannabis vaping: Understanding the health risks of a rapidly emerging trend",
      "abstract": "Abstract The rapid emergence of youth vaping has completely changed the landscape of adolescent substance use in Canada and has become a pressing public health issue of our time. While nicotine remains the most common substance encountered in vaping devices, cannabis vaping is now reported by one-third of youth who vape. Though cannabis vaping is thought to generate fewer toxic emissions than cannabis smoking, it has been associated with several cases of acute lung injury and often involves high-potency forms of cannabis, exposing youth to several acute and long-term health risks. The low perceived riskiness of cannabis as a substance and of vaping as a mode of consumption may bring a false sense of security and be particularly appealing for youth who may be looking for a ‘healthier way’ to use substances. While research is still lacking on how best to support youth who may have already initiated cannabis vaping, concerted efforts among paediatric providers, public health experts, schools, communities, and families are urgently needed to limit the spread of cannabis vaping among Canadian youth.",

Literature pertaining to the prevalence, clinical significance and toxicity of this practice is reviewed, using illustrative cases from a series of 48 NBA consumers. It was found that 10-15% of alcoholics hospitalized in detoxication units have consumed NBA; half of these patients are regular consumers. Addiction to NBA itself may occur. Its use is primarily related to easy accessibility, rather than social or monetary factors. Polydrug misuse and antisocial personality disorder are more frequent in NBA users, but use is not pathognomic of end-stage alcoholism. The 48 NBA users reported surprisingly few toxic symptoms from acute ingestion, perhaps because tolerance to some substances in NBA may occur.

      "abstract": "Canada has witnessed a general decrease in smoking prevalence among all age groups in recent years. However, despite large numbers of campaigns and interventions, thousands of young Canadians continue to initiate cigarette smoking every year. The increasing popularity of alternative tobacco products and e-cigarettes is also creating new health challenges. Research has shown that the deleterious effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke are significant and long lasting. Health care professionals have key responsibilities in preventing tobacco use among youth and their families, and need to know more about effective smoking prevention and cessation strategies. Clinicians need to integrate tobacco counselling into health assessments of teenagers and be aware of the roles that families, communities and governments can play in promoting tobacco-free environments. Information, effective strategies and opportunities for health care professionals to intervene and advocate for Canadian adolescents are discussed. Ces dernières années, le Canada a connu une diminution générale de la prévalence de tabagisme dans tous les groupes d’âge. Cependant, malgré les multiples campagnes et interventions, des milliers de jeunes Canadiens commencent encore à fumer chaque année. La popularité croissante d’autres produits du tabac et de la cigarette électronique (vapoteuse) engendre d’ailleurs de nouveaux enjeux en matière de santé. D’après les recherches, les effets délétères de la nicotine et de la fumée du tabac sont prononcés et persistants. Les professionnels de la santé ont un rôle essentiel à jouer pour prévenir le tabagisme chez les enfants, les adolescents et leur famille, et ils doivent mieux connaître les stratégies efficaces de prévention du tabagisme et d’abandon du tabac. Les cliniciens doivent intégrer les conseils sur le tabagisme à leur évaluation de santé des jeunes et être conscients du rôle des familles, des communautés et des gouvernements dans la promotion de milieux sans tabac. L’information que les professionnels de la santé doivent connaître, les stratégies efficaces qu’ils peuvent utiliser et les occasions d’intervenir et de défendre les intérêts des adolescents canadiens qu’ils peuvent saisir sont présentées.",

De hecho, casi todas las culturas disponen de una droga que acompaña sus rituales sociales, religiosos, o ambos. El ejemplo más cercano se nos presenta en la transformación del vino en la liturgia católica.El consumo de drogas viene condicionado por la interación individuo/ambiente, con toda su complicidad cultural, educativa, consumista, etc. Su prevención es, por tanto, de enorme complejidad y supone una confluencia de esfuerzos entre las diferentes estructuras sociales, que van desde procedimientos legales hasta programas educativos, campañas de consumo, marketing, reestructuración de la economía, educación sanitaria y procedimientos individuales de tratamiento y rehabilitación.Este trabajo hace especial hincapié en los procedimientos psicológicos que deberían formar parte o tomarse en consideración en los programas educativos y de rehabilitación dirigidos a la labor preventiva.ABSTRACTProbably, human drug consumption is as old as humanity. In fact, almost all cultures dispose of some drug to accompany their social and/or religious rites, the closest example we have is the transformation of wine in the Catholic Liturgy. Drugs consumption is conditioned by the individual's interaction with the environment, in all its educational, cultural and consumer complexity. So, its prevention is enormously complex and supposes a confluence of forces between different social structures, that include legal proceedings to educational programs, consumer campaigns, marketing, economy restructuration, health education and treatment and rehabilitation individual programs. This paper enphasizes the psychological steps that must be a part of those educational and rehabilitation programs directed towards a preventive labor.PALABRAS CLAVE: Psicología ambientalconsumo de drogasabuso de drogasdependenciaprevencióncontrol contigencialcomportamiento aditivoaspectos educativosaspectos psicológicosaspectos socialesKEYWORDS: Environmental psychologydrug usedrug abusedependencepreventioncontingent controladitive behavioureducation aspectspsychological aspectssocial aspects",

      "abstract": "One person dies every six seconds from a smoking-related disease and this problem is likely to worsen. While many people try to quit smoking on their own or with using medicinal products, many of them fail. There is an ongoing debate within the public health community about e-cigarettes on whether they have a potential role in smoking cessation, whether their use can reduce harm for individual users, whether the widespread use of these devices has the potential to reduce or increase population-level harm, and how best to regulate e-cigarette use to minimize both individual and population-level harm. Although the long-term effects of e-cigarette use among smokers and non-smokers are not known, nicotine aerosol produced from a solution, rather than from burning tobacco, releases fewer harmful substances than cigarette smoke does. Some experts advocate wider availability and softer regulations regarding e-cigarette use and perceive them as having the potential to help smokers quit or switch to a harm-reducing means of consuming nicotine. Based on scientific evidence on e-cigarettes, this article explores its pros and cons to public health in order to guide practice, policy, and regulation through reviews of debate articles. 'Quit or die' is no longer the only option for those who cannot quit. Safer nicotine products offer another way. There is substantial international and independent evidence that these products are safer than cigarettes.",

The public at large needs to be more informed of the presence of caffeine in commonly consumed foods and beverages, particularly by infants, children and pregnant women. It is the responsibility of all consumers to investigate the caffeine content of suspected products so that intake may be objectively monitored. Although doubts still exist about the efficacy of caffeine as an ergogenic aid, particularly for exercise of high intensity and short duration, the IOC and the National Collegiate Athletic Association of the US have adopted bans on the use of caffeine to aid sport performance. Currently, both of these organizations prohibit the concentration of caffeine in urine to exceed 15 micrograms-ml-1. That is to say, only very large amounts of caffeine are not permitted at present. Additional research is needed to confirm or deny the contraindications presented by the ingestion of caffeine on a chronic basis.",

      "title": "Can the use of varenicline improve the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for nicotine addiction?",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Smoking is a huge medical and social problem in Poland, with as many as about 24% of Poles being addicted to nicotine. Approximately 6 million people worldwide die every year from conditions that are closely related to tobacco addiction, such as cancer and cardiovascular, metabolic or lung diseases. The difficulty in combatting nicotine dependence is largely due to the complex mechanism of this addiction. The motivation of a patient to quit smoking is of great importance in the difficult withdrawal process. Strengthening this motivation is one of the most important tasks of physicians and addiction therapists. Overview of literature: Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been the most widely known way to break away from smoking addiction for many years now. It involves delivering nicotine to the body in ways that are less harmful than through tobacco smoke. As a consequence, the cravings for nicotine are reduced, making it easier for the patient to break with the addiction. Clinical trials have shown that the use of NRT is associated with a 50-70% increased chance of maintaining abstinence from smoking compared to placebo. There are many NRT products, including nicotine chewing gum, nicotine patches, lozenges, dissolvable nicotine sticks, or inhalers. Bupropion is a selective dopamine–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. This drug is one of the most commonly used in the pharmacotherapy of depression in the United States. At the same time, it has been found to have a positive effect on people trying to break up with the habit of smoking cigarettes. The mechanism of action remains unknown in this case, but studies clearly indicate the efficacy of bupropion, which is comparable to the efficacy of NRT. Varenicline is a partial agonist selective for α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It has a higher affinity for these receptors than nicotine. By stimulating them, it causes an increase in dopamine secretion (but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoking), helping in this way ease withdrawal symptoms. Conclusions: Varenicline has higher efficacy than bupropion and NRTs. Simultaneous use of two NRT forms increases the effectiveness of this method to a level comparable to varenicline. Contrary to previous reports, it seems that varenicline does not increase self-aggressive behaviour and the risk of suicide. The effectiveness of antinicotinic drugs depends on the sex of the patient. For both sexes, the most effective drug is varenicline. It is slightly more effective in women than in men. By contrast, NRT and bupropion show greater therapeutic potential in men. Keywords: smoking cessation, nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, bupropion, cytisine",

It impacts all aspects of a person's life; mental, physical, emotional, and social. Drug addiction is responsible for more deaths, illnesses, and disabilities than any other avoidable health problem. In the last century, most people decrease their use of smoking tobacco, and alcohol abuse but there are significantly elevated rates of using drugs. In some countries, they found that the use of the drug is more in males, and in other countries found more in females than males, it differs from one culture to other probably depend on many factors. Adolescents there are curious to deviate in ways even the competent of them and increase overtime with prevalence of newer drugs. They start using it at youth age, and most of them are university students. They think that it improves their life and academic performance, and they are easily influenced by their bad friends. In Sudan nowadays, we notice that drug abuse becomes a national issue because drug dealers and drugs user become at a higher rate than in the past, also the number of deaths from overdose is increasing, so we need more research about it. The Drug Enforcement Administration in every country spends a lot of money to catch drug dealers, stop cannabis delivery, and ended it to save their nation. It affects individual lives and then affects the community which leads to delays in the development of our country. In this Review, we discuss the effect of drugs on the most important aspects of adolescents' life.",

      "abstract": "FigureFigureIt works! It doesn't work. It treats vomiting! It causes severe vomiting. It helps my grandma's arthritis! It doesn't do anything for my grandpa's arthritis. How confusing this is for everyone when a fix-all medicine is all over the place and seemingly unpredictable. We medical scientists rely on consistent dosing and outcomes, but we feel overwhelmed and flabbergasted when it comes to the plant Cannabis and all of the progress that has been made. I hope this simple guide will help you create an everyday language. Let's start with a dialogue that is common with recreational and medical patients. Recreational Patients Doctor: Do you use any illegal or legal drugs that are not prescribed to you? Patient: I smoke pot. Doctor: Do you smoke or vape flower or oil? Patient: Whoa! No one has ever asked me that before. Sometimes I smoke flower; sometimes I vape oil. Guess it depends. Doctor: Which do you use the most? And how often do you smoke? Patient: I usually take one or two hits of flower off a bong at night to help me sleep. It started after my dad died last year. Case Review This patient is smoking plant for sleep, which means THC is the dominant chemical, and his mode of use is inhalation. The dosage is unclear, but one or two inhalations are low dose. He initially presented as a recreational user, but he is most likely using it to treat grief from his father's death. Could this be a treatment strategy for anxiety and depression as well? That's unclear, but he will likely benefit from grief counseling and referral. Another Recreational Patient Doctor: Do you use any illegal or legal drugs that are not prescribed to you? Patient: Yes, I took an edible a couple of hours ago. Then when it wasn't working, I took another one. Now I feel terrible. I think I might die. Doctor: Do you have a picture of what you took? Patient: Yes, I ordered it online. Doctor: I see. Based on the label, this is probably a 5 mg THC-only gummy. So, you took two of these, which is a total of 10 mg THC. Do you use Cannabis or marijuana products regularly? Patient: No, but I'm in town with friends, and it's legal here, so we wanted to try it. Doctor: You are going to feel pretty miserable for anywhere from six to 24 hours, including feeling sleepy or nauseated, and you might have some vomiting. But it will pass. Please go sleep it off somewhere you feel safe. Moving forward, Cannabis edibles take about an hour or two to take effect, and 2.5 mg to 5 mg is considered a substantial dose for a novice in recreational use. Whatever you do, do not take a second dose for four to six hours. That can make you feel pretty crummy. Case Review This is a common presentation of THC misuse for recreational purposes. The patient used THC 5 mg, ingested orally. He is having an unintentional mild THC overdose that will self-resolve. You can treat symptomatically in the ED or send the patient home if he can be safely cared for there. The typical treatment of choice is one to two doses of Ativan and perhaps Zofran. Medical Patient Doctor: Your daughter with a known history of epilepsy had a seizure; this can happen occasionally. Usually it is caused by infection, lack of sleep, stress, or inconsistently taking seizure medications. What seizure medications is she currently taking, and have they been skipped recently? Patient: I have been giving her CBD only at this time. Usually, we give 10 mg three times per day. The doctor wrote out the dose for her weight. Doctor: I see. Has she been taking it routinely? How much does she take and how often? Have there been any missed doses? Or a change in brands or products or anything else you can think of? Patient: Yes, it was getting really expensive, and we couldn't afford it anymore. We have been skipping doses recently. She was doing so well, and I didn't really think it was a big deal. Doctor: I understand. All her tests have come back normal, so there is no sign of infection. I suspect she had a breakthrough seizure because she has not been taking her dose of CBD. Please follow up with your neurologist or Cannabis specialist for further instruction on CBD dosing. She may also be a candidate for a second antiepileptic because of the seizure today. Case Review This child has been taking CBD 10 mg TID, weight-based dosing, ingested orally. But she has been noncompliant because of financial constraints. You can offer to restart the patient's CBD or provide pharmaceutical options covered by their insurance. This is a true medical patient. CBD has been shown to have antiseizure effects and is now utilized for this. When physicians roll their eyes about this treatment, they are showing their own shortcomings and lack of education, not the patient's. CBD has been shown to be effective for Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome for seizure control at 5-10 mg/kg orally two to three times a day. A patient using dosages more or less than this may see different results and side effects. (J Korean Med Sci. 2020;35[50]:e427.) What We Know You need to ask precisely what the patient is taking to get a better understanding of what is being used and its side effects and overdose effects. That includes the chemical name, dose, route of intake, and frequency. The most common challenges I see with patients and physicians are frustration in thinking that all Cannabis is the same, not recognizing individual parts of the plant, dosage confusion, and not understanding which symptoms and diagnosis to treat.

      "abstract": "Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death, responsible for over 400,000 premature deaths every year in the United States and weighing heavily on an economy with a nearly $200 billion combined cost of health care and lost productivity (1). Despite the deleterious immediate and long-term effects of smoking, only 3% of smokers successfully quit, although 70% of all smokers express the desire to do so (2). Nicotine is the main addictive psychoactive ingredient present in tobacco smoke (3). Chronic exposure to nicotine initiates neuroadaptation; these alterations, in turn, promote continued tobacco use. When a smoker attempts cessation, this new equilibrium maintained by nicotine exposure is disrupted, leading to the withdrawal state. Withdrawal is a series of affective and somatic symptoms that emerge a few hours after nicotine abstinence, reflecting neurochemical imbalance (4); however, the precise nature of this imbalance has remained elusive. Nicotine, as is the case with many other drugs of abuse, is known to have an impact on the dopamine (DA) system (5). Grieder et al. (6) perform a series of elegant experiments using pharmacology and electrophysiology in parallel with genetic and behavioral approaches to examine how the dopaminergic system may be involved in this process. An important aspect of their work is that it highlights the double dissociation of dopaminergic system involvement between acute exposure to nicotine and the chronic withdrawn state with respect to DA neuron activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the DA receptors that mediate conditioned place aversion (Fig. 1).",

It is not addictive, nor does it cause the aggressive behavior alcohol does. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the use of marihuana need necessarily lead to the use of LSD or any of the hard drugs.

      "abstract": "Substance abuse is also known as drug abuse. It is a rapidly growing menace in India and so in the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. This problem places a huge burden on society as it generates loopholes in the physical, mental, familial, financial, legal and social fabrics of our life in the community. The common terms that are used to identify these maladaptive behaviors are drug addicts, substance user, alcoholic or more community based terms like baivda, charsi, drunkard, etc. These problems of substance abuse like alcohol, tobacco, opioids, cannabis etc. need to be stopped and ways are to identified to keep the younger generation away from this new and growing problem of drug addiction. Statistics have proved that youth in Kashmir are inclined to substances and are slowly and steadily going in the lap of substance use disorders",

Population-based studies reviewed in this article suggest that tea drinking has beneficial effects on cognitive function of elderly persons. However, a cause-effect relationship between tea consumption and cognitive decline and dementia could not be drawn given inconsistent findings from only two longitudinal cohort studies. The neuroprotective effects of tea consumption could be due to catechins, L-theanine and other compounds in tea leaves. More longitudinal observational study is needed. Information on life-time tea consumption and blood concentrations of catechins and L-theanine could be collected in future studies.",

      "abstract": "An energy drink is a type of  beverage  containing stimulant drugs, chiefly  caffeine , which is marketed as providing mental and physical stimulation. They may or may not be  carbonated  and many also contain sugar or other sweeteners,  herbal extracts  and  amino acids . First commercial energy drink was introduced in Europe in 1987 and the sale of these drinks increased rapidly throughout the world. These drinks are based on caffeine which acts through inhibition and activation of various receptors, and thus affects almost all the body systems. There is an increasing body of evidence about the medical hazards of uncontrolled use of these drinks , with neurologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular and metabolic complications. (1) Mostly the energy drink contains taurine, caffeine, herbal extracts and carbohydrates. These drinks contain caffeine about 80 to 141 mg per cent. (2) Dangers of taking too many energy drinks at one time includes cardiac arrest, headache and migraine, insomnia, addiction to caffeine, nervousness, risky behavior and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Specific effects that have been reported by energy drinks include jitteriness, dizziness, the inability to focus, difficulty concentrating, gastrointestinal upset, and insomnia. Health care providers report that they have also seen the following effects from the consumption of energy drinks: dehydration, accelerated heart rates, anxiety, seizures, acute mania, and strokes. (3) International health organizations have warned the public against consuming such drinks particularly young people under the age of 16, pregnant women and those with cardiac problems and diabetes. (4) Saudi Arabia recently banned the sale of energy drinks at government, health and education facilities and outlawed all forms of advertising for the drinks, including the sponsorship of any sporting, social or cultural events by energy drinks companies. The Cabinet meeting of Saudi Arabia approved number of actions according to the Saudi Press Agency, these includes:  1 - To prohibit advertising of any energy drinks or do advertising or promotional campaigns for any energy drink via any readable, audible or visible media or by any other means.”  2 - To prohibit energy drinks companies, their agents, distributors and marketing associations from sponsoring any sporting, social or cultural event, or taking any procedure leading to promotion.  3 - To prohibit the free distribution of energy drinks to consumers of all age groups.  4 - To prohibit the sale of energy drinks in restaurants and canteens in government facilities; education and health facilities; halls and public and private sports clubs.  5 – Decision has been taken, factory owners and importers of energy drinks shall be committing to writing a text on the tin of any energy drink in Arabic and English languages - warning of the harmful effects of energy drinks.

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are devices that allow the user to inhale nicotine in a vapor, and are primarily marketed as a means of quitting smoking and a less harmful replacement for traditional cigarette smoking. However, further research is needed to determine if vaping nicotine via e-cigarettes can be effective. Conversely, nicotine has been considered a gateway drug to alcohol and other addictive drugs and e-cigarettes containing nicotine may have the same effects. Previous reports have shown that e-cigarette use may open the gate for the use of other drugs including conventional cigarettes, cannabis, opioids, etc. The increasing prevalence of e-cigarettes, particularly among youth and adolescents in the last decade have led to an increase in the dual use of e-cigarettes with alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit drug use like heroin and 3-4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). The advent of e-cigarettes as a device to self-administer addictive agents such as cocaine and synthetic cathinones may bring about additional adverse health effects associated with their concurrent use. This review aims to briefly describe e-cigarettes and their different generations, and their co-use with other addictive drugs as well as the use of the device as a tool to self-administer addictive drugs, such as cocaine, etc.",

      "abstract": "Consumption of alcohol mixed with caffeinated energy drinks is becoming popular, and the number of pre-mixed caffeinated alcohol products on the worldwide market is increasing. There is public health concern and even occasional legal restriction relating to these drinks, due to associations with increased intoxication and harms. The precise nature and degree of the pharmacological relationship between caffeine and alcohol is not yet elucidated, but it is proposed that caffeine attenuates the sedative effects of alcohol intoxication while leaving motor and cognitive impairment unaffected. This creates a potentially precarious scenario for users who may underestimate their level of intoxication and impairment. While legislation in some countries has restricted production or marketing of pre-mixed products, many individuals mix their own energy drink-alcohol 'cocktails'. Wider dissemination of the risks might help balance marketing strategies that over-emphasize putative positive effects.",

In addition to the obviously anticipated clarification of normal values relating to erectile function and anatomy and refinement of examinations, tests, and procedures, there is still much to be discovered, refined, and defined. We can anticipate new medications being found to enhance penile erections. Maybe a pacemaker will be possible that will stimulate an erection. New methods will be developed to insert coils and scarring agents for veno-occlusive disorders. Drugs will be produced in the form of pills, creams, or injectables that will dilate, clean out, or prevent blockage in the arteries. Preventing erectile dysfunction should become the issue in the 1990s and the next century. Changes in life-style such as reducing stress, eating healthier, stopping smoking, exercising more, and reducing alcohol consumption will lead to better bodily functioning. Essentially, taking responsibility for our own well being will become important. Health promotion, instead of curing, will receive greater focus. Education will play an important part in realizing a goal of mature sexuality and improved general well-being.",

Major interest has been on nicotine, as well as on toxic and carcinogenic effects and several major and minor components of tobacco smoke responsible for the negative health effects of smoking have been elucidated. Smokers themselves report a variety of positive effects from smoking, including effects on depression, anxiety and mental acuity. Smoking has also been shown to have protective effects in Parkinson’s Disease. Are the subjective reports of a positive effect of smoking due to nicotine, of some other components of tobacco smoke, or are they a manifestation of the relief from nicotine withdrawal symptoms that smoking provides?

      "abstract": "Drugs are surrounded by an aura of myths. They are associated with various cults, ideologies, social movements and – unfortunately – pathologies. Humanity has been familiar with psychoactive substances for time immemorial but the functions of these substances have changed over the years. This change has been increasingly dynamic of late. Within the last few decades not only has the model of drug taking changed but also young people’s attitudes towards the substances. Most noteworthy is the evolution that has taken place in the model of drug taking. Nowadays the practice is not limited, as it used to be, to narrow circles of recognisably pathological youngsters but has spread to pupils, students and young men and women who have completed their education and joined the work force, who treat some of the substances as a no less popular element of their daily lives than alcohol. This state of affairs has been brought about to a considerable extent by the changes which are taking place on the drug market itself and by the quantum change in attitudes towards psychoactive substances. The model of functioning of people who take drugs has also changed. Previously, drugs were not taken on an occasional basis but were part of a permanent drug culture. Those who took drugs formed tight-knitted communities. Now, however, young people often take drugs spontaneously, occasionally, almost on the spur of the moment, without being associated with any specific social margin. Youngsters’ enormous receptivity to soft drugs and the constant presence of marihuana in their cultural activities has “habituated” them to the problems of drug dependence and led them to feel that they can take drugs and still belong to the drug-free community.",

Die geeignetste Zielgruppe fuer einen Kurs zur Wiederherstellung der Eignung sind die (ehemals) gelegentlichen Konsumenten von Cannabis mit Trennungsproblematik, regelmaessige Cannabiskonsumenten oder unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen Konsumenten anderer Partydrogen wie XTC, Speed oder Kokain. Eine Wiederherstellung der Eignung im Bereich der BtM-Konsumenten ist stets mit dem Ziel einer stabilen Drogenabstinenz zu verbinden, andere Kursziele waeren nicht konform unter anderem mit den Begutachtungs-Leitlinien.

      "abstract": "Caffeine is widely consumed by people of all ages. In the last period a market of caffeine-containing products, particularly energy drinks and food supplements increased. Caffeine for years is under discussion, whether has positive whether adverse impact on health. Children are a group of special anxieties. Caffeine is a stimulant of central nervous system and therefore is probably the most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world. The physiological effect of caffeine and the lack of nutrition value causes a great interest its impact on health, especially with reference to the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Results of scientific research are not clear. The influence of caffeine on the human body is conditioned with the individual metabolism of caffeine which also depends on many endogenic and environmental factors. According to the current knowledge moderate caffeine intake by healthy adults at a dose level of 400 mg a day is not associated with adverse effects, but it also depends on other health determinants of a lifestyle. Excessive caffeine consumption can cause negative health consequences such as psychomotor agitation, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal complaints. Adverse effect of caffeine intoxication is classified in World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Metabolism of caffeine by pregnant woman is slowed down. Caffeine and its metabolites pass freely across the placenta into a fetus. For this reason pregnant women should limit caffeine intake. Children and adolescents should also limit daily caffeine consumption. It results from the influence of caffeine on the central nervous system in the period of rapid growth and the final stage of brain development, calcium balance and sleep duration. Average daily caffeine consumption in European countries ranging from 280-490 mg. The highest caffeine intake is in Scandinavian countries what results from the great consumption of the coffee. As far as caffeine consumption by Polish population is concerned there is very few data in this subject so far. In the nineties of the previous century it was 141 mg per day, whereas according to recent survey daily caffeine intake by women from the Warsaw region was 251 mg and 15% of examined women consumed an excessive quantity of caffeine (> or = 400 mg). Smokers consume more caffeine than nonsmokers, similarly to persons with mental illnesses. With reference to the caffeine consumption it should be underline that caffeine content in coffee and tea beverages varies greatly depending on the method of brewing whereas the content of caffeine in many brands of energy drinks can much vary. This should be taken into account in the daily caffeine intake.",

Its actions on the central nervous system, however, result in decrements in skill and behavioural changes that may have adverse effects on performance. There is also evidence of dose-dependent decrements in aerobic capacity. Although the mechanisms are not well understood, the aftermath of alcohol use (hangover) may also adversely affect performance for many hours after intoxication. Alcohol intoxication may adversely affect the player's dietary choices by displacing carbohydrate from the diet at a time when restoration of glycogen stores should be a priority.",

      "abstract": "Cuando se desea examinar y evaluar las politicas de drogas, es util distinguir entre problemas de drogas primarios y secundarios (L. Hulsman y H. Van Ransbeek, 1983). Problemas de drogas primarios son los relacionados con las drogas que se producen con independencia de la politica de drogas que se siga en el sector colectivo; problemas de drogas secundarios son aquellos que estan relacionados especificamente con una determinada politica de drogas y que no ocurririan de esta manera si se adoptara una politica de drogas diferente. Tomemos algunos ejemplos de problemas primarios en materia de drogas. Un consumidor de drogas puede sufrir danos en su salud fisica: cirrosis, como consecuencia del alcohol, o una enfermedad pulmonar, como consecuencia de fumar cigarrillos regularmente. El dano puede tambien referirse a su salud mental: algunas sicosis se manifiestan despues del consumo de alcohol o de LSD. La dependencia fisica o sicologica puede convertirse en una carga. El consumo de droga puede convertirse en el punto central de la vida, impidiendo el desarrollo personal. Todos estos problemas que afectan al consumidor de drogas, afectan tambien a menudo a su medio inmediato: su familia, sus amigos y sus colegas en el lugar de trabajo. El consumo de drogas puede tambien presentar problemas primarios para un mas amplio medio circundante del consumidor. Algunas personas son propensas a volverse violentas despues del consumo excesivo de alcohol. La combinacion de consumo de alcohol con la conduccion de vehiculos motorizados presenta riesgos especiales para los otros usuarios de la carretera. Ninguno de estos problemas primarios de las drogas esta especificamente ligado al consumo de heroina, cocaina u otras drogas ilegales. El alcohol, el tabaco y las drogas medicinales pueden producir problemas de esta naturaleza (Plant. 1981). Los problemas secundarios de drogas estan especificamente relacionados con las drogas ilegales. Veamos mas de cerca algunos de estos problemas secundarios de drogas. Quiero hacer una distincion entre: 1) problemas secundarios para el consumidor; 2) problemas secundarios para el medio ambiente del consumidor; 3) problemas secundarios para la justicia criminal; y 4) problemas secundarios para el sistema medico-social.

      "abstract": "The proceedings of the second annual scientific conference of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco are summarized. The goal of the annual conference was to disseminate information about ongoing nicotine research from biological, behavioral and social perspectives. Data were presented describing our current understanding of the structure and function of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, by which nicotine exerts most, if not all, of its effects in the brain. The conformational complexity of receptor subunits expressed in different brain areas contributes significantly to the complexity of responses observed to nicotinic agonists. Nicotine is being developed as a medication that might be used to maintain smoking cessation and to treat various medical diseases. The potential toxicity of nicotine, apart from cigarette smoking, is an important variable in assessing the benefits and risks of such therapeutic applications. The risks of nicotine-containing medications appear to be far less than those associated with tobacco use. Recent data indicate that cigarette smoking is increasing among young in the United States. Adolescent smokers are interested in quitting and make frequent quit attempts, but are usually not successful. Effective methods are needed to manage adolescent smokers before they become heavily addicted. Nicotine replacement as a pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation has made a significant contribution in improving quit rates. New medications have been developed that target specific populations of smokers.",

Debido a su accesibilidad, se tiende a considerar que son sustancias poco lesivas, pero en realidad se asocian a efectos negativos muy importantes sobre la salud de los que los consumen. Diversos factores, como la delincuencia, la personalidad antisocial, el hecho de tener una familia de origen desestructurada, ser “ninos de la calle”, o presentar comorbilidad con otros trastornos mentales se han asociado con el desarrollo de problemas de abuso o dependencia de inhalantes entre los mas jovenes. Se requiere un mayor esfuerzo investigador para aumentar el actual conocimiento sobre el consumo de inhalantes, y para implementar tratamientos que actuen sobre estos trastornos y sus consecuencias biopsicosociales. EnglishThe prevalence rates of inhalant use among adolescents highlight a serious and under studied problem until date. Inhalants are a diverse group of volatile substances whose chemical vapors can be inhaled to produce psychoactive (mind-altering) effects. Because of its accessibility inhalants could be considered harmless, but in fact they are harmfully and have been related to negative effects on consumers’ health. Factors such as crime, antisocial personality, to grow up in a dysfunctional family, to be a “street child”, or the presence of comorbid mental disorders, have been associated with the development of inhalant use disorders among young people. A stronger effort is needed to conduct inhalants abuse research in order to increase the present knowledge, and to implement interventions for these disorders and its biopsychosocial implications.",

Delta-8-THC is a mildly euphoric isomer of psychoactive delta-9-THC. Delta-8-THC is typically synthesized from cannabidiol (CBD) extracted from hemp. The reaction often yields a high percentage of delta-8-THC, as well as small amounts of other cannabinoids and reaction by-products. Little is known about the health effects of these impurities, and chemists have not identified all of them. Move over cannabidiol (CBD). The popularity of another cannabinoid, ∆ 8 -tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-8-THC), is on the rise. Found in gummies, vape cartridges, tinctures, and other products, delta-8-THC is popping up in gas stations, convenience stores, tobacco shops, and cannabis dispensaries throughout the US and beyond—often with no age restrictions. Unlike CBD, delta-8-THC produces euphoric effects that are similar to but milder than those of delta-9-THC, the well-known psychoactive compound",

      "abstract": "Nonostante il fumo di sigarette sia un comportamento dannoso per la salute, la sua diffusione e ampia e coinvolge persone di tutte le eta e di tutti i livelli socio-culturali. In particolare, il consumo di sigarette si presenta in genere per la prima volta in adolescenza ed in questo stesso periodo dello sviluppo tende o ad essere abbandonato o a stabilizzarsi in un’abitudine adulta. Diventa quindi importante indagare questa fascia di eta per capire quali siano i fattori che incidono sia sulla sperimentazione che sull’eventuale stabilizzazione del consumo. La ricerca qui presentata ha i seguenti obiettivi: descrivere il coinvolgimento nel fumo di un campione di 2.273 adolescenti che frequentano diversi tipi di scuole medie superiori; analizzare, attraverso un modello causale multifattoriale, l’influenza di variabili individuali, contestuali e sociali sul consumo di sigarette; valutare il peso dei concomitanti e dei predittori psico-sociali dell’implicazione dei ragazzi e delle ragazze. I principali risultati evidenziano come il fumo di sigarette svolga, per l’adolescente che vi e implicato, delle funzioni positive che hanno un impatto ben piu forte rispetto alla consapevolezza della nocivita del comportamento. In particolare, il fumo puo essere interpretato come un modo per esprimere l’identita adulta in eta precoce, ma anche come una modalita trasgressiva di affermazione vistosa di se, come una strategia per farsi degli amici, per essere accettati in alcuni gruppi e per rafforzare l’identificazione all’interno del gruppo. Talvolta il fumo si configura come una fuga e come un modo di occupare il in assenza di altre capacita progettuali. Tra i fattori di rischio per la stabilizzazione del consumo, la consapevolezza da parte dei genitori che i figli fumano risulta essere il piu importante; anche la bassa autoefficacia scolastica, lo scarso sostegno da parte dei genitori, l’uso casuale e non pianificato del tempo libero hanno un impatto significativo.",

      "abstract": "Through doping, we understand the use by athletes of substances prohibited by the anti-doping agencies in order to gain a competitive advantage. Since sport plays an important role in physical and mental education and in promoting international understanding and cooperation, the widespread use of doping products and methods has consequences not only on health of the athletes, but also upon the image of sport. Thus, doping in sports is forbidden for both ethical and medical reasons. Narcotics and analgesics, anabolic steroids, hormones, selective androgen receptor modulators are among the most frequently utilized substances. Although antidoping controls are becoming more rigorous, doping and, very importantly, masking doping methods are also advancing, and these are usually one step ahead of doping detection techniques. Depending on the sport practiced and the physical attributes it requires, the athletes will look for one or more of the following benefits of doping: recovering from an injury, increasing body recovery capacity after training, increasing muscle mass and strength, decreasing fat tissue, increasing endurance. Finally, when we look once again at a doping scandal, amazed at how much animosity against those caught can exist; the question is: is it really such a disaster as presented by the media or a silent truth under our eyes, but which many of us have refused to accept?",

      "title": "Risks of Attempting to Regulate Nicotine Flux in Electronic Cigarettes",
      "abstract": "In their recent analysis, Shihadeh and Eissenberg1 support that by regulating nicotine flux in electronic cigarettes (ECs) could be a valuable tool in the regulatory process that would increase effectiveness and reduce the chance for abuse liability. Herein, we present the view that such a regulation could endanger the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as smoking substitutes.\r\n\r\nNicotine Delivery From Tobacco Cigarettes\r\nAlthough tobacco cigarettes deliver 1–3mg of nicotine (from about 14mg in each rod), the levels of daily nicotine intake may vary considerably between users. This is partly attributed to a substantial variability in nicotine intake per cigarette caused by different smoking intensity.2 It is also possible to smoke more than one cigarette consecutively, further avoiding the limitation of the tobacco cigarette rod standardized design. Therefore, smokers can adjust cigarette use based on personal needs, while it is extremely unlikely for smoking to cause nicotine intoxication or overdose.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicotine Delivery From ECs\r\nElectronic cigarettes differ remarkably from tobacco cigarettes in terms of nicotine delivery. There is no standardized unit of consumption. Consumers usually report their daily consumption in milliliters of liquid,3 which cannot be directly compared with daily cigarette consumption. The variability in equipment design and potential, and the range of nicotine content in EC liquids provide consumers with the ability to adjust use patterns and nicotine intake. Surveys of dedicated EC users (which were all former smokers) have shown that high nicotine levels are important especially for the initiation of EC use.3,4 Although nicotine delivery to the aerosol can be similar or higher than tobacco cigarettes,5,6 clinical studies of EC use have shown that the nicotine absorption potential is significantly lower compared with tobacco cigarettes, even when new generation devices are used.7 This is mostly attributed to the low speed of nicotine absorption, and clearly indicates that nicotine intoxication is highly unlikely when ECs are used as intended. Therefore, despite the ability to adjust use patterns, ECs are currently not as efficient as tobacco cigarettes in nicotine delivery.\r\n\r\nWe propose that the comparison between ECs and tobacco cigarettes would be similar to comparing, respectively a car with a large selection of powerful (in selected cases) engines (i.e., nicotine delivery to the aerosol) but very heavy structure (i.e., reduced rate of absorption for a given nicotine content per puff), with a car with less variability and lower-powered engines but very lightweight structure. With current technology, overall performance (i.e., nicotine delivery to the bloodstream) is definitely in favor of the tobacco cigarette, and smokers may be unable to adequately satisfy their nicotine cravings with EC use despite the ability to adjust use patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pleasure Factor in EC Use\r\nIt is physiologically plausible to support that nicotine induces pleasure and reduces anxiety in smokers.8 The pleasure factor has been largely neglected and marginalized by the tobacco control movement which is usually following the pathology paradigm framework for nicotine use.9 Perceived pleasure should not be a reason for anyone to initiate smoking (due to exposure to known risks for health damage) or EC use (due to exposure to yet unknown, although evidently much lower than smoking, risk). However, it should be considered and evaluated when discussing about smoking substitution. Surveys indicate that pleasure could be a potential reason for smokers to choose and maintain long-term EC use.3,10 This is probably one of the main reasons for the enormous variability of different flavors available in EC liquids,10 and could explain the variability of devices with different characteristics, design, and properties. The recent development and marketing of atomizers with adjustable airflow probably reflects the different preferences by users, and the effort of manufacturers to create products which can be customized based on self-preference. Since the main objective should always be elimination of smoking, the pleasure effect could be an advantage of ECs over other products which should be welcomed if it contributes to smoking reduction or cessation. Further studies are needed to examine this aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs There a Need to Regulate Nicotine Flux in ECs?\r\nBased on the evidence presented above, and with current technological evolution, it is our opinion that regulating nicotine flux in ECs, in terms of restricting usage patterns (e.g., restrict puff duration or apply a minimum interpuff interval), is unnecessary. It carries the potential risk of reducing ECs’ efficacy as smoking substitutes, while it provides no benefit in terms of safety. There is already the example of regulatory decisions by the European Union, which defined an upper limit of 20mg/ml nicotine concentration in EC liquids (http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/dir_201440_en.pdf) based on information about potential nicotine delivery to the aerosol.6 They failed to recognize that both effectiveness and abuse liability are determined by nicotine absorption (speed and amount delivered to the blood stream) rather than nicotine delivery to the aerosol. As a result, it is possible that such a restriction could exclude some smokers from effectively using ECs as smoking substitutes.\r\n\r\nResearch on nicotine flux could become an essential tool in the development of more effective EC products and in informing consumers about the characteristics of each device so that they make appropriate choices. There are two options for ECs development: (a) using higher nicotine concentration in liquid and (b) improving the absorption rate. The former results in intense (and, for many users, unbearable) throat irritation (“throat hit”), added to the irritation induced by the humectants in the aerosol (propylene glycol and glycerol). The latter may occur from adjusting use behavior (e.g., taking longer and deeper puffs, although this may make the use tiring), adjusting power delivery (which leads to more liquid consumption and aerosol production per given puff duration) and reformulating EC liquids in order to deliver and deposit nicotine more effectively into the lungs. It is possible that improvement in nicotine delivery efficacy could make ECs more addictive. This is not a concern for smokers (who are already nicotine-dependent) but for nonsmokers who may adopt EC use. However, this raises an important ethical issue: should a product, which is probably beneficial for a part of the population (smokers), be restricted (which could result in reduced efficacy as a smoking substitute) because some other parts of the population (nonsmokers) decide to voluntarily adopt its use and expose themselves to a new (even minor) risk? Measures such as proper education, regulation of advertising, and prohibition of promotion and sales to nonsmoking youth could effectively ensure that ECs will not be used by nonsmokers without restricting their potential to substitute smoking.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the most preventable cause of death in the United States, accounting for the deaths of approximately 140,000 women annually. Despite the known health risks, women continue to begin and continue smoking at high rates. Like other addictive drugs, nicotine becomes reinforcing with repeated use, induces euphoric sensations, and is self-administered. Tolerance to nicotine's effects develops rapidly and leads to increased use. Reducing or suppressing tobacco consumption produces a withdrawal syndrome characterized by irritability, difficulty concentrating, cognitive impairments, and weight gain. These withdrawal symptoms, along with other factors, lead to relapse rates comparable to those following cessation from other addictive drugs. This review article discusses the pathogenesis of nicotine addiction compared to other addictive substances such as cocaine and heroin with an effort to provide comparative data for men and women.",

      "abstract": "Because of recent resurgence in its consumption, the effects and health consequences of smokeless tobacco are of considerable public health interest. We studied the extent and time course of absorption of nicotine and cardiovascular effects of smokeless tobacco (oral snuff and chewing tobacco) and compared it with smoking cigarettes and chewing nicotine gum in 10 healthy volunteers. Maximum levels of nicotine were similar but, because of prolonged absorption, overall nicotine exposure was twice as large after single exposures to smokeless tobacco compared with cigarette smoking. All tobacco use increased heart rate and blood pressure, with a tendency toward a greater overall cardiovascular effect despite evidence of development of some tolerance to effects of nicotine with use of smokeless tobacco. Relatively low levels of nicotine and lesser cardiovascular responses were observed with use of nicotine gum. Adverse health consequences of smoking that are nicotine related would be expected to present a similar hazard with the use of smokeless tobacco.

Yet these athletes and hundreds, perhaps thousands of others regularly use drugs in the course of their training, performance, or both. I am talking not about recreational drug use-athletes use drugs for pleasure and relaxation probably no more or less than their contemporaries with comparable incomes-but about a much less discussed type of drug use: taking drugs to enhance performance. It is a strange idea. Most of us think of drugs in one of two ways. Either they are being properly used by doctors and patients to make sick people well or at least to stem the ravages of illness and pain, or they are being misused-we say abused-by individuals in pursuit of unworthy pleasures.

      "abstract": "Smoking has been viewed in divergent ways throughout history. While for some cultures it has been considered a crime, for others it has been invested with magical powers and even medicinal potential. In our century, society has come to realize the health risks associated with smoking. This has led to controversies between government and the tobacco industry as well as between physician and patient. In spite of their knowledge of its deadly consequences, many individuals are unable to stop smoking. The tenacity of this habit can be explained in terms of the various psychological motivations for smoking in combination with the physiologic addiction to nicotine. While some people are able to stop the habit, many relapse in spite of a variety of quitting methods. These range from the doctor's advice to stop, education programs, group and individual psychotherapies, behavioral techniques, hypnosis, and the use of nicotine gum. With a growing understanding of what distinguishes categories of smokers and with a new appreciation for the role of nicotine in addiction to smoking, more effective antismoking strategies can be fashioned to meet the specific needs of the potential quitter.",

Nicorette® could serve as at least the partial antidote to nico-wrong (cigarettes). However, as relapse to smoking has remained the most likely outcome of any smoking cessation attempt, so medicinal nicotine has also served to demonstrate that nicotine addiction is ultimately a problem of an uncontrollable appetite for cigarettes in excess of drug dependence.Implications – Pharmaceutical incursion on cigarette smoking commencing in the late 1970s pointed to the need for a new mental disease model of drug-related problems while also providing valuable new tools and insights for ensuing brain research.",

Drug consumption is far more likely to incite public concern over the harmful and habit forming properties of certain substances, than conjure up an enthusiasm born of the 1960s for their potential to produce a sincere mystical experience. However, the recent emergence of religious movements who consume plant hallucinogens as their sacrament, and the growth of drug tourism for the spiritually inclined, reflects a renaissance in the use of psychoactive plants and chemicals for spiritual inspiration. This trend presents a challenge to the way in which certain drugs are culturally and legally defined, and brings the concept of religious freedom into the sphere of drug policy.",

      "title": "Alterações neuropsicológicas causadas pelo uso crônico da Cocaína",
      "abstract": "Introdução: A cocaína é uma substância psicoativa de origem vegetal, podendo ser consumida por diversas vias: oral, intravenosa e respiratória (crack), sendo essa última a que ocasiona os maiores prejuízos ao organismo. Atua no sistema de recompensa cerebral (brain reward system), através do bloqueio na recaptação de neurotransmissores como a noradrenalina, dopamina e serotonina. Acredita-se que, ao bloquear a recaptação da dopamina, por exemplo, a concentração desse neurotransmissor na fenda sináptica (espaço entre os neurônios) seja aumentada, fenômeno que tem como resultado as sensações de euforia e prazer, que são associadas ao uso da droga. É inegável, portanto, que o uso abusivo de cocaína é um problema cada vez maior na sociedade, visto que o consumo da droga gera diversos problemas à economia pública e à saúde, pois eleva a violência e, assim, os gastos do governo, além de desencadear uma série de complicações ao organismo de seus usuários, aumentando os índices de morbidade e mortalidade populacional. Objetivos: O objetivo do presente estudo é realizar uma revisão de literatura sobre algumas das alterações neuropsicológicas ocasionadas pelo uso crônico da cocaína e promover o maior entendimento sobre os mecanismos de ação da droga. Metodologia: Para a realização da revisão de literatura, será feita uma busca na Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde e na base de dados Scielo. Inicialmente, o descritor de assunto escolhido será “cocaína”. Em seguida, a busca deverá ser refinada com os termos “alterações neuropsicológicas” e “dependência”. Discussão: Dentre algumas funções estudadas pela neuropsicologia, torna-se importante ressaltar, principalmente, as funções executivas, as capacidade mnemônica e as funções atencionais. Funções executivas são atividades cognitivas superiores que ajudam a manter um arranjo mental apropriado para alcançar um objetivo futuro, necessitando do desempenho de processos de focalização atencional, inibição, gerenciamento de tarefas, planejamento e monitoramento na execução de um comportamento dirigido a determinados objetivos. Prejuízos na atenção e na flexibilidade mental também são observados nesses sujeitos, o que resulta em problemas na memória de trabalho. Ademais, observam-se dificuldades nos processos mnemônicos, quando a tarefa exigida requer um tempo e uma maior elaboração. Podem apresentar também prejuízos na capacidade não verbal de resolução de problemas, memória espacial, nomeação de objetos e velocidade perceptomotora quando o uso é contínuo por um período de quatro anos ou mais (HOFF et al., 1996). Em relação aos aspectos atencionais, sujeitos dependentes de cocaína comumente revelam um comprometimento na capacidade de reter informações e sustentar a atenção por um período prolongado de tempo, principalmente quando as tarefas exigem uma maior elaboração (ANDRADE; SANTOS; BUENO, 2004). No entanto, Selby e Azrin (1998) também realizaram estudos com pessoas dependentes de cocaína em um período de três anos de abstinência e não foi encontrada nenhuma diferença significativa entre o desempenho dos usuários e do grupo controle, o que sugere que, após um longo período de abstinência, é possível que a atividade neuroquímica se regularize. Conclusão: A cocaína, por ser uma droga psicoestimulante com ação de reforçadora positiva, apresenta altos índices de abuso e dependência. No entanto, estudos mostraram ser possível que a atividade cerebral seja regularizada com longos períodos de abstinência. Para tanto, torna-se necessária às aplicações das melhores estratégias médicas para cada caso específico, mas, principalmente, a adesão e o comprometimento do dependente químico a esses programas de reabilitação.",

As our knowledge into basic behavioural and physiologic mechanisms has grown, so has our ability to improve treatment tools. Nonetheless, although we have ever more effective tools available which patients can use to help them stop smoking, there is no magic bullet that is going to make the smoker quit.\n\nNicotine replacement therapy, currently the most effective tool at our disposal to treat tobacco dependence, is an integral part of smoking cessation treatment. However, since each smoking patient has individual needs which must be met in order to stop smoking successfully, individualisation of treatment is a necessity for sustained smoking cessation. First, though, let us review some basic nicotine replacement therapy facts. Earlier in this conference, we reviewed material which shows that there are two fundamental, inter-linked forces driving cigarette smoking: psychological dependency and nicotine dependency. However, it is artificial to think of these driving forces as being different, because in reality they both describe various factors which affect neurotransmitter activity in the brain. Intrinsic mood states, external events (such as a pleasurable encounter with a friend), or drugs of abuse all affect brain neurochemical activity and thus change the way we feel, how we think, and how we respond to the world around us.\n\nIn the context of cigarette smoking, a large number of external factors, such as neutral habit situations, can affect neurotransmitter release rates in the brain, which serve to link smoking with those activities, and those activities with smoking. For example, having a cup of coffee, making a phone call, having a cocktail, being around other smokers, or after a meal, all can serve as …",

Das oesterreichische Kraftfahrrecht traegt dieser Problematik insofern Rechnung, als sowohl die Verkehrszuverlaessigkeit als auch die gesundheitliche Eignung von Drogenkonsumenten direkt in Zweifel gezogen wird. Ebenso zweifelhaft ist aber auch, ob die noetige kraftfahrspezifische Leistungsfaehigkeit und die noetige Bereitschaft zur Verkehrsanpassung im ausreichenden Masse vorhanden sind. Die Leistungsfunktionen koennen bei laenger dauerndem Drogenkonsum auch im nicht akut beeintraechtigten Zustand deutlich herabgesetzt sein. Ebenso stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit eine ausreichende Bereitschaft vorhanden ist, einen vielleicht nur sehr sporadischen Drogenkonsum von der Teilnahme am Strassenverkehr strikt zu trennen. Beide Punkte lassen sich im Rahmen einer verkehrspsychologischen Untersuchung mit Hilfe standardisierter Leistungstests und Persoenlichkeitsverfahren sowie einer ausfuehrlichen Exploration klaeren.

Withdrawal symptoms include craving, irritability, anxiety, restlessness, and increased appetite. Smokers have elevated exhaled carbon monoxide and serum carboxyhemoglobin levels. Cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, can be detected in blood and urine. Many medical conditions are associated with tobacco use (particularly smoking), including cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and a variety of malignancies.

Es una investigacion que se utilizan los metodos Descriptivo y Deductivo  se complementan en el proceso de la investigacion y nos permiten emplear estrategias de razonamiento empleada para la deduccion y llegar a conclusiones logicas a partir de una serie de premisas o principios, para alcanzar un objetivo, un fin propuesto de antemano, buscando las formas apropiadas.\r\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Sustancias; Psicotropicas; Psicoactivas; Adolescentes.\r\nABSTRACTThe consumption of psychotropic and psychoactive substances comes from time immemorial in all cultures and times, they have been used as drugs, to disinhibit behaviors, the discriminated use of psychoactive substances have become a social and health problem that affects our youth. Drug use is often associated with heroin, but the reality is that in adolescence the prevailing use is legal drugs such as alcohol and nicotine. Followed by hashish, marijuana, coca derivatives (bazuco, pasta and cocaine salts). It is given the greatest use in young people because it is easier to acquire and much more economical, as well as easy preparation, greater stimulation and less dependence; However, a number of young people are already trapped in drug addiction, an issue that affects everyone. The objective of the research was to determine the factors associated with the consumption of psychotropic or psychoactive substances of adolescents of the Camilo Ponce parish, Babahoyo city, second semester 2016. It is an investigation that the descriptive and deductive methods are used to complement each other in the process of research and allow us to employ reasoning strategies used for deduction and reach logical conclusions from a series of premises or principles, to achieve an objective, a purpose proposed in advance, looking for the appropriate forms.\r\nKEYWORDS: Substances; Psychotropic; Psicoactives; Adolescents.\r\nREFERENCIAS BIBLIOGRAFICAS\r\nAgua., A.

      "abstract": "The most effective way to reduce the health hazards associated with smoking is to prevent children from taking up the habit and to develop better programs to help smokers quit; however given the large number of smokers it is also necessary to determine the relationship between specific tobacco smoke components and the development of various diseases so that manufacturers can develop less harmful cigarettes. In reference to smoking prevention among children educational programs necessitating the active participation of students are more effective than passive programs. In passive programs the student is simply lectured on the effects of smoking but in active programs they are required to record over a period of time their health habits in conjunction with the results of cholesterol blood pressure and physical fitness tests. Smoking cessation clinics offering long term assistance to their clients have higher success rates for one year than clinics providing only short term help. Efforts to clarify the relationship between specific tobacco components and the development of diseases need to be intensified. In reference to cancer a number of animal carcinogens have been found in tobacco smoke. Although a causal relationship between these substances and the development of specific cancers in man has not been proved it is advisable to reduce the amount of these substances in cigarettes. In regard to cardiovascular disease nicotine has been shown to indirectly affect ventricular fibrillation but the role of carbon monoxide in the development of arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease is still in dispute. The relationship between specific components and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has not been determined. The use of filtered cigarettes has reduced the risk of larynx and lung cancer but its role in the development of other diseases has not yet been determined. Graphs include 1) % of teenage smokers by year and by sex; 2) test results comparing smoking habits of an experimental group in an active smoking program with a control group; 3) % distribution of nonsmokers ex-smokers and smokers by sex and education; 4) cigarette sales information for low tar types; and 5) % distribution of lung and larynx cancer cases for filtered and nonfiltered cigarette smokers by sex and amount smoked. Summary tables listing tumor initiating agents carcinogenic agents and organ specific carcinogens in tobacco smoke are provided.",

I use routine, work, and responsibility to keep my own addictive tendencies in check.

Data from two separate studies of smokers were reanalyzed to examine associations between acute subjective and cardiovascular effects of nicotine vs. caffeine and between nicotine vs. alcohol. Typical intakes of cigarettes, alcohol, and caffeine were included as covariates when they were correlated with the responses of interest. Significant associations between nicotine and caffeine were seen for most of the subjective measures and for blood pressure responses. Fewer significant associations were observed between nicotine and alcohol. Responses associated between nicotine and both of the other drugs tended to reflect psychomotor stimulation. These results suggest that smokers who are more responsive to some of nicotine's subjective and blood pressure effects are also more sensitive to the same effects of caffeine and, to a lesser extent, of alcohol.",

Many consumers believe that because herbal supplements are natural products, they are somewhat safer or more effective than traditional prescribed medications. This is also one reason that alternative medicine is growing and gaining more popularity. On the other hand, adverse reactions to herbal supplements or their interactions with patients' current medications are no different than pharmaceutical medicines. We report a case of premature ventricular contraction associated with two herbal supplements. These products contained multiple different herbs and both included large doses of guarana. Guarana, which is found in some supplements marketed in U.S., contains a substantial amount of caffeine. Although the exact cause of tachycardia in our report is not proven, a large amount of caffeine consumption is thought to be a possible causal effect. The purpose of this report is to remind health care professionals to evaluate and educate patients on the use of herbal products and any potential adverse reactions, drug interactions, or possible toxicities.",

Our findings show that impulse control can develop in adult populations as a result of exercising routine behaviors in naturally occurring environments. This finding is important because the ability to control tempting impulses significantly impacts the health and well-being of people at all ages. Our findings complement theory by providing rigorous empirical evidence that simple lifestyle changes may have significant personal well-being benefits. In particular, small acts of self-control, such as resisting drinking or always waking at the same time, can increase one’s overall ability to resist selfish temptations.",

Health professionals are increasingly being exposed to teenagers who use alcohol and drugs.

Both experimental data and clinical reports suggest that medications play a major role in age-related chemosensory changes. Over 250 drugs have been reported clinically to affect the sense of taste. Taste impairments from medications include: ageusia (absence of taste), hypogeusia (diminished sensitivity of taste), and dysgeusia (distortion of normal taste). The sites of action for most pharmaceutical compounds that induce taste losses are not known, but medications can act at several levels including peripheral receptors, chemosensory neural pathways, and/or the brain. Extensive research has shown that drugs are secreted into the saliva, and salivary levels of many drugs are high enough to exert adverse effects on taste sensations either by modifying taste transduction mechanisms or by producing a taste of their own.",

      "abstract": "The question as to how we should classify continued tobacco consumption despite a smoker’s desire to quit, diagnostically, is a recurring one. On the one hand, there are supporters for the view that tobacco addiction equates to other addictive diseases. Others argue for classifying smoking as either simply a lifestyle choice or, at worst, a lack of consistent commitment to quit.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that motivating a smoker to stop consuming tobacco is a key piece of primary prevention, by preventing cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancies, to name just a few. However, classifying smoking as an addictive disease has far-reaching and practical implications for treatment: abstinence needs to be promoted and stabilized with the help of medically supported psychotherapeutic interventions as well as simple motivational measures. Moreover, withdrawal should be supported with medication.",

They are utilized as a substitute for marijuana, primarily for their psychoactive properties. Consumption has been rapidly increasing due to recreational effects, easy accessibility, and not being detectable by urine drug screening tests. The side effect profile of synthetic cannabinoids involves many organs and is not well known to the public. Psychoses are a common adverse result from their consumption. Primary care physicians and other medical professionals should consider synthetic cannabinoid consumption in the differential diagnoses of a patient presenting with psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Minuman beralkohol bagi sebagian orang merupakan bukti kejantanan atau ke-modern-an dalam pergaulan. Ironisnya minuman ini tidak hanya dikomsumsi oleh orang dewasa, akan tetapi kaum remaja sudah mulai coba-coba mencicipinya. Pola hidup yang tidak sehat yang banyak diterapkan oleh kaum dewasa awal ini juga dapat membentuk sebuah ketergantungan. Salah satunya adalah ketergantungan pada obat-obatan terlarang dan alkohol. Ketergantungan (addiction) adalah ketergantungan fisik pada suatu obat. Ketergantungan psikologis (psychological dependence) adalah kebutuhan untuk menggunakan obat-obatan untuk mengatasi masalah dan stres. Obat-obatan psikoaktif, yaitu semua obat yang mempengaruhi sistem syaraf untuk mengubah keadaan, mengubah persepsi dan mengubah suasana hati; memiliki peran yang kuat dalam ketergantungan baik fisik maupun psikologis. Pemulihan bagi pecandu alcohol dalam perspektif Islam adalah bagaimana individu itu bisa mengendalikan emosi dirinya untuk tidak minum minuman yang beralkohol. Terlebih jika alcohol dijadikan pelarian dari masalah-masalah yang tengah dihadapi. Individu yang menjadi pecandu alcohol umumnya bersifat pemarah, dan hal tersebut merupakan gangguan kepribadian dalam domain keihsanan. Berwudhu dan membaca shalawat Nabi Saw merupakan salah satu terapi untuk dapat meredakan kemarahan termasuk yang diakibatkan oleh alkohol.",

Environmental factors and how individuals react to them can, therefore, have powerful influences on drinking behavior. On the other hand, the neuropsychopharmacological actions of ethanol and how different individuals react to them can be important biological determinants. Ethanol's action is biphasic, i.e., it can be reinforcing (rewarding) in the low concentration range, but averse at high concentrations.1 Perception by the individual of the reinforcing actions of ethanol might be expected to maintain alcohol-seeking behavior, whereas aversive effects would be expected to extinguish this behavior. Identification of the environmental and biological variables that promote and maintain alcohol-seeking or alcohol self-administration behavior is key to our understanding of the disorder alcoholism itself.",

      "title": "FAKTOR PENYEBAB TERJADINYA TINDAK PIDANA PENYALAHGUNAAN NARKOTIKA OLEH ANGGOTA POLRI WILAYAH HUKUM POLRESTA PADANG",
      "abstract": "Dalam awal perkembangannya, narkotika, psikotoprika, dan zat adiktif lainnya (NARKOBA) dikenal dan\r\ndipergunakan manusia untuk mengatasi berbagai masalah terutama untuk kepentingan kesehatan dan sosial. Hanya saja\r\nselain dari pengaruh positifnya, bahan-bahan ini juga banyak mengandung pengaruh negatif yang sangat membahayakan\r\nbagi kelangsungan hidup manusia. Pada masa ini narkotika tidak saja dipergunakan sebagai bahan-bahan untuk\r\nmenunjang kesehatan namun dipergunakan untuk tujuan lain yaitu untuk menimbulkan rasa senang, tenang, tenteram,\r\nberani, kuat juga hebat bagi penggunanya. Polisi selaku penyidik supaya melakukan tindakan tegas kepada para\r\npenyelundup, pembuat narkoba, pengedar untuk menerapkan ancaman hukuman tertinggi dalam Undang-Undang\r\nNarkoba. Akan tetapi dengan tugas dan tanggung jawab yang seperti itu, justru Polri sebagai penegak hukum juga ikut\r\nserta mengkonsumsi narkotika tersebut. Hal ini dapat dibuktikan berdasarkan data tahunan penyalahgunaan narkotika\r\noleh Polri di Polresta Kota Padang, membuktikan tingkat penyalahgunaan narkotika yang dilakukan oleh anggota Polri\r\nselalu ada tiap tahunnya. Hal ini patut dipertanyakan, mengapa anggota Polri tersebut bisa ikut serta dalam\r\npenyalahgunaan narkotika sedangkan dia merupakan aparat penegak hukum. Polri yang melakukan penyalahgunaan\r\nnarkotika tersebut khususnya pemakai juga dijerat dalam UU. No 35 Tahun 2009 tentang narkotika dalam Pasal 111 dan\r\n112, dan Polri tersebut juga akan mendapatkan sanksi profesi yang terdapat dalam Peraturan Kepala Kepolisian Negara\r\nRepublik Indonesia NO. POL. : 7 Tahun 2006. Penelitian dilakukan di Polresta Kota Padang yang bertujuan untuk: a)\r\nmengetahui apakah faktor yang melandasi terjadinya penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri, b) mengetahui\r\nbagaimana upaya penanggulangan dari tindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika yang dilakukan oleh anggota Polri, c)\r\nmengetahui kendala-kendala yang dihadapi dalam menanggulangi terjadinya tindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika\r\noleh anggota Polri. Dalam penelitian ini digunakan metode yuridis sosiologis dengan spesifikasi pembahasannya yaitu\r\ndeskriptif, teknik pengumpulan datanya studi dokumen dan penelitian lapangan melalui wawancara, kemudian dianalisis\r\nsecara kualitatif. Dari hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan bahwa faktor penyebab terjadinya tindak pidana\r\npenyalahgunaan narktika oleh anggota Polri adalah: a) faktor individu, faktor ini terdapat dalam pribadi anggota Polri\r\nsendiri yang meliputi emosi dan rasa penasaran terhadap narkotika, b) faktor lingkungan, terdapat dalam lingkungan\r\nPolri yang sering berhadapan dengan narkotika sehingga anggota Polri sulit untuk menghindari keinginan untuk\r\nmencoba barang haram tersebut. Upaya penanggulangan penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh Polri dilakukan dengan: upaya\r\npreentif yaitu berupa himbauan/ teguran saja dan dalam upaya ini terdapat penerapan 2 program, upaya preventif\r\ndilakukan dengan penerapan 3 program, upaya represif yakni penindakan secara hukum semua jenis tindak pidana\r\npenyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri. Kendala yang dihadapi polisi dalam penerapan program penanggulangan\r\ntindak pidana penyalahgunaan narkotika oleh anggota Polri terbagi dalam kendala internal dan kebndala eksternal.",

The relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of incident dementia is however not clear. Many studies have demonstrated that alcohol consumption in mild to moderate level, compared with abstention, lowers the risk of dementia. Other studies however do not suggest such association. There are several mechanisms to describe the positive effects of alcohol consumption on the brain function. One to two drinks daily of alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, or liquor) could lower the risk of dementia. The types of alcoholic beverages are not significantly different in such association. In conclusion, it would seem that a mild to moderate level of alcohol consumption might be associated with a lower risk of dementia.",

TreatmentDespite the availability of effective treatments, few people with bulimia nervosa seek help.One study found that only 1 in 10 people with the condition are in treatment. 1 Treatments that are likely to workAntidepressants Antidepressants can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.There is not enough evidence on how long the benefits last or for comparing the effects of different classes of antidepressants.Antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy are equally effective for bulimia nervosa, though dropout rates are higher with antidepressants, probably due to their side effects.For information on drug doses, see www.besttreatments.org/bulimianervosa. Cognitive behaviour therapyAs with antidepressants, cognitive behaviour therapy can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.It may be preferable to medication in patients who are sensitive to, or wish to avoid, side effects of medication.Cognitive behaviour therapy and other psychological treatments seem to be equally good at treating binge eating, although cognitive behaviour therapy is better at improving depression scores.There is some evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy has long term benefits in treating bulimia, but there is insufficient evidence about patients' characteristics that predict response.",

      "abstract": "The number one cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States is tobacco use. According to data from the National Health Interview Survey, 18.7% of US adults (46 million people) currently use a tobacco product. Smoking causes lung, laryngeal, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancers and possibly breast cancer. Nicotine is the highly addictive component of tobacco that releases dopamine when it binds to alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. This produces reward sensations that become associated with specific behaviors and relieves stress and negative emotions. Public policy changes, behavioral interventions, and pharmacologic approaches have been shown to reduce tobacco use. Combining behavior therapy with pharmacotherapy increases cessation rates. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved five nicotine replacement therapies and two no-nicotine oral medications to assist with smoking cessation. Medications are categorized as controllers or relievers based on their pharmacokinetics. Nicotine replacement therapy delivers lower amounts of nicotine and needs to be titrated to alleviate patient cravings. Varenicline is a selective partial agonist at the alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and is recommended over bupropion for smoking cessation.",

Substance use, including heavy drinking, often occurs at the expense of other, substance-free, activities. This review examines the promotion of one specific substance-free activity—exercise—as an intervention for hazardous drinking. Exercise has numerous physical and mental health benefits, and data suggest that students who engage in exercise regularly are less likely to drink heavily. However, the adherence to exercise necessary to achieve these benefits and possibly reduce drinking is poor, and improved exercise adherence interventions are needed. A novel combination of motivational enhancement therapy and contingency management is discussed as a means to address the critical issue of exercise adherence.",

In most cases, when obese people lose weight their knees are under less pressure to hold them up, and the pain disappears or reduces dramatically. For people who have knee problems, strengthening certain muscles helps get them back to a normal active life. Back problems are the most common issue faced in our sedentary lifestyle.

Their success has been dramatic but partial and excruciatingly slow, and until recently quite uncoerced by government. Cigarettes and nicotine have characteristics distinct among addictive drugs, and some of these help explain why efforts to quit smoking are so often frustrated. Nicotine itself is the most interesting chemical in the treatment of addiction and, in some forms, can pose a dilemma: compromise by settling for pure nicotine indefinitely, or stay with cigarettes and keep trying to quit. Nicotine is not alone among addictive drugs in becoming increasingly identified with the poorer classes.",

      "abstract": "En las ultimas decadas ha adquirido especial relevancia, entre los jovenes y adolescentes, el patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol, el cual presenta alta prevalencia en la mayoria de los paises occidentales. En la literatura anglosajona se denomina binge drinking (BD) y se caracteriza por la ingesta de grandes cantidades de alcohol en un corto periodo de tiempo, normalmente el fin de semana, que suele llevar a la embriaguez, y alternando periodos de abstinencia entre los episodios de consumo intensivo. El consumo intensivo de alcohol (CIA) parece resultar significativamente mas danino para el cerebro que su consumo regular, y mayores aun son las implicaciones al tratarse de poblacion juvenil. El cortex prefrontal, soporte neuronal de los procesos ejecutivos y de los rasgos de personalidad, parece resultar especialmente afectado por el consumo de alcohol. Aspectos como la desinhibicion o la impulsividad, plausiblemente mediado por la actividad neuronal en los circuitos prefrontales se han considerado como una consecuencia habitual del consumo de alcohol; sin embargo esta misma impulsividad puede representar un indicador de vulnerabilidad para la adiccion al alcohol y otras sustancias. El objetivo general de este estudio es determinar las relaciones existentes entre el consumo intensivo de alcohol en jovenes y su actividad prefrontal, estimada a partir de su rendimiento neuropsicologico y su perfil de personalidad. Los resultados obtenidos nos permiten establecer las siguientes conclusiones: Existen diferencias en el perfil de personalidad entre los jovenes CIA y No CIA. El perfil de personalidad de los sujetos CIA permite explicar aspectos relacionados con el consumo de alcohol. De este perfil, el factor desinhibicion es el que mejor explica estas conductas. El mayor consumo de alcohol se asocia con mas errores atencionales y disminucion de la velocidad de procesamiento, pero no con menor rendimiento en memoria de trabajo u otras funciones ejecutivas. Existe asociacion entre el perfil de personalidad CIA y el rendimiento neuropsicologico. El perfil de personalidad predice en mayor grado que el rendimiento en las pruebas neuropsicologicas el consumo de alcohol al cabo de dos anos. El mantenimiento del patron CIA implica la persistencia de diferencias de rendimiento en tareas de control atencional y velocidad de procesamiento, sensibles al funcionamiento prefrontal.",

People may be unaware that supplements can contain caffeine, even if caffeine is not listed as an ingredient. Commonly used herbal dietary supplement ingredients, such as guarana, are natural sources of caffeine. Additions of these natural sources of caffeine to dietary supplements have increased in recent years. We describe a case of possible caffeine-induced seizure in a patient taking an over-the-counter weight loss supplement. A previously healthy 38-year-old female experienced blurring of vision and a new onset grand mal seizure. The patient had a 2-month history of taking the dietary supplement, Zantrex-3™. Zantrex-3™ is advertised as a weight loss supplement, which may provide rapid weight loss and extreme energy in one \"power packed pill.\" Zantrex-3™ is a proprietary blend containing niacin, caffeine, and various herbs. After presenting to the hospital emergency room, the patient's chemistry panel, with the exception of potassium (2.9 mEq/L), was within normal limits. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was unremarkable. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed possible atrophy in the right frontal lobe. Findings from follow-up MRI and EEG ordered as an outpatient were within normal limits. After discontinuation of Zantrex-3™, the patient has experienced no further seizure activity.",

It is now understood that nicotine itself is not very harmful and nicotine replacement therapy products have been widely used as an aid to quit, reduce to quit or temporarily abstain from smoking for many years. The popularity of the unlicensed electronic cigarette has increased despite an unknown risk profile and sinus use in Sweden provides strong evidence in support of a harm reduction strategy. The regulatory environment around harm reduction has changed in the UK and is continuing to evolve across the globe. The need for more appealing, licensed nicotine products capable of competing with cigarettes sensorially, pharmacologically and behaviourally is considered by many to be the way forward. The significant positive impact on public health that could be gained from encouraging people to switch from cigarettes to licensed medicinal nicotine products cannot be ignored.",

L'extinction de cet effet par le retrait des contingences ou par l'administration d'un antagoniste confirme ce resultat. Toutefois, certaines etudes ont conclu a un pouvoir aversif de la nicotine. En effet, sous certaines conditions de choix, l'eau peut-etre preferee a la nicotine. La nicotine peut egalement servir de punisseur au meme titre qu'un choc electrique dans d'autres etudes. Ce travail apporte une vue globale des connaissances actuelles sur le pouvoir renforcant de la nicotine, indispensable a nos interrogations sur l'addiction au tabac chez l'homme.",

      "title": "Energy Drink vs. Coffee: The Effects on Levels of Alertness in Fatigued Individuals",
      "abstract": "Abstract : Fatigue due to sleep loss has been shown to lessen cognitive performance, slow visual recognition, and impair mathematical reasoning. This is especially of concern in the aviation community, as both civil and military aviation operations often impose excess fatigue, and pilots are required to execute various complex activities and react to potential emergencies at any time during a flight. A prevalent fatigue countermeasure is the use of caffeine as a stimulant. Caffeine is commonly found in coffee, soft drinks, tea, gum, supplements, and energy drinks. Multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of caffeine to increase alertness and improve cognitive performance in sleep-deprived individuals. Energy drinks contain caffeine and sugar, similar to a soft drink, but there are additional nonregulated ingredients that may be present. Manufacturers claim that the energy drinks can improve physical endurance and cognitive performance, but some health experts believe that any noticeable improvement is derived solely from the caffeine and sugar components. The purpose of this study was to lay the groundwork for investigating whether the additional components found in a common energy beverage will provide a higher degree of subjective and objective alertness in a fatigued individual over that provided by similar doses of caffeine and sugar alone. The study employed a double-blind, repeated measure design. Eight subjects were given subjective and objective cognitive testing prior to consuming Red Bull or coffee and 30 minutes after consuming the beverages in two sessions held 2 weeks apart. Data were analyzed using paired samples t-tests. The battery of tests given to the research participants demonstrated that both coffee and Red Bull have the ability to improve alertness in fatigued individuals. However, Red Bull had no statistically greater effects on objective cognitive performance in acutely fatigued individuals when compared to a control with the same amount of",

It is somewhat surprising, therefore, that serious cases of nicotine poisoning are not reported more frequently. The main reasons for the infrequency of serious poisoning are that the percentage of nicotine in tobacco is too small to make it easy to get a fatal dose from the ingestion of tobacco or the inhalation of its smoke, and that nausea and vomiting are early symptoms which ordinarily prevent further absorption of the drug. Fatal poisoning from tobacco, although rare, has been reported from smoking, from swallowing tobacco, from tobacco enemas, and from its use as a local application to the skin in favus.<sup>1</sup>The commercial insecticides that contain high percentages of nicotine are, of course, far more dangerous.

There is a consensus about adverse effects related to heavy consumption of potential toxic substances, but opinions about mild abuses remain blurred. Zero tolerance public health policies for alcohol or tobacco consumption during pregnancy are difficult to sustain for caregivers, very often embarrassed by anamnestic findings related to mild addictions. How to get this information, how relevant it is and what to do with that are essential questions to answer. For some of the patients, drug abuse is a compensation for psychological difficulties, for others, the use of illicit substance is directly linked to a psychiatric disorders. These difficulties as well as these disorders require correct identification. Communication about risks related to drug abuse is essential but parallel process including analysis of the emotions behind the substance consumption should be performed.",

The reward pathway is found at the very center of the brain. The use of an addictive substance brings about a strong sense of pleasure as the substance enters the bloodstream and brain. When drugs are used regularly, the reward pathway becomes intertwined with the drug effect. Addictive behaviors such as gambling, sex addiction, and even self-cutting, also engage the reward pathway by releasing dopamine. Meditation helps to rewire the reward pathway back to normal. Certain yoga focus meditations cause a release of dopamine to help clients experience enjoyment without drugs, a first step in unlinking the connection between addiction and the reward pathway. Mindfulness meditation can help detach from cravings by altering the pleasure-pain struggle. In addition, meditation lowers the physical discomforts.",

      "abstract": "Among the different behavioral criteria used to discriminate substance dependence (or drug addiction) from other non-disordered forms of drug use, drug intake escalation presents a number of unique features that makes it particularly suitable for modeling in nonhuman animals. This criterion has stood the passage of time despite major revisions of diagnostic systems, it is common to all known drugs of abuse and it can be readily and unambiguously operationalized in laboratory animals. Here I exhaustively review evidence showing that escalation to heavy consumption of different drugs (except perhaps nicotine) can be rapidly induced in the majority of individual animals (i.e., rats) by increased drug availability. Such an escalation of drug use is probably paralleled by an authentic escalation to drug addiction, as it is associated with the co-occurrence of other addiction-like changes (i.e., increased motivation for drug use; increased difficulty to abstain from drug use; decreased sensitivity to negative consequences). In addition, during escalation of drug intake, most individual animals become increasingly responsive to drug- and stress-primed, but apparently not cue-primed, reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction. Finally, following increased drug use, most individuals present selective cognitive dysfunctions (e.g., deficits in executive functions) that may contribute to the establishment and/or persistence of addiction. Thus, the study of individuals with escalating patterns of drug use should provide a unique and valid approach to investigate, experimentally, the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the progression to addiction.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine is a very popular compound widely available in various beverages. It is generally regarded as safe, but several lethal outcomes have been reported after large overdoses. A 21-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department (ED) after ingestion of approximately 100 caffeine tablets, each containing 200 mg, resulting in a total amount of about 20,000 mg of caffeine. She was very irritable and complained about nausea, vomiting, and headaches. While the initial electrocardio graphy (ECG) showed ventricular bigeminy, most of the patient`s symptoms were gone after supportive care with anti-emetics and benzodiazepine. The rhythm was converted to a sinus rhythm without anti-arrhythmics. Because caffeine tablets are unavailable in Korea, acute large-dose caffeine overdoses have been relatively rare. However, there is an increasing risk of caffeine exposure through highly concentrated “energy drinks” or caffeine tablets from purchases on-line. Thus, physicians should be prepared to deal with the severe toxic effects of an acute caffeine over-dose.",

      "abstract": "Smoking has become one of the critical factors endangering human health. Under increasing personal health threats, many smokers have tried to escape from this habit. For those who want to quit smoking completely, whether adopt abrupt cessation or gradual cessation has been a controversial topic for many years. Abrupt cessation refers to quit smoking abruptly, without any nicotine intaking in the cessation period. Gradual cessation refers to quit smoking gradually, lowering the nicotine intake through the cessation period. So far, in this field, many researchers have stood with the opinion supporting the abrupt cessation, saying that abrupt cessation is effective in reducing smoking behavior and the chance of relapse. This article reviews the existing papers, aiming to evaluate the supporting information on abrupt cessation and gradual cessation, and give out an overview of existing controversy. The result suggests that the effectiveness of abrupt cessation cannot be neglected. However, through the consideration of smokers' preferences, the severity of being addicted, and drug intervention, gradual cessation may play a more critical role.",

De acuerdo con el informe mundial sobre el consumo de drogas de la ONU de 2004, se estima que en el mundo cerca de 2.600 millones de personas lo consumen ya sea en forma ocasional, habitual, abusiva o adictiva. En Colombia, el programa presidencial RUMBOS estimo en 2001, que el 89.7% de los estudiantes universitarios eran consumidores habituales de alcohol etilico. Esta sustancia tambien es la mas utilizada en Colombia como sustancia de inicio para el consumo habitual de otras sustancias psicoactivas. El etanol cuando se consume en forma continuada y frecuente produce efectos adversos agudos y cronicos en la salud humana. En consumidores cronicos de alcohol, se han comprobado efectos adversos nutricionales, neurolo­gicos, hepaticos y teratogenicos. En intoxicacion aguda se pueden presentar alteraciones en el sistema nervioso central, gastroin­testinal, endocrino y en el equilibrio acido basico especialmente. El consumo de etanol tambien se ha asociado con la presentacion de varias alteraciones sociales como incremento en los indices de violencia intrafamiliar, violencia general, actos delictivos y accidentes de transito. Sus altos indices de consumo, su comprobado efecto toxico sobre la salud, sus repercusiones negativas sobre los roles sociales del individuo, unidos al hecho de ser una sustancia legal y socialmente aceptada, senalan el consumo incontrolado de bebidas alcoholicas como un verdadero problema de salud publica, sobre el cual es necesario llamar la atencion.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of premature death, and it is currently listed as a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Because of restrictive measures and widespread control policies, tobacco companies are now using aggressive marketing strategies in favor of smokeless tobacco, including electronic nicotine delivery systems, which are also known as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Although the regular use of these devices appears less hazardous than traditional cigarettes or other forms of smokeless tobacco, recent studies have shown that various potentially harmful substances, especially nicotine, ultraparticles, and volatile organic compounds, may be effectively inhaled or liberated in exhaled air during repeated e-cigarette puffing. This would enhance the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, which may predispose some users to increased risk of cardiovascular events, which may be further magnified by other potential adverse effects such as arrhythmias, increased respiratory, and flow respiratory resistance. Some cases of intoxication have also been described, wherein large amounts of nicotine and other harmful compounds may be effectively absorbed. As the use of e-cigarettes is continuously rising, and it is also considered a potentially effective method for smoking cessation, more focused research is urgently needed to definitely establish the cardiovascular safeness of these devices.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Once the state of dependence is recognized and a decision to carry on with drug use is taken, two things become acutely apparent to the drug user: she has to make sure she has a steady supply of drugs to ward off withdrawal, and she has to find the means to do this. Until this point, drug use had been perceived as a part of her life. Drugs had been consumed as and when they became available, and this availability had not been recognized as an essential part of her life. This is not to say that purchasing drugs and financing this had not already become a major part of her everyday life. Becoming physically dependent requires that substances have to be taken on a regular basis over a period of time (Zinberg, 1984). But recognition of the stage of dependence brought with it a simultaneous recognition of the importance of the other features of a drug lifestyle. In particular, two activities assume major importance: obtaining a supply of drugs and finding the means, usually financial, to make this possible.",

TreatmentDespite the availability of effective treatments, few people with bulimia nervosa seek help.One study found that only 1 in 10 people with the condition are in treatment. 1 Treatments that are likely to workAntidepressants Antidepressants can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.There is not enough evidence on how long the benefits last or for comparing the effects of different classes of antidepressants.Antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy are equally effective for bulimia nervosa, though dropout rates are higher with antidepressants, probably due to their side effects.For information on drug doses, see www.besttreatments.org/bulimianervosa. Cognitive behaviour therapyAs with antidepressants, cognitive behaviour therapy can reduce binge eating and purging, and improve depressive symptoms and attitude towards food.It may be preferable to medication in patients who are sensitive to, or wish to avoid, side effects of medication.Cognitive behaviour therapy and other psychological treatments seem to be equally good at treating binge eating, although cognitive behaviour therapy is better at improving depression scores.There is some evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy has long term benefits in treating bulimia, but there is insufficient evidence about patients' characteristics that predict response.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The term ‘stimulant’ refers to a class of drugs that increase psychophysiological arousal. From the viewpoint of prevention, it is more useful to look primarily at the social consequences and functions of stimulants. Every society has a documented use of stimulants. When planning interventions the dynamics of use must be placed in the foreground. Stimulant epidemics, like problematic stimulant users, have a natural tendency to burn themselves out. Different types of stimulants may differ in their origins, but their epidemiological consequences and use functions tend to be similar. Implications for prevention can be drawn from the characteristics of stimulant use epidemics. Users at risk for socially unacceptable patterns should be targeted for prevention efforts. Mass media campaigns that single out stimulants should be avoided. Much of the harm associated with stimulants is a consequence of life‐styles characterized by polydrug use and unhealthy practices. Prevention should be timed to the appropriate period of the epidemic. Interventions useful at period I will not work at period 2. The recommendations of the WHO Advisory Group on the Adverse Effects of Cocaine and Coca provide a good model for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention for all forms of stimulant misuse. Stimulant prevention must be creative in finding ways of encouraging the movements of the drug to the periphery of users’lives.",

With this recent technological development and wide range of constituents in various products, putative adverse effects on the brain and body have been largely unexplored. Here, we review current evidence linking electronic nicotine cigarette use with potential health consequences and provide evidence supporting an association between drug use and depression in humans. We also examine the biological effects of individual constituents in electronic cigarette aerosols, which include labeled ingredients, such as propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine, and flavorants, as well as unlabeled ingredients found in the aerosols, such as carbonyls and heavy metals. Lastly, we examine the effects of electronic cigarette use on endogenous metabolism via changes in cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can thereby impact therapeutic outcomes. While the current evidence offers insight into the potential effects of electronic cigarette use on biological processes, further studies are necessary to determine the long-term clinical relevance of aerosol inhalation.",

      "abstract": "While there is a large volume of research on alcohol misuse, dependence and withdrawal, the pharmacologic solutions are not as directly evident as this amount may suggest. There are widespread cultural determinants as to what constitutes alcohol misuse though the definitions for dependence are much clearer. Yet we do not have good solid pharmacologic treatments to prevent or decrease alcohol usage in the alcohol-dependent individual, though results from the recent COMBINE study suggest a more prominent and effective role for naltrexone in conjunction with medical management. Acamprosate did not fare as well in this trial even though it has been approved for alcohol dependence, and questions of heterogeneity among patient populations might explain conflicting findings. The effectiveness of disulfiram appears to rely heavily upon the patient's determination to remain abstinent. Anticonvulsants may have a role here, but more data is needed. Benzodiazepines remain the gold standard for treatment of symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, while a number of studies also support the use of some anticonvulsant drugs in assisting with withdrawal, especially in cases of mild-to-moderate severity.",

      "abstract": "Figure: Cannabis, CHS, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndromeFigureI have seen at least one case of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) every other shift I have worked for the past year. That's one case every other day, yet the majority of Americans have no idea Cannabis can make them sick. “No, it's not the pot. I've been smoking it for years, and it's never made me throw up.” “But there's a medical dispensary right down the street from me. Doctors are giving it to everyone.” “Marijuana doesn't make you vomit; it stops nausea and makes you hungry.” I hear a statement like this at least once a week. Unfortunately, emergency physicians are seeing an explosion of CHS cases as the psychoactive substance is assimilated into mainstream culture and made widely available. Patients who use marijuana chronically come in with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. These patients are often critically ill, requiring multiple liters of IV fluid and sometimes even admission. Those of us tasked with treating the negative sequela of Cannabis are frustrated by how “safe” everyone believes the drug to be. The reality is that the THC concentration in marijuana today is completely unregulated. Libby Stuyt, MD, an addiction psychiatrist in Colorado, wrote an eye-opening article in which she explained the shocking escalation of THC concentrations: “When Colorado legalized marijuana for medical use in 2000, the highest concentration of THC in the plant was 5% and there were no concentrated products.... Over the last 20 years, without any state governmental regulation to limit potency, the industry has dramatically increased the concentration of THC to where the average in the plant is now 18.8%. They have also created a range of concentrates with the average THC potency of 69.4%, some up to 95%. “While there is evidence that components of marijuana can be beneficial for some medical conditions, the research supporting this has been done with THC concentrations less than 10% in the smoked plant. There is no validated research on the 18%-95% THC products available in dispensaries indicating they are efficacious for anything medical or safe for anyone.” (MedPage Today. Feb. 1, 2021; https://bit.ly/3qqniRC.) Not a Harmless Pleasure The frightening lack of regulations on marijuana production and sales means patients do not know the dose of THC they are getting or what other substances are mixed in. Illicitly made marijuana can be laced with K2, fentanyl, and embalming fluid. This is anything but safe. Yet many of my patients who come in retching from CHS have a hard time accepting that marijuana is to blame. When I tell them that the lisinopril they have been on for years is the likely culprit behind their angioedema, most immediately ask me for a new antihypertensive. When a patient's mindset is, “Weed makes me feel good,” we physicians encounter more cognitive bias when it comes to educating them that Cannabis can be just as toxic. It's hard to convince someone to attempt the definitive treatment for cannabinoid hyperemesis—stopping Cannabis use—when they are incredulous that their hyperemesis is cannabinoid-induced in the first place. Consistent publicity about the adverse health effects of marijuana would fight this misconception. The Cannabis industry has been allowed to label concentrated THC products as medical, so the public tends to underestimate or even completely ignore the risks. Marijuana's role in helping nausea in cancer patients is well publicized, but CHS is relatively unknown. Most of the limited information that exists for lay people about CHS describes the condition as rare. I can assure you it is not as rare as people are led to believe, especially after the number of CHS cases I've seen over the past year since the double whammy of the pandemic and widespread legalization. We need more aggressive public education about CHS and the other dangers of marijuana. Our youth learn in school about the relative ethanol concentration of various alcohols and the risks of consumption, but marijuana education is far less comprehensive. I asked my high school-aged sons what they learned about marijuana in health class. They said their substance use units centered around alcohol and tobacco, with some education on heroin and cocaine. Their takeaway about marijuana is that it's a gateway drug. They did not learn that marijuana can contain different concentrations of THC. There was little if any discussion of the risk of addiction, effects on cognition and brain development, risks of motor vehicle crashes, or CHS. We need more education in our public schools to emphasize that marijuana is not a harmless pleasure. Profit over Health We also need health warnings and appropriate cautionary labeling from the marijuana industry itself. Hopefully we've learned a lesson or two from Big Tobacco about what we might expect from for-profit manufacturers and dispensaries if they aren't held accountable. I worked for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in the 1990s—30 years after cigarettes were known to cause cancer—to get research experience while I was pre-med. The American Medical Association around that time asked the company to pull their Joe Camel campaign after a study showed that nearly as many children by age 6 could correctly associate Joe Camel with cigarettes as could link the Disney logo with Mickey Mouse. Don't think the budding Cannabis industry will not similarly prioritize profit over public health if we don't hold them responsible. Big Weed would love for the public to believe that marijuana is as safe as their morning cup of coffee and stay conveniently unaware of CHS. We EPs see firsthand how incapacitating and miserable CHS can be, and that vantage point gives us the opportunity for public and bedside education to correct the lack of awareness about this illness and other health risks of marijuana. We can help stop the impending spike in CHS cases by educating one patient at a time and our communities. We should also raise our collective concern about marijuana's health risks to those responsible for the production, sale, and distribution of Cannabis. We should be pushing for cautionary labels and limiting excessive concentrations. Let's do better than our predecessors did against the health threat of tobacco. We can't let decades go by between realizing the dangers of widespread consumption and taking action. If we want our patients to know that CHS exists, we should be pushing for cautionary labels and more extensive education now. Share this article on Twitter and Facebook.

Atualmente, apesar dos rigores da lei, o crack tornou-se uma epidemia. As politicas publicas apresentadas solucionar o referido problema tem se mostrado ineficazes e insuficientes. E, o direito penal apresenta-se nesse cenario como algo inutil e desprovido de mecanismos capazes de coibirem o trafico e o abuso da droga por parte dos usuarios. O crack possui uma particularidade que a diferencia da maioria das drogas: seu efeito e curto. Diante do curto periodo de efeito do crack, surge no usuario o desejo incontrolavel de querer sempre mais uma dose maior. As acoes ilicitas praticadas por aqueles que sao usuarios de crack, ocorrem motivadas pelo uso dessa droga. O crack e visto como uma droga que possui um poder avassalador, superando os entorpecentes, transformando o seu usuario num dependente periculoso, capaz de realizar qualquer coisa para manter o vicio. Como o vicio do crack nao possui controle, o usuario desfaz de tudo que possui para comprar a droga. Em alguns casos, troca o que possui pela droga. E, quando nao encontra mais nada em casa que pertenca a si ou a familia, para vender ou trocar por crack, passa a roubar para manter o vicio. Na maioria das vezes, sem dinheiro e sem o produto dos roubos, dificultados pela repressao, os usuarios de crack comecam a se endividarem nas 'boca', tornando-se escravos do crime organizado. O presente trabalho, de natureza bibliografica, teve por objetivo, abordar a dependencia quimica do crack como gerador da criminalidade no âmbito patrimonial. Palavras-chave . Crack.

      "abstract": "Smoking and other forms of tobacco use are widely considered to represent a form of addiction to nicotine. Moreover, a nicotine withdrawal syndrome contributes significantly to the high relapse rate upon cessation. Nicotine exerts its effects through activation of nicotinic receptors, and its addictive properties appear to be mediated largely through stimulation of monoaminergic pathways in the brain. This might also explain the high prevalence of smoking in several psychiatric disorders. Nicotine replacement still represents our main drug therapy in smoking cessation programmes, but recent experimental findings may lead to the introduction of novel pharmacological treatments.",

      "abstract": "Various fitness drinks under the designation of \"energy or power drinks\" or \"brain or athletic food\" are very popular among young people. For those entrusted with rendering expert opinions that poses the question of whether consumption of these beverages is of any importance when a person's ability to drive or mental capacity has to be assessed, especially in combination with alcoholic beverages imbibed at the same time. In the case discussed here-both the 20-year-old car driver and his passenger suffered not inconsiderable injuries-an alcohol concentration of 1.2 per mille was found at the time a blood sample was taken. Furthermore, a caffeine content of 1.5 micrograms/ml was noted. A value also reached after drinking a cup of filter coffee. In contrast, values of 2 to 10 micrograms/ml are reached when caffeine is used for therapeutic purposes. Values of more than 15 micrograms/ml are considered toxic. The measured caffeine content was thus fully insignificant. The same also applies to the \"active ingredients\" (taurine, glucuronolactone) contained in the beverage \"Red Bull\". Another assumption that, namely, the effect of alcohol can be offset by such beverages could lead to a situation in which young people incorrectly assess their ability to drive after imbibing alcohol and fitness drinks. That is naturally given support by corresponding tributes by the manufacturers (\"improves performance\", \"invigorates the mind and body\").",

Cancer of the larynx is also related to both alcohol and tobacco, but the role of alcohol appears only when exposure to tobacco is also present.

      "title": "A Brief Analysis About the Drug Addiction by Youths in India",
      "abstract": "Abstract: People have been taking the drug in various forms for many years for enjoyment, relaxation, sleeping, stimulation, or another reason. In the starting, people takes the drug for taste and alter the consciousness, behavior, mood, and thoughts but he/she becomes habitual and dependent on any substance use disorder such as alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin, amphetamines, or illegal drugs. As per my thoughts and watching surroundings, if you ask a drug intake person “how do you become a drug addictive”? Most people will answer this “they started taking the drug in their friend circle, at relatives home or with relationship partner”. The first time they take it for taste or due to forcing by someone but after some time this becomes a habit. Peer pressure can fall you in this black world. Also, if someone has family history of addiction then he/she may chance to catch this addiction and make habitual others as well. So good friend circle really matters. Drugs such as heroin and marijuana are structured in the same way as chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are produced naturally by the human brain. As a result of this similarity, the drugs can fool the receptors of human brain and activate the nerve cells in such a way that they send some abnormal messages. In case of drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine, the nerve cells get activated and they release extraordinarily large volumes of neurotransmitters. They are also capable of preventing the brain from recycling these chemicals in a normal manner. A normal level of production is necessary in order to end the signal between neurons.

      "title": "Part II HEALTH RISKS: THE DOWNSIDE OF GETTING HIGH",
      "abstract": "As an herbal remedy, cannabis can lift your mood and can treat a long list of ailments. But the way that most of us take a hit of pot needlessly takes a hit on our health. It is high time for health-conscious cannabis consumers to learn a new way of smoking that reduces its risks. In Mindful Marijuana Smoking, Mark Mathew Braunstein offers sound advice on every phase of the cannabis smoking experience, presenting health tips based on solid science. Whether with rolling papers, hand pipes, waterpipes, or herbal vaporizers, each method of cannabinoid delivery has both risks and rewards. Chapters are devoted to each method so that you can learn how to maximize their benefits and reduce their hazards, as well as how to protect your health even before you take a puff. And once you’ve inhaled the smoke, this book assures you that you don’t need to hold your breath to reap all the benefits of cannabis.",

      "title": "A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Multidimensional Approach on Awareness regarding Tobacco Chewing and Its Health Risk among Adolescent Boys Aged between 14 - 18 Years in Selected Schools of Rural Area of Indore District (M. P.)",
      "abstract": "In India, tobacco is used in a variety of forms such as smoking, chewing, local applications, drinking and gargling, leading to detrimental health effects such as increased incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and cancer, in addition to detrimental reproductive outcomes, dental and oral diseases. Tobacco use, in any form, is more popular in lower socio -economic groups. Betel -quid chewing-a mixture of areca nut, slaked lime, catechu, other spices and condiments rapped in a betel leaf-is a popular, socially accepted, ancient custom and the introduction of tobacco reinforced this practice. Chewing products are kept all day and sometimes even all night in the buccal sulcus or pouch; usually in the anterior part of the mouth in populations from North India, and in the posterior part among South Indians, colouring the mouth in red. The vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors (less than 18 years) and increasing the price of tobacco products through higher taxes, banning tobacco advertising and ensuringsmoke -free environments are crucial.Globally, at least 1 in 10 adolescents aged 13-15 years uses tobacco, although there are areas where this figure is much higher.",

      "title": "The Case for Cannabis",
      "abstract": "FigureFigureI routinely meet people who ask why anyone needs a Cannabis doctor. They say: Don't you just tell patients to take a puff and stop when they are too high? Anyone over age 21 (in recreationally legal states) can just pick up some pot at a local dispensary, so why get a physician involved? The answer is simple: Cannabis is as complex as the ICD-10 codes. About 90 percent of my patients don't smoke Cannabis products. They use ratio oil tinctures and edibles, and the dosages need to be precise to avoid ED visits due to accidental overdose, panic attacks, and the like. About 10 percent use one product, but the majority use two or three. About 10 percent use CBD only. Patients will spend $50-$200 a month on medication. If any of these numbers are surprising to you, remember that these are not recreational uses. People who use recreationally can spend $20 every month or two (or more) depending on their use, and they tend to stick to one product. My patients are more likely to be women, older, and at the end of life. These are our most vulnerable patients, and they should be treated with caution and respect, not like they are going to a local drug dealer. Pediatric patients in every state, even those with legal recreational use, must seek a clinician's advice and recommendation to use Cannabis medications. This includes those seeking palliative care, being treated for cancer, and with chronic illnesses such as cerebral palsy and autism. Without these recommendations, children are at risk for child protective services being called and removing them from their home, a scary situation for these beloved children who are our most vulnerable patients. They also need more mindful discussions, with weight-based dosing and monitoring of effects and side effects. After all, we are discussing a potentially misused mind-affecting medication. These medications are also typically dosed as oil tinctures in the range of 0.1-1 ml BID-TID. Real-life Patients A patient of mine, a 2-year-old with cancer, was undergoing chemotherapy using CBD and THC for pain control, and was able to avoid opioids and a nasogastric tube for feedings. This patient also tolerated chemo better with treatment. Another patient, a 13-year-old who had been sexually molested at age 6, was having difficulty sleeping, and his 21-year-old brother was giving him 50 mg THC capsules (about 10 times the recreational dose for an adult) to help him sleep at night. Within a week or two, I was able to get him down to 2-4 mg THC-CBD combination oil, and he is sleeping better at night and able to discuss therapy. This case was particularly weighted on the education of the parent and child. Individuals have always read something on the internet, and our jobs as clinicians is to balance patient interpretation with internet product advertising, which has been unmonitored for too long. Adult patients have chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, cancer, and many other conditions that can result in Cannabis overuse and ED visits; these patients should be evaluated by a Cannabis specialist. The options are vast—CBD or THC only, CBD:THC ratio, smoke, vape, oil tincture, edible, suppository, and G/NG tube. The equivalent of not providing guidance would be to send people to the store and tell them to pick whatever variety of opioids (not heroin) that they thought would be helpful to them, in whatever quantity, dosage, and frequency. Another patient of mine was a 27-year-old man with a history of depression and anxiety who was taking two or three psychiatric medications. Those led to a 40-pound weight gain, which resulted in high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and continued poor sleep. He had previously tried using Cannabis products, but was never able to get it right. I now have him using 2-4 mg of THC-CBD oil at bedtime, and we are decreasing his benzodiazepines. Given the inability to stop benzodiazepines cold turkey because of withdrawal seizures and the importance of slowly adjusting up THC-CBD dosages, working with a physician provides the opportunity to get the best outcome. This process can occasionally take a few months and multiple appointments. Older Patients Older patients seek help for dementia, neurodegenerative diseases, anxiety, depression, pain, palliative care, arthritis, and much more. Most of these patients are on four or more medications. Combine those with a Cannabis medication that can cause dizziness, falls, blood pressure drops, and negative interactions with other medications, and you can see the importance of discussing usage with a specialist. Another patient, a legally blind man in his 80s who was in a board and care, has severe arthritis, diabetes, and chronic pain and is hearing impaired. Using an oil tincture was out of the question because he couldn't see the lines on the oil dropper to dose accurately. Edibles were difficult because of their sugar content. The odorless, noncombustible option was important given his living situation. None of the patients who sees a Cannabis physician in a recreationally legal marketplace does so because they just want to get high; they can do that without a high price tag. They all see physicians for the same reason they would see another specialist—to get assistance in a difficult situation. I recall not too long ago that the joke about neurology was that it was a lot of training to learn how to prescribe aspirin for strokes. That is obviously a silly statement, and neurologists help patients in so many more ways. Cannabis clinicians do the same. The next time you see a patient with an accidental Cannabis overdose or presumed cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, consider referring to your local Cannabis specialist to try to break the cycle and get the patient some much needed help.",

Hence, people are fond of using herbal products of their choice to treat their own ailments or anyone else. As majority of the population are not aware of herbal toxicity concept, the use of formulated single or combined medicinal and/or nutritional plant extracts or isolated compounds to treat chronic diseases are increasingly popular due to the widespread concerns regarding the adverse effects of pharmaceutical drugs. Awareness from the scientific community to bring society to its senses regarding the safety issue of a herbal product is rare. Garcinia gummi-gutta (more popularly known by the synonym Garcinia cambogia in commercial preparations), belonging to the family of Clusiaceae (alt. Guttiferae) is a popularly consumed weight-loss nutraceutical. This review aims to highlight the possible adverse effects of G. cambogia. For the said purpose, 147 articles were collected from PubMed, Web of Science and Google scholar. Literature review revealed a plethora of beneficial actions. Investigational outcomes and clinical evidences hint the possible adverse effects likely to be linked with the use of G. cambogia. However, the use of G. cambogia as an anti-obesity agent is advisable as long as the therapeutic value outweighs the adverse effect.",

The tobacco plant has a thick, hairy stem and large, simple leaves which are oval in shape. The tobacco plant produces white, cream, pink or red flowers which grow in large clusters, are tubular in appearance and can reach 3.5-5.5 cm (1,25-2 in) in length. Tobacco may reach 1.2-1.8 m (4-6 ft) in height, Tobacco is one of the most widely abused substances in the world. It is highly addictive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that tobacco causes 6 million deaths per year. This makes tobacco the leading cause of preventable death, Nicotine is the main addictive chemical in tobacco. It causes a rush of adrenaline when absorbed in the bloodstream or inhaled via cigarette smoke. Nicotine also triggers an increase in dopamine. This is sometimes referred to as the brain’s “happy” chemical. \r\n\r\nObjectives: The main goal of this expert system is to get the appropriate diagnosis of disease. \r\n\r\nMethods: In this paper the design of the proposed Expert System which was produced to help Doctor in diagnosing many of the tobacco diseases such as: Damping off, Frog eye leaf spot, Leaf blight / black shank, Anthracnose, Sore shin, Fusarium wilt, Brown spot, Tobacco mosaic disease, Tobacco ring spot disease, Cucumber mosaic disease, Tobacco leaf curl disease. The proposed expert system presents an overview about tobacco diseases are given, the cause of diseases are outlined. CLIPS and Delphi languages were used for designing and implementing the proposed expert system. \r\n\r\nResults: The proposed tobacco diseases diagnosis expert system was evaluated by engineering students and found to be positive.",

Simultaneously, we can observe an increase in the availability of dietary services, reduction diets or various types of low-calorie food. What are the reasons for that? So far obesity and its consequences have been described in terms of somatic diseases. However, the psychological issue was ignored. Currently, we can observe a significant increase in the researcher’s interest in the psychological sphere of obese people. Excessive weight cannot be seen only as a consequence of the increased calorie intake. It is also the result of trained mechanisms of coping with stress, anxiety disorders, or as a result of low self-esteem and effectiveness. Probably people function in such a way because the word has changed its function. It does not just provide food and energy. It has become a way of expressing feelings, spending time and coping with emotions. Eating meals fits in many aspects of human functioning, including a family aspect, a business aspect or a social one. High availability of food and the omnipresence of restaurants contribute to the fact that people easier grab meals, regardless of whether they need them or not. In some cases food is a way to get rid of boredom or the way of spending time. Certain features of temperament and personality are characteristic for obese people. In addition, recently more and more psychiatric disorders associated with obesity have been distinguished. Available diagnostic methods and knowledge on the mechanisms of these anomalies allow to their differentiation. We can distinguish the following disorders: binge eating disorder, night eating syndrome, stress eating, sleep eating disorders and others.",

      "abstract": "En Espana, el consumo de alcohol se ha asociado tradicionalmente a la poblacion adulta y se ha caracterizado por la regularidad de su uso, la vinculacion a la dieta y a los acontecimientos sociales. Sin embargo, los ultimos informes del Observatorio Espanol sobre Drogas han destacado la emergencia de un nuevo patron de consumo de alcohol con una gran prevalencia entre adolescentes y jovenes adultos. Esta forma de consumir se caracteriza por la ingesta de grandes cantidades de alcohol en cortos espacios de tiempo, principalmente en fin de semana, que suele llevar a la embriaguez. La literatura anglosajona denomina mayoritariamente a este patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol binge drinking (BD) o heavy episodic drinking (HED).\nEstudios realizados recientemente mediante modelos animales apuntan a una mayor vulnerabilidad del cerebro adolescente a los efectos neurotoxicos del alcohol, debido a la importante reestructuracion estructural y funcional que sufre el cerebro durante esta etapa, que en humanos abarca la segunda decada de la vida. Ademas, parece que el patron de consumo BD puede resultar significativamente mas danino para el cerebro que el consumo regular de alcohol.\n Sin embargo, a pesar de estos preocupantes datos y de la alta prevalencia del patron BD, el estudio de las posibles consecuencias neuropsicologicas asociadas a este modo de consumo es todavia escaso, no existiendo resultados concluyentes al respecto.\n El presente estudio tiene por objetivo principal determinar las consecuencias neuropsicologicas asociadas al patron de consumo BD en estudiantes universitarios de primer ano de carrera. Para ello, administramos una amplia bateria de pruebas neuropsicologicas que nos han permitido valorar diferentes funciones cognitivas. Los resultados muestran que los jovenes BD presentan, en relacion con sus pares No BD, un menor rendimiento en tarea que impliquen: memoria de trabajo verbal, memoria declarativa episodica verbal (tanto de forma inmediata como demorado) y funcionamiento ejecutivo (mayor susceptibilidad a la interferencia proactiva, menor flexibilidad cognitiva, y mayores dificultades de planificacion). Asimismo, tambien se ha comprobado que con una historia de consumo breve (media de cuatro anos), la vulnerabilidad a los efectos neurotoxicos del alcohol entre jovenes con patron de consumo intensivo de alcohol es semejante para ambos sexos.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, caffeine is one of the most commonly consumed substances, which presents in many plants and products. It has both positive and negative effects on the human body, and its activity concerns a variety of systems including the central nervous system, immune system, digestive system, respiratory system, urinary tract, etc. These effects are dependent on quantity, the type of product in which caffeine is contained, and also on the individual differences among people (sex, age, diet etc.). The main aim of this review was to collect, present, and analyze the available information including the latest discoveries on the impact of caffeine on human health and the functioning of human body systems, taking into account the role of caffeine in individual disease entities. We present both the positive and negative sides of caffeine consumption and the healing properties of this purine alkaloid in diseases such as asthma, Parkinson's disease, and others, not forgetting about the negative effects of excess caffeine (e.g., in people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly). In summary, we can conclude, however, that caffeine has a multi-directional influence on various organs of the human body, and because of its anti-oxidative properties, it was, and still is, an interesting topic for research studies including those aimed at developing new therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Successful Multiorgan Donation From a Brain-dead Donor Following Liquid Nicotine Voluntary Intoxication: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The electronic cigarette was invented in 2003 by Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, as an alternative source of nicotine to traditional tobacco products and coincided with the development of some nicotine replacement therapies. From the beginning of 2004, it spread widely on Western European and American markets and subsequently worldwide. Instead of burning tobacco leaves, electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that aerosolize liquid nicotine by heating a solution that contains different proportions of nicotine, glycerol, propylene glycol, and flavoring agents.1 Nicotine is a hazardous, highly toxic, and very addictive substance extracted from tobacco leaves. Exposure to elevated doses of nicotine may cause acute intoxication and eventually acute respiratory and cardiovascular failure, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death. Cases of nicotine intoxication after conventional cigarette exposure, transdermal nicotine patches, or tobacco leaves have been reported. Yet, as electronic cigarette use increases, so has the number of both accidental and voluntary liquid nicotine intoxications. Accidental or unintentional intoxication involves mainly children under 10 y of age, whereas that of older patients is most likely voluntary and considered a suicide attempt.1-4 We present a case of multiorgan donation from a brain-dead donor admitted to our unit after resuscitation from cardiorespiratory arrest due to a voluntary intake of liquid nicotine with an autolytic aim. CASE DESCRIPTION A 26-y-old male individual was found unconscious by his parents on the floor of his room. He had a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder from childhood, had given up cannabis, cocaine, and metilenedioximethanphetamine abuse, and had survived several suicide attempts, the last of which consisted of jumping from a fifth floor and resulted in L2 spinal cord injury, spastic syndrome, neurogenic bladder, and bowel dysfunction. He was under treatment with venlafaxine, mirtazapine, lorazepam, gabapentin, aripiprazole, levetiracetam, and baclofen. Upon arrival of the emergency medical service, the patient was in cardiorespiratory arrest, so advanced cardiac life support maneuvers were initiated and performed for 40 minutes. When asked, his parents reported finding an empty 50 mL bottle of liquid nicotine beside him but denied a smoking or vaping habit. After spontaneous circulation was restored, he was transferred to the hospital. On arrival, his vital signs were as follow: blood pressure: 140/70 mm Hg; heart rate: 90 beats/min; temperature: 37 °C; respiratory rate (on mechanical ventilation): 20 breaths/min; arterial blood gas analysis (sample drawn on arrival at the emergency department): pH: 6.77; Pco2: 101 mm Hg; Po2: 28.5 mm Hg; HCO3: 6.6 mmol/L; EB: –26.1 mmol/L; satO2: 19.3%. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he was unresponsive, had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, fixed and dilated pupils, and abolished brainstem reflexes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests were as follow: leucocytes: 17.000/mm3, hemoglobin: 14.5 g/dL; platelets and coagulation tests were normal; serum creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase: 187 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase: 133; amylase: 160 U/L; and creatine kinase: 193 U/L. Arterial blood gas analysis after 6 h on mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen: pH: 7.37; Po2: 177 mm Hg; Pco2: 32.5 mm Hg; HCO3: 32.5 mmol/L; satO2: 100%. The electrocardiogram showed a regular sinus rhythm with a rate of 100/min and no abnormalities despite the long-lasting resuscitation maneuvers. Urine drug screening was positive for tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines, while urine sediment examination was normal. On admittance, a urine sample was obtained for testing the cotinine (nicotine metabolite) level and sent to the Reference Laboratory. The ELISA result was >2000 ng/mL (normal value <500 ng/mL). A few h after admittance, a diagnosis of clinical brain death was established through complete and protocolized neurological examination and then confirmed by electroencephalography, which showed a plain and unresponsive to pain 30-minute recording. The cause of death was hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy caused by prolonged cardiorespiratory arrest due to nicotine intoxication. In the abdominal echography, the liver was hyperechogenic with mild to moderate steatosis; both kidneys were normal, with good corticomedullary differentiation, and their length was 11.5 cm (on the long axis). Echocardiography showed a nondilated left ventricle, normal wall thickness, normal global systolic function (ejection fraction over 70%) without any altered segmental wall function and normal atria; the valves had a normal function and morphology, as well as the pericardium. The transplant coordinator was contacted. Family and judicial authorization for organ donation was requested (the latter is compulsory in Spain for violent deaths). The patient was proposed as a multiorgan donor, including heart, kidneys, and pancreas. The liver was discarded due to analytic and echographic disturbances. The Spanish National Transplant Organization organized the distribution of the organs according to a protocolized schedule. Organ retrieval surgery was uneventful. The heart recipient was a 60-y-old male individual, with a recent history of coronary artery disease who had suffered acute coronary syndrome followed by cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular rupture. He was placed on the waiting list as a code 0 patient and received a heart transplant on the sixth d, with a cold ischemia time of 6 h and 100 minutes on an extracorporeal pump. He was discharged from the ICU to the general ward on postoperative d 6 and discharged 9 d later. He presented some infectious complications in the follow-up, mainly cytomegalovirus pneumonia and a Stenotrophomonas maltophilia urinary infection, with a favorable outcome after admittance to the ICU. Evolution was then uneventful, and no complication was subsequently reported. One y after transplantation, he underwent coronarography, and the result was normal. The pancreas and left kidney were transplanted to a 30-y-old female individual, with type 1 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, and bad metabolic control, with dialysis treatment initiated 3 y and 19 d earlier. She spent 14 mo and 16 d on the waiting list. After receiving her double organ transplant (left kidney and pancreas), both grafts showed adequate function on the first postoperative d, and she was discharged on postoperative d 14. The plasma creatinine level was 1.01 mg/dL upon discharge and 1.2 mg/dL 1 y after transplantation with a full metabolic recovery. The right kidney was transplanted to a 26-y-old female individual, with IgA nephropathy, with dialysis treatment initiated 3 y, 11 mo, and 25 d earlier. The right kidney of the donor was transplanted to the left side of the recipient. Adequate graft function was confirmed in the operating theater as urine output started by the end of surgery. She had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative d 13 with a plasma creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. One y later, her plasma creatinine level was 1 mg/dL. DISCUSSION The popularity of e-cigarettes has increased since their commercialization; the reports of liquid nicotine intoxication, both accidental and voluntary as suicide attempts, have become more and more frequent, given the wide availability of e-liquids containing highly concentrated nicotine. The most frequent symptoms are nausea, vomiting, agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, headache, and altered mental status; higher doses of nicotine intoxication lead to severe tachycardia and arrhythmias, seizures, acute hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, cardiovascular collapse, and cardiac arrest.2-6 Because no specific antidote is available, the appropriate treatment is cardiopulmonary support in the ICU. The most frequent cause of death after nicotine intoxication is related to cardiac events, though acute cerebral pathology cannot be excluded. The actual lethal dose of nicotine is unknown; after oral ingestion, nicotine is absorbed and quickly metabolized by the liver into its inactive metabolites, the most stable and abundant of which is cotinine. Due to short half-life of nicotine (2–3 h), levels of cotinine concentration are frequently used as a surrogate marker of nicotine intoxication levels. Despite the high toxicity of a nicotine overdose, we have documented a case of successful multiorgan donation, including kidneys, pancreas, and heart from a brain-dead donor after a lethal nicotine intoxication and successful resuscitation from a cardiorespiratory arrest. This appears to be the first case of multiorgan donation following liquid nicotine intoxication reported in the literature so far. In 2017, Räsänen et al7 reported a case of kidney donation after brain death caused by a subcutaneous nicotine overdose in an attempted suicide. The patient was a 29-y-old woman with a history of severe depression and obesity who subcutaneously injected 10 mL of liquid nicotine after an intake of alcohol and diazepam. She was taken to hospital, still conscious but anxious on admission. In the emergency department, she had seizures followed by cardiorespiratory arrest. She was successfully resuscitated and admitted to the ICU, where she experienced an unfavorable course and eventually brain death. She was accepted as a kidney donor resulting in 2 successful transplantations: 2 women, aged 39 and 43 y, both with diabetic nephropathy as the cause of their end-stage renal disease. Both had an uneventful postoperative recovery and were discharged on postoperative d 9. On their follow-up, both were doing well, with normal plasma creatinine levels. In our case, the liver was discarded for transplantation due to altered aminotransferases, hyperechoic texture on ultrasonography in addition to the fact that the liver is the organ responsible for high-dose nicotine metabolism. Kidneys and pancreas were accepted for transplantation after confirming adequate laboratory tests and echographic data. To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature on renal failure after a nicotine overdose. After being transplanted, both kidneys and pancreas started to function within the first few h; dialysis was unnecessary and good function of the kidneys was present in the follow-up 1 y later. Regarding the heart, the decision to transplant was supported by the optimal electrocardiographic and echocardiographic record, the lack of elevated enzymes, and the hemodynamic stability of the donor after brain death, although the recent event of cardiac arrest and resuscitation maneuvers were an issue to be considered. As previously mentioned, heart transplantation was successful, and the recipient was doing well in his 1-y follow-up. The shortage of organs for transplantation has led transplant teams to consider brain-dead patients after fatal intoxications as potential candidates for donation. There is a growing number of cases in the literature reporting acceptable outcomes of organ procuring and transplant, most of them published as isolated cases. Successful kidney transplants have been documented from brain-dead donors after insulin or carbamazepine intoxication.8 Organ procurement after carbon monoxide intoxication has been discouraged, but successful multiorgan transplants have been reported, and an absolute contraindication is no longer accepted.9,10 Regarding illicit drug intoxications leading to brain death, there is an increase in the number of such patients recruited for organ donation. Solid organs transplanted after cocaine-related death do not show a worse outcome than those from noncocaine users, with some issues regarding heart transplant.10 Similarly, posttransplant survival of opioid-intoxicated donor hearts and lungs is similar to that from nonintoxicated donors.11,12 Even when dealing with brain-dead donors after ingestion of toxic substances mainly metabolized by the liver as, for instance, ethylene glycol or brodifacoum, a rodenticide with a potent anticoagulant effect, good graft outcome and acceptable recipient survival have been reported in the literature. Liver biopsy, hemodialysis to accelerate toxic clearance, and verification of the absence of the toxic substance in blood samples are the suggested strategies to optimize results.13-15 Liquid nicotine is a widely available, increasingly popular, and insufficiently regulated substance. Attention should be paid to the potential lethal risk of liquid nicotine intoxication, and efforts should be made to devise more thorough surveillance and avoid such unfortunate events. In case of lethal nicotine intoxication, multiorgan retrieval for donation may be considered, bearing in mind the recommendation of measuring nicotine metabolites in blood samples or even undertaking donor liver biopsy before performing the procedure.",

Even a single alcoholic beverage will interfere with procedural memory (for example, driving) and episodic memory (for example, remembering new facts and events of your life). Drinking alcohol will interfere with your retention of information you learned earlier in the day—and earlier in the week. As an adult, consuming one alcoholic beverage each day should not permanently damage your brain, but there also is no reason to drink in an effort to improve your brain health. Using cannabis will impair your procedural and episodic memory. CBD alone does not impair memory—and may even help it. Cannabis has not been shown to permanently damage memory. Cocaine, Ecstasy, methamphetamine, opioids, and psychedelics will all impair your memory. Cocaine can cause strokes—even in young people—and may lead to vascular dementia and life-long consequences for memory.",

      "abstract": "Objectives ： It has long been advocated that abstinence is the only way to realistically and effectively cope with alcoholism. In opposition to controlled drinking (moderation), the valid reasons for abstinence were reviewed. Methods ： A search was conducted through PubMed using the keywords abstinence and/or moderation. And related books were also sought. Results ：Alcoholics should not practice moderation but abstinence instead for the following reasons. 1) The core concept of the definition of addiction is ‘loss of control.’ 2) Disruption of orbitofronto-striatal functional connectivity underlying perseveration in alcoholics makes them rigid and incapable of controlling drinking. 3) To prevent brain damage caused by repeated excitotoxicity. 4) Long-term follow up studies on alcoholics’ drinking have revealed the inevitable failure of moderation. 5) Due to the reinstatement phenomenon. 6) Moderation is a step towards another relapse. 7) As addicts attach to alcohol, detachment from alcohol makes them form a healthy attachment. 8) For the sake of their loved ones. 9) Abstinence is safer and simpler than moderation. 10) Moderate drinkers do not stand for alcoholics. Conclusion : Moderation is a fit for a few addicts but abstinence is a better fit for the majority of addicts. Although abstinence should be an imperative goal of alcoholics, it should not be forced but instead chosen.",

      "abstract": "Introduction – Undergraduate students are transitioning to a learning curriculum, it's not unexpected that many of them are stressed out by academic and non-academic pressures. Many college students use psychostimulants, which are supplied legally or illegally, to cope with their pressures. College student consume coffee, which is known to contain caffeine, to remain awake for a longer period, improve their physical energy, and stay focused on their work. Furthermore, for academic purposes, students use psychostimulants. Although the number of college students who use psychostimulants without a prescription is modest, It's a form of drug addiction with potentially fatal effects. Methods – The author uses journals with a range of 2011-2021 to discuss the use of psychostimulants in college students. Results – Many college students consume caffeine, but studies show that they also use amphetamine non-medical prescription stimulants such as Adderall and methylphenidate, which are sold under the brand names Ritalin and Adderall. Discuss – Students commonly take non-medical prescription stimulants for a variety of reasons, including improving focus, being more productive with academic activities, working more efficiently, and reducing distractions. Sleep deprivation, sadness, abnormal movements, hallucinations, tachycardia, and loss of appetite are all common adverse effects of psychostimulants. Conclusion – Undergraduate students abuse psychostimulants because they can minimize their stresses and thus perform better in class. The usage of psychostimulants rises as the exam time approaches. Caffeine, a legal psychostimulant, has been found to improve alertness and concentration, allowing it to preserve cognitive performance that has deteriorated due to a lack of sleep.

Gorging is defined as an excessive intake of alcohol in shorts periods of time, the “binge drinking”what brings about phenomena like “la previa” in Argentina or “el botellon” in Spain. About daily medication intake, it can be said that through it a feeling of personal and social well- being is pursued, leaving aside the purpose of healing. The characteristics acquired by drug consumption nowadays are just definitions of new consumption criteria about substances that existed throughout and which become a challenge for different disciplines and which demand the need of creating new descriptive models to handle this problem.\r\nKey words\r\nDrug Consumption Binge Medicalization",

      "abstract": "Substance addiction is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a recurrent desire to continue taking a psychoactive substance despite the harmful consequences. Alcohol is the most commonly used psychoactive substance and one of the most significant criminogenic factors, especially when committing violent crimes. The crimes committed by alcohol addicts are most often related to acute alcohol intoxication, which occurs in approximately half of violent crimes as well as in half of sexual crimes. The role of alcohol is important in violence between intimate partners and road accidents, but also in non-violent crimes. Alcohol dependence is more prevalent in prison population than in general population. Drug addicts commit disproportionately more crimes than the general population. Although most crimes are acquisitive, some research has shown that drug addicts commit several other types of crimes, including violent ones. Heroin, crack and cocaine are most often associated with crime, while people who use cannabis are the least prone to crime. Although there are more men among drug addicts, but also perpetrators of crime, women drug addicts are much more often involved in criminal activities than women who do not use drugs. Gambling addiction is a behavioral addiction that activates a reward system similar to drug abuse and has some behavioral symptoms that can be compared to substance addiction. Gambling addicts most\r\noften commit non-violent crimes for financial gain, but compared to the general population, they also commit more violent crimes and crimes related to drugs. In order to reduce the number of crimes committed by addicts, addiction needs to be adequately treated. The sourt may also impose a security measure of addiction treatment on an addicted perpetrator of a\r\ncriminal offense. Treatment must be individualized. Psychiatric comorbidities that are much more common in addicts, and especially in addicts who commit crimes, than in the general population should be also considered when treating an addict. It is important to prevent addictions through school programs, legal regulations, and media campaigns.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine dependence is found in at least a billion people worldwide and in millions in the United States and Great Britain. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in all countries, and both active smoking and exposure to passive smoke has significant health care consequences. There currently are public health campaigns in both the UK and USA to combat smoking, and laws against smoking in public places are just one, if not one of the most visible, of the various public and community campaigns against smoking. While these campaigns are effective, most smokers wishing to quit will utilize pharmacological treatments which involve primarily nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or the use of bupropion. Both have substantial evidence as to effectiveness, though there are other secondary pharmacological treatments that also are beginning to find some support such as vareniciline, clonidine and nortriptyline. The NRTs come in various forms from patches to nasal sprays to gum, inhalers, and lozenges. All have substantial support for their effectiveness. Cognitive-behavioural therapies, especially multi-modal interventions that are tailored to the specific patient, have a good deal of success and support for that success as well. Despite these effective interventions, smoking remains a major public health problem.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is the most important preventable cause of death and disease. Despite an increased awareness of the addictive nature of smoking and availability of effective treatments, smoking continues to be widespread among individuals with psychiatric disorders. Moreover, mental health professionals remain reluctant to address smoking among their patients for a variety of reasons. Recent research has provided a wealth of data that have shaped the concept of tobacco smoking as a chronic addictive disorder and also demonstrated the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions. This paper reviews the important factors that contribute to smoking and the various pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for smoking cessation from a biopsychosocial perspective. It also makes recommendations for the rational use of these interventions to treat nicotine dependence in individuals with psychiatric disorders.",

Alcohol use is probably the best example of the power of informal social controls to mediate a drug's pharmacological potential for harm. Alcohol is clearly a very dangerous drug. Physical addiction to alcohol can develop within a few weeks, and alcohol use is associated with dozens of physical and psychological problems, and with motor vehicle crashes, falls, accidental injuries. Assimilation of informal social controls begins in the family as children see their parents and adults drink. In some families, the socialization process includes allowing children to consume small quantities of alcohol. Formal social controls, the laws and regulations governing alcohol use, tend to buttress the norms and rituals that support controlled use. Informal social controls that encourage control, discourage abuse also operate within the subculture of illicit drug users.",

Several clinical studies have evaluated their efficacy in smoking cessation but most of them are prospective cohort studies. Only two randomized, controlled trials have compared e-cigarettes versus placebo or patches. A meta-analysis of these two randomized, controlled trials has been performed. Nicotine-containing e-cigarettes appear to help smokers unable to stop smoking altogether to reduce their cigarette consumption when compared with placebo. However, these results are rated ‘low’ by GRADE standards. Many cohort studies have been conducted, with contradictory results. For some, e-cigarettes could increase the risk of nonsmokers developing nicotine dependence and of current smokers maintaining their dependence. The debate remains open and more randomized trials are needed with long-term data about the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes.",

Those who drink and drink heavily are more likely to be young, white, single, to have a higher education and income, and to be employed outside the home. However, women who drink during pregnancy, and particularly, those who continue to drink through the third trimester are different. They are older, more likely to be black, and they have higher rates of illicit drug use, less education, and lower social status. Marijuana and cocaine are used less frequently. However, women of childbearing age have the highest rates of use for both these drugs. Women who use marijuana during pregnancy are more often black, unmarried, and of lower social class. Cocaine users tend to be black, older, unmarried, and also of lower socioeconomic status. Both groups more frequently use other illicit drugs and, in general, receive less prenatal care. Therefore, for alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine, the highest rates of use are found among women of childbearing age. The women most likely to use substances during pregnancy are women who also have other characteristics that are, in themselves, significant risk factors for poor pregnancy outcome. These covariates must be considered in the evaluation of the effects of prenatal substance use.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is epidemic and dangerous. Weight loss is difficult but worth the effort. Although new weight-loss drugs are available, there are no magic bullets: to lose weight and keep it off, people must eat less and exercise more. This article presents a practical approach on how physicians can help their patients lose weight through diet, behavior modification, and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy. An appropriate initial goal is to lose 5% to 10% of one's baseline weight over 3 to 6 months. Drug therapy should not be used in isolation, but it can be an adjunct to diet, exercise, and behavior modification if a patient is committed and able to make necessary changes in eating and activity, and if the patient has a BMI of 30 or higher or a BMI greater than 27 with weight-related comorbid conditions. Anorectic therapy is unlikely to succeed and should be stopped if the patient does not lose at least 4 lb in the first 4 weeks of therapy. Orlistat is unlikely to be of benefit if patients do not lose at least 3% of their baseline weight by 12 weeks. Because obesity is a chronic disease, drug treatment should be continued indefinitely. The physician and patient must understand the intention to treat long-term. The weight loss plan devised should improve upon previous plans: for example, implementing a regular, convenient exercise program that had not been included in the past, or offering pharmacotherapy.",

Given that substance use behaviors typically develop before pregnancy, and risk factors associated with prenatal cannabis use are often present prior to conception, preventive approaches to addressing prenatal cannabis use would benefit from focusing on women who use cannabis prior to pregnancy. In order to ensure preconception cannabis use is brought to the forefront of cannabis prevention efforts, we recommend additional research, patient education, and clinician training focused on preconception cannabis use.",

      "abstract": "Vaping is the act of inhaling an aerosol generated by an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette), a battery-powered device that heats a reservoir of liquid, typically nicotine-containing, to deliver contents to the user. E-cigarettes were initially introduced as a means of smoking cessation, although evidence of their effectiveness is limited. There is a widespread perception that these products are a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, driven in large part by marketing efforts by e-cigarette manufacturers. Yet to achieve vaporization, temperatures are so high that components of the device hardware, such as metals, plastics, rubber and foam, are aerosolized and inhaled along with the vaporized e-liquid containing nicotine, flavoring and solvents. We do not fully understand the health consequences of such aerosol exposure, particularly long-term effects, but short-term negative cardiovascular and respiratory effects have been demonstrated. Very few studies have evaluated the reproductive effect of e-cigarette use. We do not know whether vaping during pregnancy affects birth outcomes or the lifelong health of the fetus. There has been an exponential rise in the use of e-cigarettes in the United States since their introduction, particularly among youths, while concurrently there has been a laudable reduction in conventional cigarette use. It is imperative that obstetrician–gynecologists have a basic understanding of e-cigarettes, screen all patients as is consistently done for conventional smoking, and provide resources to patients about potential negative consequences of use.",

      "title": "Denicotinized cigarettes: a new tool to combat cigarette addiction?",
      "abstract": "The study reported in this issue by Donny et al. [1] represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the learning processes that contribute to cigarette addiction. By showing that nicotine delivery enhances the acquisition of reward value, and that removal of nicotine leads to partial extinction of cigarette reward, the study is a nice application of the principles of reinforcement to the important problem of cigarette addiction. Further, denicotinized cigarettes may offer a novel and promising approach to smoking cessation treatment; Donny et al. [1] found that denicotinized cigarettes were effective in relieving craving even as their reinforcing potency waned over time. Thus, in a treatment setting, denicotinized cigarettes might provide a means to reduce craving while serving as a stepping stone to total abstinence. It may be hypothesized that smokers will find it less difficult to relinquish denicotinized cigarettes than to quit smoking conventional cigarettes. The findings also tie in with efforts by our group to achieve smoking cessation through the repeated presentation of denicotinized cigarettes during the weeks leading up to a target quit-smoking date [2, 3]. The potentially important advantage of this approach over other laboratory-based extinction procedures is that extinction takes place in the varied contexts of the smoker's environment. Therefore, extinction may not be as susceptible to the 'renewal effect'[4], in which a formerly extinguished response returns if the response was extinguished in one specific context and the context is subsequently changed. Complementing these real-world clinical trials, however, the laboratory-based study by Donny et al. allows more precise control over the cue-exposure conditions to examine basic underlying mechanisms. As mentioned above, a key finding of the Donny et al. study is that denicotinized cigarettes retained their potency in relieving craving for cigarettes throughout the 11-day study period. One implication of this result is that craving relief does not constitute sufficient reinforcement to fully maintain self-administration behavior. Thus, distinct components of cigarette reinforcement may contribute to different aspects of the dependence process, and these components should be studied further in terms of underlying brain mechanisms and clinical implications. Like all studies, the Donny et al. study provided some answers and raised some important questions. One question is whether the decline in reinforcing value of the denicotinized cigarettes was due to the disruption in the association between smoking and nicotine reinforcement, as opposed to the decrease in nicotine dependence over time. After removal of nicotine, the most severe withdrawal symptoms would have probably abated over several days and this decrease in perceived need for nicotine could have resulted in decreased motivation to self-administer the denicotinized cigarettes, apart from the cue-exposure extinction effect. It would have been helpful to collect data on self-administration at some points in the no-smoking group to assess the influence of the length of nicotine abstinence per se. Another interesting issue is whether, in a clinical setting, denicotinized cigarettes might be best used with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and, if so, which modality of NRT would best complement these cigarettes. In a clinical trial using a nicotine skin patch in conjunction with denicotinized cigarettes, patch treatment was shown to increase compliance with the regimen of denicotinized cigarette use [3]. In contrast, in the placebo patch control condition, the transition from the usual brand cigarette to denicotinized cigarettes without NRT led to lapses in which high nicotine cigarettes were smoked, thus undermining the efficacy of the denicotinized cigarette treatment. Appropriate treatment approaches incorporating both NRT and denicotinized cigarettes may allow for the maximal dissociation of smoking behavior from nicotine reward, thereby weakening the smoking habit. Yet another open area for investigation is the extent to which the denicotinized cigarettes present pharmacologically active substances in addition to the presentation of smoking cues. For example, although nicotine levels are extremely low in denicotinized cigarettes, it has been shown recently that inhalation of only one or two puffs of nicotine-containing smoke occupies approximately 50% of alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain [5]. Thus, even the low levels of nicotine delivered from smoking a few denicotinized cigarettes would be expected to occupy a substantial fraction of nicotinic receptors, a prediction confirmed recently by Dr Arthur Brody and colleagues at UCLA. Moreover, might other psychoactive constituents in tobacco [e.g. monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, acetaldehyde] contribute to the craving reducing effects of denicotinized cigarettes [6]? Clearly, there are many studies that need to be conducted to investigate further the effects of denicotinized cigarettes, which will probably yield important knowledge relevant to the design of more effective smoking cessation treatments. Standard nicotine replacement strategies have produced only modest progress toward achieving higher quit-smoking rates [7], and an important missing element has been the means to address the conditioned cues and behavioral components of smoking [8]. Additional studies of denicotinized cigarettes should ascertain the optimal ways of exploiting their potential as a promising new tool to combat tobacco addiction. Denicotinized cigarettes may therefore represent a classic instance of 'fighting fire with fire'.",

      "title": "Health hazards related to energy drinks: Are we looking for them?",
      "abstract": "A 14-year-old Caucasian girl presented to the emergency department with a persistent headache lasting 6 h, which was not relieved by acetaminophen and ibuprofen, her fourth similar episode of the month. She worried about having already missed five days of school and wanted medication to prevent further episodes.\r\n\r\nShe denied any recent illness or drug ingestion. The patient had many friends, as well as a boyfriend, and could not think of any stress factors to explain her new condition. Approximately five weeks previously, a friend introduced her to energy drinks that she believed helped her become more focused on her school work. Additional inquiry revealed the presence of nervousness and insomnia; additionally, she mentioned that on two occasions her heart started to beat very quickly. She then asked, “Do you think that the three energy drinks I had yesterday could be related to my headache?”\r\n\r\n\r\nLEARNING POINTS\r\n\r\n‘Energy drinks’, as they have been called by the beverage industry, are commercially available nonalcoholic, carbonated and noncarbonated drinks that claim to boost energy level, alertness and performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main active ingredient in energy drinks is caffeine, present in varying amounts; however, guarana, sometimes called herbal caffeine, is considered to be a natural product and is not included in the amount of caffeine identified on the can or bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2006, more than 30% of adolescents reported using energy drinks. Caffeine metabolism slows down during puberty because of the natural surge of growth hormone, potentially increasing the risk of symptomatic effects and complications, especially in combination with other medications such as psychostimulants or amphetamines. \r\n\r\n○ Known adverse effects of caffeine are: headache, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, hallucinations, delirium and even death.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ Caffeine-associated withdrawal symptoms include: headache, tiredness, sleepiness, dysphoric mood, difficulty concentrating, decreased cognitive performance, depression, irritability, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches and stiffness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 2011 CPSP survey on energy drinks revealed that: \r\n\r\n○ among 741 respondents, 9% (n=65) reported caffeine-related complications.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ according to the patients with complications, the three most frequent reasons for consuming these products were: to increase alertness (41%), peer pressure (39%) and sports performance (25%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn emerging trend in bars and dance clubs is to combine energy drinks with alcohol, which increases the risk of not realizing one’s degree of intoxication and the associated impairment of motor coordination and visual reaction time, as well as the risk of alcohol-related consequences, such as being physically hurt or injured, being taken advantage of sexually or taking advantage of another sexually, and riding with an intoxicated driver. \r\n\r\n○ In the CPSP survey, 28% of those who presented with complications associated with energy drinks had also consumed alcohol, and 26% had taken other drugs (psychostimulants 30%, cannabis 20% and amphetamines 10%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaediatricians and other health care providers: \r\n\r\n○ can play a very important role in educating children and adolescents about and in screening for energy drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ must inform the public on the potential health hazards related to excessive intake of caffeine-containing beverages by children and adolescents.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ should advocate for continued and better regulation of products containing a high concentration of caffeine.",

La ruta de administracion de nicotina tipicamente empleada es el cigarrillo, que ayuda a los sujetos a autorregular sus niveles de nicotina y a que estos permanezcan constantes. La nicotina actua sobre los receptores nicotinicos de ACh, que estan distribuidos por el SNC y SNP. Se trata de un agonista de la acetilcolina, neurotransmisor especialmente implicado en la mayoria de funciones cognitivas. La mayoria de fumadores afirman que fumar disminuye la ansiedad, mejora la atencion y disminuye el apetito, entre otros efectos. En general, la nicotina puede mejorar el rendimiento cognitivo, aunque esto depende un gran numero de factores, como la exposicion previa a la nicotina, el tiempo de abstinencia requerido, la dosis empleada, etc.El objetivo del presente trabajo fue evaluar los efectos del tabaco y de su abstinencia sobre la ejecucion de diferentes tareas cognitivas (atencionales, psicomotoras, tiempo de reaccion y estimacion temporal).Los objetivos especificos se centraron en comparar los efectos del tratamiento experimental (fumar vs no fumar) en las siguientes pruebas cognitivas: percepcion del tiempo (5 y 10 segundos), tiempo de reaccion simple, ejecucion psicomotora (test de destreza manual Purdue) y atencion (test de Stroop y Trail-Making test). Para ello se disenaron dos experimentos en los que se valoraron los efectos de fumar un cigarrillo despues de una abstinencia minima (30 minutos) y tras un periodo mas prolongado de privacion nocturno (10 horas). Todos los sujetos pasaron por dos sesiones experimentales y fueron divididos en varios grupos, en funcion del tratamiento experimental recibido en cada sesion. Fumar despues de un periodo minimo de abstinencia no tiene efectos positivos claros sobre la ejecucion en las distintas pruebas cognitivas,",

      "title": "SOLVENT SNIFFING",
      "abstract": "The vapors of a wide variety of organic solvents contained in such products as glues, paint thinner, fingernail polish removers, and cleaning and lighter fluids are being used by juveniles for the deliberate induction of intoxication. Such practices recently reached epidemic proportions in many areas of this country and, while the faddist aspect has now largely subsided, chronic \"sniffing\" appears to have emerged as a permanent and relatively common form of aberrant childhood behavior. Various observations of the problem suggest that sniffing provides a chemical escape from reality which is more adaptable, and therefore more readily accepted, by young children than are such other intoxicating practices as alcohol ingestion or the use of narcotic drugs. The greater adaptability of the former resides primarily in inexpensiveness, ease of concealment, and ease of procurement for supposedly legitimate purposes. The result is the development of dependence or habituation of youngsters at a far younger age than would otherwise be likely. The impression is gained that sniffing is the counterpart in the young child of the abuse of narcotics, alcohol, or LSD in older individuals. The pyschodynamics of this phenomenon, however, are not clear and there may be common factors underlying the widespread, recurrent use of or dependence on substances such as betel morsels, amphetamines, barbiturates, and even tobacco and caffeine (in coffee and tea). All of these result in a physiochemical modification of the sensorium, usually with a transient euphoric or stimulant effect. Attempts were made to characterize solvent sniffers and to assess the importance, potential dangers and the effectiveness of various control measures through original studies, a review of published data, and extensive discussion with others concerned with the problem. Among sniffers as among all juveniles apprehended by the police, there is a great preponderance of boys over girls, and the majority are in their early \"teens,\" although some are as young as 7 to 8 years of age. In areas of large Spanish-American population, members of this ethnic group comprise a disproportionately large share of sniffers, but it is noteworthy that Negroes seem definitely to be under-represented among sniffers, even in areas of very high Negro population. Although sniffers usually had prior histories of scholastic under achievement, intelligence per se bore little positive relation to the adoption of the habit. There was a definite relationship, however, to other modes of delinquency, of which most sniffers had long records. Perhaps surprisingly, such records tended not to include addictive behavior involving alcohol on narcotics, but repeated histories of exploring various solvent vapors for their intoxicating effects were usual. Among various psychosocial factors which might be considered etiologic, emotional deprivation was one which seemed to be frequently and regularly present. The intoxicating effects desired by sniffers can be produced by most volatile organic Solvents which are lipid-soluble. The popularity of some solvents is limited, however, because of undesirable properties, expense or difficulty of obtaining. The effects of solvent inhalation may often resemble those produced by alcohol, but there is a tendency for sniffing to be associated with greater impairment of judgment and reality perception. Thus, solvent vapor inhalation may lead to accident, violence, and the perpetration of various bizarre and antisocial acts. Repeated inhalation of large concentrations of vapors is associated with the development of striking tolerance and dependence, the latter often being accompanied by compulsion. Serious withdrawal symptoms, however, have been absent or rare and not at all like the intensity on pensistence of those associated with opium derivatives. That it may be the forerunner of alcoholism or narcotic addiction is perhaps implicit in the nature of the practice, but there is yet little evidence that one leads per se to the other. The toxic potential of solvent sniffing depends, of course, upon the constituents of the products employed. Some extremely dangerous solvents (e.g., carbon tetrachloride) which would not be popular among confirmed sniffers may be selected by the exploring novice or during periods of forced deprivation. Such eventualities aside, it remains unclean to what extent the more popular types of solvent sniffing (e.g., involving toluene or naphtha) are medically dangerous. In some studies, but not in others, sniffers of toluene have been found to have an abnormal incidence of vague neurological signs, hepatomegaly, eosinophilia, and, rarely, acute intracranical hypertension. The most consistent findings have been urinary abnormalities which appear to he transient; their ultimate significance, if any, is unknown at this point. Whether such findings reflect a transient, irritating effect of the chemical on the kidneys or a more destructive process capable of evolving into chronic incapacity remains to be determined. Legislation has been adopted, or proposed, in many cities and in several major states ill an attempt to control the problem, but its effectiveness remains open to question. Statutes aimed at restricting distribution (rather than abuse) of solvents is made difficult by the ubiquitousness of substances which can produce such effects. Thus, while a particular product (such as plastic cement) may be the current favorite, legislation aimed at it alone is not only discriminatory but may actually be harmful by forcing the use of alternate substances which are potentially more dangerous. Statutes aimed at abuses of the solvents (i.e., prohibition of inhalation with the intent of intoxication) provide a mechanism whereby offenders can be apprehended and, hopefully, subjected to treatment and may have some deterrent value. However, if interpreted literally they could be difficult to enforce and could technically be construed to prohibit alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine as well as \"glue.\" Individual and family treatment aimed at the underlying disorder offers the best hope of affecting a permanent cure of the habitué.",

The classic example is probably alcohol which virtually every culture learned to produce independently. Alcohol has a number of well-known effects depending upon the dosage used. In small amounts it causes flushing of the skin (vasodilatation), larger quantities produce a feeling of well-being, and if the dose is further increased, loss of inhibition occurs leading to signs of aggression. Beyond aggression, somnolence occurs and indeed coma can supervene as the central nervous system becomes progressively depressed. This well-known continuum of effects illustrates very neatly the effect of increasing dosage over a period of time with a substance which is metabolised simply and at a fairly constant rate. It further illustrates that where small quantities of a drug are useful, larger quantities are not necessarily better, in fact they are usually harmful.",

The behaviour patterns of use and abuse of this substance also caused many drug addicts to be linked to the associated consumption of multiple toxic substances, favouring the appearance of politoxicomania. The origin of the change of model in drug use began in mid-1987 and in the following years, ecstasy and the so-called designer drugs began to spread throughout the festival scene in the United Kingdom, Western Europe and the Iberian Peninsul. In the 90’s, new substances were introduced into society that had little to do with heroin use, shifting the link to toxic substances to these better accepted and less questioned substances, avoiding the possible problems associated with consumption in marginal environments. The normalization of the consumption of substances of abuse began to have a greater social tolerance, breaking the stigma that led to the alarm raised by heroin consumption in the 80’s. In this sense, drugs were no longer associated with marginalization, and were seen in environments considered festive and, therefore, “normal”.",

Obesity is one of the contemporary diseases that are psychologically tied. For this reason, some clinical applications have been used, including exercise, diet and some surgical methods. However, alternative remedies are been applied and they include herbal therapy, hunger, aromatherapy, musical, color and magnet therapies, yoga and acupuncture amongst others for one to stay healthy. The above examples are referred to as naturopathy. Hunger is a psychological stimulus and not a pathological condition. When the glycogen level in the liver or glucose in the blood falls below a ratio, this is usually followed by a desire to eat. The often unpleasant feeling originates in the hypothalamus. Hunger is seen in different religions of the world as a rule.  Hunger, as a cure or remedy to diseases, has been used at different times because of its numerous advantages. In some cases, hunger makes one to be contented, and patient with life; it also brings about good health, as staying hungry can help one to fight against obesity.

The contents of your diet will only act upon your brain if in some way they chemically resemble an actual neurotransmitter within the brain, or if they are able to interact with an essential biochemical processes in your brain that influences the production, release, or inactivation of a neurotransmitter.

      "abstract": "Objectives: Stimulant users smoke cigarettes at high rates; however, little is known about the relationship between tobacco and stimulants. Methods: Our goal in this article is to synthesize a growing literature on the role of cigarette smoking in stimulant addiction. Results: Early nicotine exposure may influence the development of stimulant addiction. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest a facilitatory role of nicotinic agonists for stimulant addiction. Smoking appears to be associated with more severe stimulant use and poorer treatment outcomes. Conclusions: It is important to assess smoking and smoking-related variables within stimulant research studies to more fully understand the comorbidity. Integrating smoking cessation into stimulant treatment may improve nicotine and stimulant treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "It is one of the paradoxes of Western, twentieth-century life that, although\nwe have access to more information than ever before, the nature of our\nindustrial society makes it harder to perceive other cultures except through\ncategories which are largely inappropriate. This, in turn, makes it harder\nto see our own culture in comparative perspective. The case of what we\ncall ‘drugs’ is an outstanding example. The term is used for a category of\nsubstances taken into the human body for purposes other than nutrition:\n‘drug’, in this sense, is opposed to ‘food’. Its contemporary usage encompasses two broad areas of meaning: medicinal preparations and chemically\nsimilar compounds consumed primarily for hedonistic purposes – where\nchanges in body chemistry are sought for their psychological rather than\nphysiological effects. ‘Drugs’ of both kinds are typically controlled by law,\neither by a system of medical prescription or by legal proscription, with\npenalties for their unauthorized possession; and the use of psychoactive\nmaterials in a non-medical context tends therefore to be characterized as\ndrug ‘abuse’. In this case, they are often described (particularly in American\nusage) as ‘narcotics’ – a term which more properly refers to substances\ncausing sleep or insensibility, but which now usually carries implications\nof illegality.1 The fact that they are often associated with a range of social\nand medical problems, through their use by deprived or disturbed groups\nwithin society, colours the terms in which the substances themselves are\ndescribed.",

      "abstract": "El dopaje se define como la promocion, incitacion, consumo o utilizacion de las sustancias y grupos farmacologicos prohibidos y de los metodos no reglamentarios destinados a aumentar, artificialmente, las capacidades fisicas de los deportistas o a modificar los resultados de las competiciones en las que participen. Las sustancias utilizadas en el dopaje provocan un aumento artificial del rendimiento deportivo y, al mismo tiempo, pueden llegar a desestabilizar las funciones fisiologicas del organismo en detrimento de la salud. El dopaje es un tema de actualidad por tres motivos: el gran numero de casos detectados, la sofisticacion de los metodos empleados, y su repercusion en los medios de comunicacion. No obstante, no es algo nuevo. El ser humano ha buscado, en todas las etapas de la historia, vias para mejorar su rendimiento fisico e intelectual. Es conocido como los chinos utilizaban la efedra cientos de anos antes de Cristo o los nativos de los Andes la coca. Despues se fueron introduciendo otras sustancias como la cafeina, las hormonas o la eritropoyetina. Tambien se ha buscado, en todas las etapas de la historia del deporte, la ayuda ergogenica en la alimentacion. Por ejemplo, se dice que en la Grecia clasica se intentaba mejorar los records mediante la ingesta de carne de cabra los saltadores, de toro los corredores y de cerdo los luchadores. La ultima polemica sobre dopaje es la del denominado Doping tecnologico. Ha tenido su mas reciente expresion en los trajes de bano de poliuretano de oro. Las muchas marcas mundiales que se rompieron en los Mundiales de Natacion de Roma, en el ano 2009, fueron relacionadas con la fabricacion de trajes de este material que permitia al nadador flotar con mayor facilidad. Segun Costa, las primeras referencias de dopaje en la epoca moderna se situan en el siglo XIX. “Cuando las famosas carreras de los Seis dias empezaron en 1897, los atletas de muchas naciones utilizaban distintos tipos de formulas para incrementar el rendimiento deportivo: los atletas franceses preferian mezclas de cafeina, los belgas azucar diluido en liquidos alcoholicos, y los velocistas se especializaban en la nitroglicerina.

      "abstract": "One of the main public health issues is tobacco use, which is also associated with considerate morbidity and mortality worldwide. Smoking cessation lowers mortality and risk of future cardiovascular events. Smoking is a true chronic condition that is defined by the emergence of a dependency state that is primarily caused by nicotine. Smokers are typically unable to quit smoking on their own. There are numerous approaches to treating smoking addiction, including both non-pharmacological such as behavioural counselling and pharmacological therapy. The effectiveness and safety of smoking cessation medications in everyday life are currently widely acknowledged. The primary pharmacological methods for quitting smoking include nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, bupropion, and cytisine. Even in patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, their effectiveness and safety have been demonstrated. It has been demonstrated that nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline, and cytisine increase the likelihood of cessation. Both varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy in combination are powerful tools for cessation. The likelihood of quitting is likewise increased by nortriptyline. Research suggests that none of the treatments seem to have a frequency of adverse reactions that would limit their usage. The clinician should tailor the smoking cessation strategy based on the most recent scientific data and the patient's preferences, giving particular attention to those patients who have certain cardiovascular and psychiatric comorbidities. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about pharmacological approach to smoking cessation and effective intervention models.",

The stereotypical image of a down-and-out heroin addict desperate for a fix can obscure the less familiar figure of the 40-something mum who secretly pops painkillers, watching the clock until it’s time for her next dose.\r\n\r\n‘Respectable addiction’ is not an emerging societal problem, as some might believe; it has been prevalent for many years. International research spanning well over a decade has suggested that a surprisingly high number of people are knowingly or otherwise abusing over the counter (OTC) medications, and there is widespread awareness of this problem among both the general public and the professionals – doctors and pharmacists – alike.\r\n\r\nNon-prescription analgesics containing codeine – a short-acting opium-based drug that belongs to the same family as heroin and morphine – are the most commonly identified OTC medicines being abused in Ireland, but problems have also been linked to products containing dextromethorphan (cough suppressant), pseudoephedrine (decongestant) and laxatives.\r\n\r\nAlthough the true extent of OTC misuse/abuse and addiction in Ireland is unclear, all indications are that it is relatively widespread and increasing. In a 2007 survey of over 100 pharmacists in Ireland, the vast majority (94%) believed that some customers, estimated at an average of four per day, who purchased products containing codeine, were addicted to codeine.\r\n\r\nAccording to the National Drug Treatment Reporting System, maintained by the Health Research Board, the numbers entering treatment for codeine as a problem drug have increased considerably in recent years, from 40 in 1998 to 180 in 2009.

Un sevrage a une substance illicite peut tres difficilement etre mene a bien sans l'aide de professionnel. Au niveau du traitement, beaucoup de recherches sont en cours.

De nombreux etablissements, structures, et associations existent pour permettre une prise en charge optimale du sevrage. De plus, depuis une vingtaine d'annees, des reseaux de professionnels de sante ont fait leur apparition et permettent une prise en charge pluridisciplinaire. Ces reseaux font de la prise en charge en milieu libre et en milieu carceral ou on remarque un retard assez inquietant de la prise en charge de la toxicomanie.

      "title": "Biological and behavioural markers of smoking reduction",
      "abstract": "Tobacco harm reduction involves strategies designed to reduce the harms associated with tobacco use, for example by cutting down cigarette consumption and thereby reducing exposure to the risks associated with smoking. In addition to potentially reducing the harms of continued smoking, there is evidence that some harm reduction strategies are positively associated with quitting smoking entirely. A variety of interventions exist that can be used to aid both cessation and smoking reduction. However, there are limitations with using current treatments, with most attempts to change smoking behaviour ultimately ending with relapse. Numerous limitations of current treatments have been noted in the past, including that existing nicotine replacement products may not provide sufficient nicotine, and / or that the time course of nicotine delivery may not be optimal for promoting reduction. The broad objective of this thesis is to understand how smoking reduction influences smoking behaviours and cessation outcomes as well as smoking-related harm exposure.\r\nTo achieve this aim, firstly, knowing the content of nicotine in supplementary products can help with interpreting the outcomes of clinical trials and with improving product design. Vaporised nicotine products (VNPs) – commonly known as electronic cigarettes – are increasingly being used by smokers to reduce their smoking, and there is some evidence that they can be effective cessation aids. A key issue with testing the effectiveness of these products, however, as been quantifying the variability in the amount of nicotine contained in products. As such, an assay was developed and applied to determine the nicotine content in one brand of VNPs which consisted of a fibrous pad in the cartridge. In addition to finding substantial variation between product batches, we also found that the measured nicotine content in the cartridge was lower than the stated content on the product label. The accurate determination of the quantity of nicotine in VNPs has important implications for both consumer safety and the further study of these devices.\r\nSecondly, smoking reduction is not only a reduction in the number of smoked cigarettes, but also an expected reduction in exposure of smoking-related harm. Biological markers can be used to indicate the intake of nicotine and smoking-related harm. 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) is a metabolite of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), which is a tobacco specific carcinogen. As such, NNAL is considered a biological marker associated with tobacco-related harm. To measure the levels of NNAL in smokers’ urine, solid phase extraction (SPE) assay has been used in previously reported studies. However, the sample preparation procedures required with these SPE assays are complicated and time consuming, limiting their use. A simple and efficient liquid-liquid extraction assay combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was designed in this study, and applied to the smokers’ urine to measure changes in harm exposure over the course of a quit attempt. As expected, the NNAL levels were significantly decreased following the quit attempt. This supports the use of NNAL as a biomarker of tobacco-related harm exposure and harm minimisation. This assay is an improvement over existing SPE-based methods in that it is substantially less complicated while maintaining adequate sensitivity and is a straightforward approach to measuring NNAL levels. The assay also demonstrated that using enzymatic hydrolysis approach of NNAL-glucuronide – had taken by other studies – as a technique for measuring the aglycone was clearly unreliable. There was a potential for significant loss of either free NNAL and NNAL aglycone. NNAL-glucuronide standards are recommended to utilise for proper validation of indirect methods such as enzymatic hydrolysis approach to measure total NNAL (free + glucuronide). \r\nFinally, we explored the mechanism through which two medications – specifically varenicline and nicotine patch – promote reduction. There has been growing research interest in using nicotine replacement medications to aid smoking reduction prior to a quit attempt. Gaining a better understanding of how treatments influence smoking reduction may allow for better tailoring of treatments and, ultimately, better cessation outcomes. The objective of the study was to test the effects of the pre-quit use of varenicline and nicotine patch on smoking rate and satisfaction with smoking. Participants in the two pre-quit treatment groups reported significant reductions in both their satisfaction with smoking and smoking rate from baseline to the end of pre-quit period; participants in the standard patch group, which started to use of nicotine patch at a quit attempt day, did not. The observed reduction of smoking rate was associated with the satisfaction with smoking, although the mediation effect of satisfaction was weak. As such, monitoring reductions in satisfaction does not appear to be a viable method of evaluating responsiveness to treatment and, or for tailoring.\r\nIn summary, this research developed a sensitive and efficient assay to determine nicotine content in supplementary nicotine products, providing valuable data for further research on these products. Furthermore, an assay for determination of NNAL levels in smokers’ urine was developed, which was applied to determine the reduction of smokingrelated harm exposure in a smoking cessation study. Finally, this research demonstrated that pre-quit treatment use led to reductions in satisfaction with smoking and the smoking rate, and the satisfaction was associated with the reduction in smoking rate. Monitoring such reductions may prove to be useful in evaluating responsiveness to treatment, risk of harm, and allow for tailoring of treatment.",

      "title": "Reducing the nicotine content of combusted tobacco products sold in New Zealand",
      "abstract": "Large reductions in nicotine content could dramatically reduce reinforcement from and dependence on cigarettes. In this article, we summarise the potential benefits of reducing nicotine in combusted tobacco and address some of the common concerns. We focus specifically on New Zealand because it may be ideally situated to implement such a policy. The available data suggest that, in current smokers, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes decrease nicotine exposure, decrease cigarette dependence, reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day and increase the likelihood of contemplating, making and succeeding at a quit attempt. New smokers would almost certainly be exposed to far less nicotine as a result of smoking VLNC cigarettes and, consequently, would probably be less likely to become chronic, dependent, smokers. Many of the concerns about reducing nicotine including compensatory smoking, an exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, the perception that VLNC cigarettes are less harmful, and the potential for a black market are either not supported by the available data, likely mitigated by other factors including the availability of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, or unlikely to offset the potential benefit to public health. Although not all concerns have been addressed or can be a priori, the magnitude of the potential benefits and the growing evidence of relatively few potential harms should make nicotine reduction one of the centrepieces for discussion of how to rapidly advance tobacco control. Policies that aim to render the most toxic tobacco products less addictive could help New Zealand attain their goal of becoming smokefree by 2025.",

This unfiltered smoke contains the same toxic components of the mainstream smoke inhaled directly by the smoker, including numerous carcinogens, many in greater concentrations. It has long been known that exposure to this type of smoke leads to increased respiratory and other adverse health conditions in non-smokers, especially children. During the past five years, evidence has been accumulating that risk of lung cancer is also higher, particularly in non-smoking women whose husbands smoke. Despite uncertainties and differences in interpretation of various cancer studies, there is ample justification for public health measures now in place or proposed, such as restriction or elimination of smoking in the workplace and in public places.",

Studies in athletes and in laboratory animals suggest that amphetamine may produce slight improvement in certain types of athletic performance. There is less scientific evidence that anabolic steroids increase strength. Stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine, and anabolic steroids, however, may increase aggressiveness during competition and in training. Psychological effects may thus outweigh actual physical effects.

      "abstract": "E-cigarettes are 95% less harmful to your health than normal cigarettes. When supported by a smoking cessation service, they help most smokers to quit tobacco altogether.\r\n\r\nKey messages:\r\n1. Smokers who have tried other methods of quitting without success could be encouraged to try e-cigarettes (EC) to stop smoking and stop smoking services should support smokers using EC to quit by offering them behavioural support. \r\n\r\n2. Encouraging smokers who cannot or do not want to stop smoking to switch to EC could help reduce smoking related disease, death and health inequalities. \r\n\r\n3. There is no evidence that EC are undermining the long-term decline in cigarette smoking among adults and youth, and may in fact be contributing to it. Despite some experimentation with EC among never smokers, EC are attracting very few people who have never smoked into regular EC use. \r\n\r\n4. Recent studies support the Cochrane Review findings that EC can help people to quit smoking and reduce their cigarette consumption. There is also evidence that EC can encourage quitting or cigarette consumption reduction even among those not intending to quit or rejecting other support. More research is needed in this area. \r\n\r\n5. When used as intended, EC pose no risk of nicotine poisoning to users, but e-liquids should be in ‘childproof' packaging. The accuracy of nicotine content labelling currently raises no major concerns. \r\n\r\n6. There has been an overall shift towards the inaccurate perception of EC being as harmful as cigarettes over the last year in contrast to the current expert estimate that using EC is around 95% safer than smoking. \r\n\r\n7. Whilst protecting non-smoking children and ensuring the products on the market are as safe and effective as possible are clearly important goals, new regulations currently planned should also maximise the public health opportunities of EC. \r\n\r\n8. Continued vigilance and research in this area are needed.",

It is likely that humans have stuck to any brew containing compounds with psychoactive properties, resulting in a better daily life, i.e., more efficient thinking, exploring, hunting, etc., however, without the serious side effects of drugs of abuse. The physiological effects of methylxanthines have been known for a long time and they are mainly mediated by the so-called adenosine receptors. Caffeine and theobromine are the most abundant methylxanthines in cacao and their physiological effects are notable. Their health-promoting benefits are so remarkable that chocolate is explored as a functional food. The consequences of adenosine receptor blockade by natural compounds present in cacao/chocolate are here reviewed. Palatability and health benefits of methylxanthines, in general, and theobromine, in particular, have further contributed to sustain one of the most innocuous and pleasant habits: chocolate consumption.",

      "abstract": "Stress is how people react when they feel under pressure or threatened. Stress typically occurs when people are in a situation that they do not feel they can manage or control. Today, more than ever, people of all ages and backgrounds experience stress which can have many negative effects on the body. Stress’ effect on the body is harmful no matter what form it is in. However, the longer that stress is present in the body, the more harmful it becomes. Stress slowly weakens the immune system and the rest of the body’s systems in different ways making the body more susceptible to certain diseases. This paper uses research done on stress’ affect on the body and the health conditions people are more prone to develop if they are stressed, to identify if stress can cause someone to develop cancer. Along with this, the paper also uses research to describe the different effects the two different forms of stress have on the body and how chronic or long-term stress affects the body systems at a larger scale in comparison to acute or short-term stress. Using this paper one can conclude that stress alone cannot directly cause a person to develop cancer, however, stress weakens the immune system and negatively affects the body making a person more prone to developing cancer. The aim of this paper is to identify how stress’ affect on the body can lead to the development of cancer and cause cancer to spread in those with cancer.",

Methylxanthines have an impact on mood and improve performance in specific tasks. Methylxanthines may therefore play the role of chocolate as an “energizer.”\r\n\r\n\r\nChocolate addiction should be regarded as an inaccurate and misleading term. “Moreishness” may be a better term. It translates as the ambivalence associated with the desire to eat more chocolate (due to high palatability) and self-imposed dietary restraint (due to personal and cultural beliefs), which limits chocolate intake before satiation is attained, making the “desire for chocolate” more salient (craving).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orosensory qualities of chocolate are uncontested determinants for chocolate liking, but ­methylxanthines also contribute to an acquired taste for chocolate liking.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEA and anandamide are unlikely to exert significant biological effects. Also, an increase in brain serotonin related to carbohydrates after chocolate consumption is unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnandamide-related compounds, salsolinol, THBCs, and magnesium cannot be discarded as ­effective psychoactive agents (see Table 31.1).",

This practice remains a global budden and deaths caused by smoking-related conditions is believed to have escalated. Many countries in the world have policies in place that regulate the production, transportation, handling and utilization of tobacco products in order to compact this budden of smoking. Despite these effort, various contributing factors of smoking amongst which peer-pressure forms part, are believed to be cause of an increase in the number of new smokers. Nicotine is one of the constituents of tobacco smoke which causes a pleasant feelings which in return contributes to addiction. Cigarette smoke contains thousands of chemicals with some known to be carcinogens. Smoking during pregnancy poses danger to a pregnant mother and her unborn babe as they exchange blood. The public needs to be educated on the danger of smoking, and exposure to second-hand smoke as well as on strategies that one can follow to quit smoking.",

      "abstract": "The review recalls the types of carcinogenic chemicals that are used in laboratories, as well as the types of cigarettes and nicotine for smokers, which are considered essential substances for cancer. Smokers are more likely to develop lung cancer, although lung cancer can also affect people who have never smoked. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time you smoke and the number of cigarettes you smoke. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing lung cancer. Inhalation of carcinogenic lab materials or smoking causes lung cancer by damaging the cells lining the lungs. When you inhale cigarette smoke that is full of cancer-causing substances (carcinogens), changes in lung tissue begin almost immediately. At first, your body may be able to repair this damage. But with each repeated exposure, the normal cells that line your lungs are increasingly damaged. Over time, the damage causes cells to function abnormally and cancer may eventually develops. Many laboratories carry specific risks, including the risk of exposure to carcinogens, and preventing accidents in the laboratory requires high care and constant vigilance. Examples of risk factors include high voltages, pressures, high and low temperatures, corrosive and toxic chemicals, chemical fumes, radiation, fire and explosions, as well as biological hazards including infectious organisms and their toxins.",

Impairs healthy growth and development, is associated with risky behaviors such as unprotected sex and dangerous driving, and contributes to the development of many other health problems. Alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco are still the most widely used substances by children and adolescents before grade 12. Daily use of marijuana has been steadily increasing among adolescents and since 2015 has even surpassed daily cigarette use in this population. There has also been a recent dramatic increase in vaping by adolescents. Opioids have now become the most used illicit drug after marijuana. The earlier teens start using substances, the greater their chances of continuing to use substances and developing substance use problems later in life.

Die Daten weisen für viele Drogen gemeinsam auf die Gefahr von plazentaren Durchblutungsstörungen hin, die sich in Mangelentwicklung, Wachstumsretardierung, vorzeitiger Wehentätigkeit, Früh- oder Totgeburt manifestieren können. Bei mehreren Drogen beschrieben sind postnatale Effekte in Form von motorischen und vor allem intellektuellen Entwicklungsstörungen. Wenig bekannt sind die Auswirkungen des Konsums der neueren Partydrogen Ecstasy und LSD. Mit Ausnahme des Alkohols sind Angaben zu Fehlbildungen bei den meisten Drogen noch ungesichert. Sie dienen aber als Orientierungshilfe bei der ausgedehnten Fehlbildungsdiagnostik, die in jedem Fall angezeigt ist. Erschwerend dürfte die Tatsache sein, dass selten nur eine Droge konsumiert wird, sondern meistens ein Mischkonsum vorliegt. Neben allen potentiellen Wirkungen darf bei der Betreuung einer Drogen konsumierenden Schwangeren zudem nicht unbeachtet bleiben, dass der Allgemeinzustand der Schwangeren oftmals erheblich reduziert und besonders bei i.v. Drogen mit zusätzlichen Gefahren (z.B. HIV) verbunden ist. Drogen konsumierende Schwangere bedürfen also einer intensiven Betreuung und Beratung der Geburtshelfer meist in Zusammenarbeit mit anderen medizinischen Disziplinen inkl. der Sozialpsychiatrie.",

Most electronic-cigarette liquids contain propylene glycol, glycerin, nicotine, and a wide variety of flavours, many of which are sweet. Sweet flavours are classified as saccharides, esters, acids, or aldehydes.

      "abstract": "Abstract The rise of e-cigarette popularity has sparked interest in the role of palatable flavors on nicotine use. Despite growing evidence that sweet flavorants enhance nicotine reward, their influence on nicotine consumption has not been studied extensively. In addition, the impact that flavored nicotine use in adolescence could have on nicotine reward and dependence in adulthood remains unclear. This study examined the role of flavored nicotine access on nicotine preference and consumption longitudinally, from adolescence to adulthood. Male and female adolescent mice preferred a fruit-flavored nicotine solution. However, only adolescent female mice with access to flavored nicotine consumed higher doses. Furthermore, while adolescent male mice escalated consumption of both flavored and unflavored nicotine, female mice only escalated when given access to flavored nicotine. As mice matured into adulthood, there was no evidence that a history of flavored-nicotine access altered preference for unflavored nicotine. However, when the nicotine concentration was reduced, mice that had consumed strawberry-flavored nicotine in adolescence maintained baseline nicotine consumption levels longer than mice that initiated nicotine use without flavor in adolescence. Finally, addition of fruit-flavorants into the nicotine solution during adulthood led to increased levels of nicotine consumption, regardless of previous flavored-nicotine access or of familiarity with the selected flavorant. These results indicate that flavorants increase nicotine consumption independent of life stage, possibly posing a disproportionate risk to adolescent females. Our results also point to an effect of adolescent flavored-nicotine use on nicotine dose maintenance in adulthood, which could have implications for the success of future quit attempts.",

Alcoholic beverages clearly increase the risk of oral cavity, liver, eso-phageal, breast, and other cancers. However, the actual mechanisms that alcohol drinking contributes to carcinogenesis have not been well defined. The use of tobacco products, as they are intended to be used, results in the exposure to more than 100 mutagens and carcinogens.

This is of particular concern for youth who have a baseline of less mature judgment. Adding energy drinks to alcohol tends to increase the rate of absorption through its carbonation and dilution of the alcohol, and keep a person awake longer allowing ingestion of a greater volume of alcohol. At low blood alcohol levels, caffeine appears to decrease some of the impairment from the alcohol, but at higher blood alcohol levels, caffeine does not appear to have a modifying effect on either the physical or mental impairment induced by the alcohol. Obtaining this combination is made easier and more affordable for under aged persons by manufacturers of premixed alcoholic energy drink combination beverages.

Doping behavior is defined as the consumption of a product in order to face or pass an obstacle and be more performant. Even among adolescents, the will to increase the efficiency in sport or to modify the body appearance, push some people to use any kind of products: nutritional supplements, doping agents (anabolic steroids, amphetamines, etc.), with all the associated risks due to the doubtful origin of some of these substances, the way they are consumed or their side effects. It is important that the medical community, and those who are in contact with the adolescents, realize that this kind of behavior exists, so to face it in an adequately manner, the same way they deal with the problem of alcohol, tobacco or drugs.",

It causes dependence on smokers, but tar is a highly potent killing substance. Therefore, in 1965 the US Congress passed a law on mandatory health warning stickers on tobacco packs. Numerous studies have shown that the health warning does not affect the reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, contrary to this warning motivates smokers to light-up a new cigarette. What actually happens in the smoker's heads and why? s the health warning a subtly designed subliminal message, or is its opposite effect a consequence of the brain filtration mechanism, or is it simply a synergy of the above-mentioned phenomena?",

The monthly consumption of gasoline in the United States increased from about 1,000,000,000 gallons in 1927 to more than 2,000,000,000 gallons in 1940,<sup>1</sup>and this was due almost entirely to its increased use as a motor fuel.

Feelings of stress/anxiety demonstrated a pattern of repetitive vacilation over the day, with high stress before smoking, reduced stress after smoking, and stress levels increasing again between cigarettes. There was no evi- dence of acute pharmacodynamic tolerance, with ciga- rettes leading to altered feelings of anxiety/stress over the whole day of smoking. Self-rated feelings of arousal also demonstrated a pattern of vacilation over the day, with low arousal pre-smoking, increased arousal post-smok- ing, but arousal levels reducing again between cigarettes. The ANOVA drug x time interaction was significant, with the greatest arousal change following the first cigarette of the day. However, later cigarettes led to similar amounts of arousal change over the rest of day, thus questioning whether acute pharmacodynamic tolerance was occur- ring. Instead, the heightened arousal response to the first cigarette of the day may reflect the influence of two other factors. Firstly, overnight deprivation, with the first ciga- rette of the day leading to the greatest increase in plasma nicotine. Secondly, low early-morning arousal with its associated potential for increased arousal. Overall, there- fore, there was little indication of acute pharmacodynamic tolerance to the subjective effects of nicotine. Cigarettes were associated with altered feelings of stress and arousal, over the whole day of smoking.",

Research has demonstrated that caffeine has beneficial effects on performance of tasks requiring sustained attention and that these effects are readily observed in low alertness situations (after lunch; at night; when a person has a cold). Although many of the studies of caffeine have used very large single doses, recent studies have demonstrated that beneficial effects can be observed with more realistic doses and drinking regimes that equate to real-life intake. Furthermore, the improved performance can be demonstrated using simulations real-life tasks and in the context of a normal working day.",

In addition, the role of crack use in furthering transmission of sexually transmitted diseases has been documented, and the implications for AIDS transmission have been speculated on. Crack use enhances social disorganization, particularly in poor urban areas, where increased child abuse, neglect, and prostitution are common. Ever present are the financial incentives to increase the number of crack users. Cocaine was once considered a drug for the elite, rich, and famous. Crack clearly has changed that notion.",

Nicotine is an important tobacco constituent that is responsible for addictive properties of smoking. The currently available medications for the treatment of nicotine addiction have limited efficacy. A challenging novel therapeutic concept is vaccination against nicotine. An efficient vaccine would generate antibodies that sequester nicotine in the blood and prevent its access to the brain. The vaccine would have great potential for treating nicotine addiction and for relapse prevention. We reviewed the current status of vaccines against nicotine addiction that are undergoing clinical trials or are in preclinical development. We discuss problems associated with the development of nicotine vaccines, their efficacy in addiction treatment, challenges and ethical concerns. Existing evidence indicates that nicotine vaccination is well tolerated and capable of inducing an immune response but its effectiveness in increasing smoking abstinence has not been shown so far.",

O alcool e uma substância que acompanha o ser humano desde os tempos mais remotos. Sempre associado a bons momentos e consumido livremente dentro dos lares, em festas e comemoracoes. Por ser uma droga licita, o alcool comeca a ser utilizado muito antes do que o indicado por orgaos de saude. Os incentivos para que ele seja consumido sao bastante atraentes para os jovens. Os resultados derivados desse uso abusivo poderao persistir durante toda a vida adulta, causando problemas fisiologicos e psicologicos. A familia de um dependente sofre as consequencias desse vicio juntamente com o alcoolatra. A degradacao familiar, a perda do emprego e as sequelas causadas nos filhos sao algumas das consequencias do uso abusivo do alcool. Dependentes se veem excluidos da sociedade e vao para as ruas, onde a alternativa de sustento se apresenta de varias maneiras. Politicas publicas aparecem como tentativas de repressao ao consumo indevido de bebidas alcoolicas. O objetivo geral da pesquisa foi mostrar as consequencias que o alcoolismo gera em todas as areas da vida do dependente. A metodologia utilizada foi a de abordagem bibliografica qualitativa-descritiva extraida de livros, artigos e revistas impressas e eletronicas voltadas para o tema em questao.

Caffeine exhibits wide inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as the tolerance and addiction that develop with regular consumption. In sport, caffeine at mild to moderate doses increases performance, including improvement of general and muscle endurance, increased mobilization of fat from adipose tissue and muscle cells, decreased perception of fatigue, increased locomotor activity, influence on reaction time, level of alertness, improvement of visual perception and increased number of activated muscle fibers. Due to its confirmed ergogenic effect, the use of caffeine in sport had been prohibited for many years, but nowadays it is considered safe and efficient supplement allowed in sport.

      "title": "Body Image Concerns, Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors in Teenagers and the Role of Tobacco Policy",
      "abstract": "Unhealthy Weight Control Behaviors (UWCBs) include using diet pills, purging (vomiting or using laxatives) and fasting for 24 hours or more to lose weight. UWCBs are prevalent among teenagers, can have potentially dangerous health consequences and are precursors to eating disorders. Yet UWCBs have been largely overlooked in economics and there are few if any government or public health interventions to address such behaviors on a broader scale. Past economic research indicates that weight-conscious adolescents also use smoking as a strategy to control their weight - teenagers' demand for cigarettes may be in part derived from their demand for weight loss. In addition, research in epidemiology and public health finds that teenagers who engage in UWCBs are much more likely to smoke. This suggests that anti-tobacco policies such as cigarette taxes targeted to combat youth smoking are a possible policy lever for understanding UWCBs. If teens use cigarette smoking to lose weight, instead of or in combination with UWCBs, or if reduced smoking leads to unintentional weight gain among teens, higher taxes could have spillover effects to UWCBs. Using repeated cross-section, individual-level data from the 1999-2013 National and State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys combined with state-level policies and characteristics, this research provides evidence on the association between smoking, body image concerns and the use of UWCBs in teenagers. Results suggest that cigarette taxes reduce smoking, including for those trying to lose/maintain weight and especially among girls. Cigarette taxes increase the incidence of UWCBs, again among girls. Specifically, my main results indicate that a $1 increase in cigarette taxes leads to a 1.2 percentage point increase in UWCB participation among teenage girls, a meaningful increase relative to the overall sample prevalence of 22.3%.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine chewing-gum has recently become available to doctors in Britain for use as an aid to giving up smoking. It produces blood nicotine concentrations similar to tobacco smoking and so relieves symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Owing partly to the slower rate of absorption of nicotine through the buccal mucosa, however, it does not reproduce the pleasure of cigarette smoking. Indeed, in the early stages it is usually slightly aversive. Optimal use in a skill requiring practice and careful instruction. Since it is an aid rather than easy cure, its use is limited to smokers who want to stop. Earlier trials showed modest advantages over placebo, but improvements in the gum and more experience in its use suggest that long-term success rates of 40% or more can be obtained. It required little time to administer and is therefore a feasible method for busy doctors.",

Clinicians and researchers alike have the need to quantify drinking patterns to determine the risk for adverse, health-related events such as injury, liver damage, and cancer. Biochemical measures of ethanol consumption are affected by temporal patterns of drinking as well as individual characteristics such as gender and age. The choice of a laboratory analysis to determine ethanol consumption is complex; no single laboratory test will predict drinking accurately across all drinking patterns, across the life span, and across gender. In conjunction with interviews and physical assessment, however, biochemical laboratory tests are sensitive tools used to measure both recent and long-term patterns of alcohol consumption.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance worldwide, that can be found in coffee, tea, energy drinks, and dietary supplements. Numerous studies have confirmed caffeine’s potential to decrease fatigue and increase performance. However, optimal dosing strategies and safety profiles across diverse athletic populations remain under active investigation. Aim: This study present the current knowledge on the prevalence of caffeine consumption, its physiological mechanisms, its impact on physical performance, and the potential risks associated with its use. Material and methods. A literature review of studies published in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was conducted, analyzing the prevalence of caffeine intake, its physiological mechanisms, effects on physical performance, and associated harms. Results. Caffeine supplementation, ingested approximately 60 minutes before exercise enhance endurance performance. In strength assessments, caffeine has been found to enhance 1RM (bench press, squat, deadlift). However caffeine also has adverse effects, including tremors, tachycardia, gastrointestinal discomfort and in some cases, cardiac arrhythmias, that can occur at doses exceeding 7 mg/kg. Caffeine metabolism can affected by genetic polymorphism, hormonal modulators and age-related factors, influence caffeine’s half-life and risk of accumulation. Conclusions. Caffeine supplementation at 3–6 mg/kg is an effective and generally safe ergogenic enhancer for increasing endurance and muscular strength. However, the narrow margin between optimal and toxic doses can be different at various population. Future research should focus on long-term safety of caffeine supplementation, the factors of inter-individual variability to caffeine safety and potential interactions with other performance-enhancing compounds.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking during pregnancy is the single largest modifiable risk for pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. Tobacco smoke contains thousands of chemicals, many of which may contribute to reproductive toxicity. Carbon monoxide is the most biologically significant toxin for the fetus. The use of nicotine replacement therapy is probably not without risk, although the magnitude of risk to the mother and fetus is much lower than continuing smoking. Most pregnant women are motivated to stop. It is, therefore, a good time to initiate smoking cessation as early as possible during pregnancy, and to maintain abstinence during post-partum to protect the infant from passive smoking. If behavioral intervention fail to produce abstinence, a sign of high dependence, nicotine replacement therapy should be initiated promptly. Although bupropion is not recommended during pregnancy, this therapy should be considered when contraindications are carefully observed. It is recommended that all patients treated with nicotine or bupropion be reported to a pregnancy registry that collects pregnancy and obstetrical outcome data. This registry would allow health professionals to share their experience and should encourage them to use pharmacotherapy more frequently and lift psychological barriers concerning its use in pregnant women.",

Narcotics deaden the personality and thus bring about an escape from an intolerable mood. The anesthesia of mood which is sought and obtained by this means is purchased at an enormous price, so far as personality worth is concerned. Caffeine, in the form of tea and coffee, has a place in the daily habits of the human being largely because of the mild toning-up process which takes place.

People sometimes overborrow money in order to spend it on leisure and/or luxury items, overeat, spend indulgent times, smoke, and gamble to the point of destitution. In all of these situations, the results of the choice to engage in such behaviors have adverse effects on the individual’s future. Moreover, self-harmful behavior is not always limited to the extreme cases described above. For example, on occasion, we sometimes stay up drinking until late at night even though we have a meeting early the next morning. As another example, rather than completing an important task with an impending deadline, we often engage in trivial tasks such as cleaning our work desk, checking e-mails, and self-grooming.",

      "title": "Could Vaping be a New Weapon in the Battle of the Bulge?",
      "abstract": "As the prevalence of tobacco smoking has been decreasing, obesity has increased. Obesity is set to overtake tobacco smoking in many developed countries as the primary preventable cause of conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Obesity is a complex condition that is challenging public health prevention efforts. Tobacco smoking mitigates weight gain through nicotine's effect on the brain and metabolism. The prospect of gaining weight upon stopping smoking acts as an inhibitor to quitting and weight gain post-cessation is a common cause of relapse. Vaping nicotine is a new and controversial phenomenon that is highly attractive to smokers, but raises fears for health among public health and tobacco control advocates. There have been some reports among vapers that vaping is helping to mitigate weight gain after stopping smoking and or vaping is helping them to control their weight. There are several potential mechanisms by which vaping, in addition to the direct effects of nicotine, could facilitate weight control, these include taste perception, physical mouthfeel, and sensation and behavioral replacement. Research on the potential for vaping to support weight control may be worth pursuing given the human and economic costs of the global obesity epidemic and the failure of current obesity prevention strategies. Obesity is set to overtake tobacco smoking in many countries as the primary cause of several high-cost diseases. Tobacco smoking mitigates weight gain through nicotine's effect on the brain and metabolism. Smoking, however, is associated with many illnesses and premature death and appropriately has been discouraged leading to declining prevalence rates. This article explores the emerging perception that vaping electronic cigarettes with nicotine and flavors could deliver similar appetite and weight control effects as smoking. The potential to reduce risks associated with excess weight deserves exploration. An initial research agenda is suggested.",

Interestingly there are reports on the use of nicotine and its effects on the epigenetic changes in the brain. These kinds of changes may prepare the brain for further abuse of various illegal drugs. As a result of chronic nicotine exposure brain infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, brain atrophy, and dementia are also known to occur. Neurodevelopment in children is potentially harmed due to exposure to nicotine and nicotinic products. This is due to the inflammation, atherosclerosis, and oxidative stress to the neuronal cells.

Results showed that users display preferences, with the use of some drugs being favoured over time. Injectors used all drugs more frequently than smokers. Although there was much variability in frequency of use the trend over the initial 3 years of use showed no increase in heroin use for either smokers or injectors. Although the majority of smokers had injected heroin there was no evidence that this group favoured injecting over time; rather the data suggested that smoking became the increasingly preferred method of consumption. Smokers were more likely than injectors to use other drugs post-heroin. Contrary to expectation, few periods of abstinence were reported by the subjects in either group.",

Additionally, regular users of illicit substances may exhibit poor medication adherence or impaired ability to engage in behaviours such as blood glucose testing in diabetes.Systematic research on drug interactions with illicit drugs is not routinely conducted – most evidence comes from case reports. However, drug interactions are important. Many deaths that are attributed to illicit drug toxicity alone are often actually the result of drug interactions.

      "title": "Cigarette-Derived Nicotine is not a Medicine",
      "abstract": "Regular smokers feel better when smoking than not smoking, and empirical studies confirm that nicotine reinstatement relieves feelings of stress, depression and anger. These acute mood changes have led to the belief that cigarette-derived nicotine can provide medicinal benefits for smokers. However, prospective studies of adolescents who take up cigarette smoking find that they report increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression. Furthermore, adults who quit smoking report enduring mood improvements. Thus the prospective data shows that the nicotine derived from cigarettes leads to heightened distress. The empirical patterns of mood change reported by regular smokers show why nicotine dependency is psychologically damaging. Regular smokers report average moods when replete with nicotine, but suffer mood deteriorations in-between cigarettes. Thus the supposed mood gains of smoking only represent the temporary relief of withdrawal symptoms. This mood relief becomes conditioned with smoke inhalation, which is why cigarettes are regarded positively by smokers. However, the repetitive experience of irritability and other abstinence symptoms in between cigarettes paradoxically causes smokers to suffer worse daily moods than non-smokers. The stronger the nicotine dependency the greater the mood decrements, helping to explain why disadvantaged individuals often smoke heavily and find quitting difficult. In conclusion, there is no empirical evidence that cigarettes provide medicinal benefits, but extensive data showing that nicotine dependency heightens psychological distress in tobacco smokers.",

The core features of addiction are manifest in the continued performance of the behavior despite adverse consequences, compulsive engagement or diminished control over the behavior, and an appetitive urge or craving state prior to the behavioral engagement representing core elements (Holden, 2010).",

      "abstract": "People use herbal preparations (food supplements and herbal tea) with St John’s wort, amongst others to feel and sleep better. However, these herbal preparations can reduce the effect of medicines, or enhance their effect. These interactions can have serious health effects. Herbal preparations with St John’s wort, for example, reduce the effect of certain medicines prescribed for fungal or viral infections and for cancer (chemotherapy). The effect of certain consciousness-lowering agents, e.g. sedative medicines, and consciousness-stimulating agents, e.g. antidepressants, is actually enhanced. The use of herbal preparations with St John’s wort may also pose health risks when used alone and not in combination with medicines. For example, the skin can be damaged faster (sunburn) if people sit in the sun after using St John’s wort. Other effects such as dizziness, diarrhea and anxiety have also been reported after the use of herbal preparations containing St. John's wort. It is not known what effects occur after people use these herbal preparations for a long time. There is also insufficient information available to determine whether the use of St John’s wort during pregnancy is safe for the unborn child. Moreover, the composition of herbal preparations containing St John’s wort can vary greatly, and it is often not known what exactly is in it. This makes it difficult to estimate the effects of a product. RIVM draws these conclusions based on a risk assessment on behalf of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS). RIVM advises consumers to be cautious with the use of herbal preparations containing St John’s wort, and to not use these products in combination with medicines. RIVM advises VWS to draft legislation on the use of St John’s wort in herbal preparations.",

Most of the old people use the painkillers, barbiturates and other dangerous substances when they accused pain, the goal of these substances being the painkillers. Unfortunately, most of the people use such pharmaceuticals without a specialized consult and the abuse of such substances lead to serious disorders of human body. On the other hand, most of the young people that suffer this type of intoxication use soft drugs, the main reason being the age or the entourage. The appearance of a high number of weed shops encourages, unfortunately, the consumption of the soft drugs from the youngsters. Also, the try of something new or eccentricities is also another reason of intoxications. The uses of these substances, without good information and also in excess may lead even at the death of the victim. In the case of elder peoples the primary reason is constituted by the improvement of various pains and distress. Unfortunately, the use of perfectly legal substances in various combinations has the same results as when is the use of harmful substances.

The composition of vape liquid and the harm caused by each component separately, including glycerin, propylene glycol, is described. Vegetable glycerin is used for refueling electronic cigarettes, which determines the flavor. Propylene glycol is used to dissolve flavorings. The role of nicotine is more detailed than the other components, because among other things it is a neurotoxin and addictive. Literature sources have been analyzed to study the formation of pathological changes in tissues and organs during the use of electronic cigarettes. One of the first systems to be negatively affected by smoking is the respiratory system. Nicotine causes prolonged constriction of capillaries and arterioles, due to which normal gas exchange in the lungs is disturbed. Under the influence of nicotine is depressed activity of the nervous system. But the insidiousness of nicotine is not only that. Particularly dangerous to health long-term smoking. The brain gets used to the constant supply of nicotine. On the blood vessels nicotine has a spasmodic effect, promotes thrombosis. Diseases associated with the use of electronic delivery of nicotine, called EVALI, are presented, the latter meaning “lung injury associated with the use of electronic cigarettes”. The review emphasizes the negative effects of nicotine on the digestive system. Smoking contributes to narrowing of stomach vessels, gastric juice secretion is disturbed, and its composition changes, appetite decreases, peristalsis changes, and digestive diseases occur. To date, there is a growing trend in the number of people smoking electronic cigarettes, which is actively promoted by marketers [8]. They position smoking e-cigarettes as a fashion that does not cause harm to health. But this is a big misconception. E-smoking is virtually the same as regular smoking, except that e-cigarettes do not contain tar. The availability of vapes increases the trend of increasing use of these products by schoolchildren, which is a serious social problem.",

In this situation it is proposed to proceed by steps, diminishing gradually the number of smoked cigarettes with the help of nicotine containing preparations. The patient tries to avoid the cigarette by boosting his serum nicotine level with the inhaler or the nicotine gum as often as possible and seeks to understand the reasons why he is a smoker.

Es en el rango de edad entre 15-24 anos donde se encuentra mayor consumo de alcohol y tabaco, y mayor consumo de riesgo, coincidiendo con el rango de edad mayoritario en universitarios. La universidad es una etapa en la que muchos estudiantes tienen su primer contacto con estas drogas legales.\nEl alcohol y tabaco son drogas que estan arraigadas en la sociedad espanola, puesto que forman parte de acontecimientos y celebraciones, al igual que ocurre en la universidad, donde estas estan presentes a la hora de socializar y reunirse con otros universitarios, reuniones en las que el consumo de alcohol se da de una forma intensiva, de tipo binge drinking, los fines de semana.\nPor otro lado, en esta etapa se adquieren o se fortalecen ciertos habitos que con el paso del tiempo son complicados de modificar. Por lo que es fundamental adquirir unos habitos saludables, tanto en alimentacion, como actividad fisica y/o comportamiento sexual, para que asi perduren en las demas etapas de la vida. Por otra parte, los habitos saludables se pueden considerar como una proteccion frente a la adquisicion de habitos nocivos, en este estudio el consumo de alcohol y tabaco.\nTodo lo expuesto llevo a preguntarse ?Como es el consumo de alcohol y tabaco en universitarios?, ?Que habitos en relacion a la alimentacion, actividad fisica y comportamiento sexual tienen los estudiantes?, ?Existe una relacion entre estos habitos saludables y habitos nocivos? Asi mismo, dados los horarios que frecuentan los universitarios tambien surgen las preguntas ?Que cronotipo tienen los estudiantes?, y ?En que influye en sus habitos?\n\n2.contenido de la investigacion\nDiseno: Estudio de tipo descriptivo observacional comparativo.\nSujetos y ambito de estudio: Estudiantes universitarios de las Universidades de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha (Espana). El estudio se planteo para abarcar la totalidad de estudiantes de ambas universidades. Criterios de inclusion: alumnos matriculados en las Universidades de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha en estudios de Grado, Master y Doctorado. Participaron un total de 464 estudiantes, de los cuales se excluyeron 7 por cuestionarios incompletos. Reclutando finalmente una muestra de 457 alumnos.\nVariables del estudio: variables sociodemograficas, consumo de alcohol, consumo de tabaco, actividad fisica y deportiva, habitos alimenticios, comportamiento sexual y cronotipo.\nInstrumentos: Se utilizo un cuestionario que recogia datos sociodemograficos, asi como los cuestionarios especificos de las variables a estudio: el cuestionario Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) de Saunders et al. (1993) version en espanol por Guillamon et al. (1999); el Test de Dependencia a la Nicotina de Fagerstrom (1978) version de Becona et al. (1992), Test de Richmond (1993) version de Cordoba et al (2000), International Physical Activity Questionnarie (IPAQ-SF) Craig et al (2003), Mediterranean Diet Quality Index (Kidmed) Serra-Majem et al. (2004), la Encuesta Revisada de Opinion Sexual (EROS) de del Rio Olvera et al. (2013), y Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire de Adan y Almirall (1990).\nAnalisis de datos: el analisis estadistico se realizo con el programa IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. El analisis estadistico consistio en un analisis descriptivo mediante el calculo de recuentos (n) y proporciones (%) para las variables cualitativas y mediante el calculo de media (m) y desviacion estandar (DE) para variables cuantitativas. Tambien se realizo una comparacion de proporciones de las variables categoricas mediante pruebas ji-cuadrado para tablas de contingencia. Ademas, se realizo una regresion logistica multiple para identificar las variables asociadas al consumo de alcohol, tabaco, ejercicio fisico, adherencia a la dieta mediterranea, comportamiento sexual y cronotipo.\nConsideraciones eticas: El proyecto se presento al Comite de Etica de la investigacion de la provincia de Cordoba (Acta No 269, ref. 3640), Cumplimiento de la ley organica 15/1999, de 13 de diciembre, de Proteccion de datos, de caracter personal, del Estado Espanol. Normativa vigente en el periodo de estudio. El link de acceso al cuestionario presentaba al inicio el informe del Comite de Etica y la Hoja de Informacion y Consentimiento Informado.\nResultados: Los universitarios, estudiantes tanto de la Universidad de Cordoba (UCO) como de la Universidad de Castilla La Mancha (UCLM) tienen un consumo de alcohol de riesgo el 29,5%, dandose con mayor frecuencia en mujeres y en la UCLM. El 27,6% consume tabaco, teniendo baja dependencia el 78,6%, y la mitad de los estudiantes presentan motivacion para dejar de fumar.\nEl 52,5% de estudiantes practica actividad fisica de nivel alto, destacando este nivel en el genero masculino.\nCon respecto a la dieta mediterranea, el 37% presenta adherencia alta, en relacion al comportamiento sexual se muestra una tendencia hacia la erotofilia. Sobre el cronotipo en universitarios, tras el cronotipo intermedio, la predisposicion de los universitarios es de tipo vespertino (20,7%), destacando el sexo masculino en la vespertinidad.\nComparando las variables estudiadas, los consumidores de alcohol de riesgo tienen mayor dependencia a la nicotina, consumo de tipo binge drinking, se decantan por el cronotipo vespertino, mayor grado de erotofilia y practican actividad fisica de nivel alto. La dependencia a la nicotina y el consumo de tipo binge drinking se relaciona con la erotofilia. El cronotipo matutino se vincula con mayor adherencia alta a la dieta mediterranea.\n 3.conclusion Los datos obtenidos parecen indicar que los universitarios de la Universidad de Cordoba y Castilla La Mancha tienen un alto consumo de riesgo, con un consumo de tipo binge drinking, baja dependencia a la nicotina y alta motivacion para dejar de fumar. La practica de actividad fisica es de nivel alto y tienen alta adherencia a la DM. Opinion y actitud sexual de erotofilia, y cronotipo vespertino en su mayoria. Por otra parte, se relaciona el consumo de riesgo con mayor dependencia a la nicotina, consumo binge drinking, y vespertinidad. El consumo intensivo de alcohol y la dependencia a la nicotina se relacionan con mayor erotofilia, y la matutinidad se relaciona con alta adherencia a la dieta mediterranea.\n 4. bibliografia\n1.

      "abstract": "It is widely believed that addiction entails a loss of free will, even though this point is controversial among scholars. There is arguably a downside to this belief, in that addicts who believe they lack the free will to quit an addiction might therefore fail to quit an addiction.A correlational study tested the relationship between belief in free will and addiction. Follow-up studies tested steps of a potential mechanism: 1) people think drugs undermine free will 2) people believe addiction undermines free will more when doing so serves the self 3) disbelief in free will leads people to perceive various temptations as more addictive.People with lower belief in free will were more likely to have a history of addiction to alcohol and other drugs, and also less likely to have successfully quit alcohol. People believe that drugs undermine free will, and they use this belief to self-servingly attribute less free will to their bad actions than to good ones. Low belief in free will also increases perceptions that things are addictive.Addiction is widely seen as loss of free will. The belief can be used in self-serving ways that may undermine people's efforts to quit.",

      "abstract": "Nicotine, the primary psychoactive agent in tobacco leaves, has led to the widespread use of tobacco, with over one billion smokers globally. This article provides a historical overview of tobacco and discusses tobacco dependence, as well as the biological effects induced by nicotine on mammalian cells. Nicotine induces various biological effects, such as neoangiogenesis, cell division, and proliferation, and it affects neural and non-neural cells through specific pathways downstream of nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). Specific effects mediated by α7 nAChRs are highlighted. Nicotine is highly addictive and hazardous. Public health initiatives should prioritize combating smoking and its associated risks. Understanding nicotine’s complex biological effects is essential for comprehensive research and informed health policies. While potential links between nicotine and COVID-19 severity warrant further investigation, smoking remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Effective public health strategies are vital to promote healthier lifestyles.",

Often (but not always) the liquid and its aerosol vapour contain nictorine,; in these cases, the devices are termed electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).– The use of vaping devices is generally described as a smoking cessation aid for use in the short term only,,–; that is, ENDS and other vaping products are neither recommended for people who do not smoke nor for long-term use in people who smoke and are trying to quit.,Nonetheless, the use of ENDS is increasing rapidly across the world,, particularly among adolescents and younger adults.,,,– Whereas the use of ENDS products in adults generally follows their use of combustible tobacco products (i.e., often used as a cessation aid), use of ENDS products in children, youth, and younger adults often begins before the use of combustible tobacco products, causing concern that ENDS and other vaping products may serve as a “gateway” to the use of combustible tobacco products — especially in younger populations.,,,There is currently limited evidence describing the health effects of ENDS and other vaping products — particularly given the wide variety of available ENDS products — including a lack of data describing associated morbidity and mortality. However, a growing body of literature describes the risk of e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury that can be caused by ENDS devices.,– In addition, there is the risk of toxicity and/or adverse reactions that can be caused by the aerosol vapour, particularly in children and youth., Concerns have also been raised about the insufficiency of current regulatory limitations in place in Canada that govern the distribution, marketing, and use of ENDS.Given the rising use of ENDS and other vaping products, as well as the uncertainty concerning their health effects, there is a need for evidence-based guidance to support vaping cessation. The purpose of this report is to identify and describe evidence-based guidelines to inform the use of pharmacological interventions to support vaping cessation.",

He was noted to have mood disturbances, was seen by a psychogeriatrician who diagnosed bipolar disorder. He tried various bipolar medications including lithium and sodium valproate which was unsuccessful. He was then started on quetiapine 600 mg a day in divided doses. Subsequently this has not only controlled the bipolar disorder but also resulted in significant reduction in alcohol intake.

      "abstract": "Abstract The text explores the negative aspects of dieting. Dieting has been more common in recent years as more people strive to adhere to strict food plans in an effort to achieve their desired body weight and form. Unfortunately, this strategy may have unforeseen repercussions that could have a negative impact on one’s health. Insufficient calorie intake, for instance, might deprive the body of vital nutrients, resulting in malnutrition and a weakened immune system. Similar to too-restricted diets, irregular periods and even infertility can result from a disruption in the hormonal balance. Furthermore, dieting can lead to psychological distress, which in turn promotes disordered eating behaviors such as binge eating, purging, and other eating disorders. These disorders have the potential to have a long-term negative impact on physical and mental health, and in some situations, they may even be fatal. It’s important to exercise caution and knowledge when it comes to various diet regimens that are advertised on social media and online.",

Sie werden millionenfach in Deutschland missbraucht, um von den Alltagsproblemen abzulenken. Seit Jahrzehnten ist bekannt, dass die Mitglieder aus den unteren sozialen Schichten der Gesellschaft mit geringeren beruflichen Qualifizierungen davon zu einem größeren Teil betroffen sind als Menschen mit höheren Schul- und Hochschulabschlüssen. Besondere Zielgruppen für Tabak und Alkohol sind zeitweilig oder langzeitig Arbeitslose sowie allein lebende Menschen. Wenn es um das Rauchen geht, werden Kinder und Frauen davon mehr betroffen als Männer. Die Vereinsamung des Menschen, oft einhergehend mit dem Auftreten depressiver Reaktionen oder von Depressionen, begünstigt den Griff zur Zigarette. Sozial schwache Menschen geben bis zu 20 % ihres Einkommens für Tabakwaren aus. In zahlreichen Industrieländern wird der Zeitpunkt des Rauchbeginns in immer frühere Lebensjahre verlegt, wodurch vermeidbare Erkrankungen in immer früheren Lebensjahren zu beobachten sind. Das bedeutet, dass vermeidbare Erkrankungen über immer längere Zeiträume medizinisch versorgt werden müssen. In den kommenden Jahren müssen wirksame Präventionsprogramme gegen das Rauchen insbesondere für die sozioökonomisch schlecht gestellten Bevölkerungsteile entwickelt werden, um die Finanzierbarkeit der Gesundheitssysteme in den kommenden Jahrzehnten überhaupt noch zu ermöglichen.",

Use of psychoactive substances impacts on academic, social, psychological, economical and physiological development of people with their families negatively. Alcoholic beverages are the most important product of global addiction demand, which is a reason of many deaths and diseases worldwide. Alcohol consumption is a major problem in India because of the various reasons like socio-cultural, difference in alcohol policies and practices state wise, lack of awareness of alcohol related problems, false mass media propaganda, various patterns of alcohol consumption and as a symbol of status both in urban and rural areas across the country. As per people’s opinion, they consumes it because it induces feeling of relaxation and tranquility, suppress anxiety and increases confidence. However with increasing dose, pleasant euphoric starts which means they feels that they are in heaven and that gives way to feelings of depression. That’s why this is called as substance of abuse.

We hypothesized that among females, dieters, compared to nondieters, would report more weight gain after smoking cessation and would tend to smoke more for weight control purpose.Undergraduate college students were surveyed to assess their smoking status, dieting status, postcessation weight gain, and their motivations to smoke.Among former smokers, dieters reported considerably more weight gain than nondieters. Dieters were more likely to have started, and to have continued smoking in order to control their weight, and among current smokers, dieters reported having had shorter quit attempts.The dieters/former smokers' comparatively high weight gain after smoking cessation is discussed in terms of possible changes in dietary intake, metabolic rate, and physical activity.",

Specialists have tried to pinpoint factors like biological science, sex, race, or socioeconomics which will dispose somebody to white plague. however it's no single cause. Psychological, genetic, and behavioural factors will all contribute to having the sickness. It’s necessary to notice that alcoholism may be a real sickness. It will cause changes to the brain and neurochemistry, thus someone with Associate in Nursing white plague might not be ready to management their actions. white plague will show itself in a very type of ways in which. The severity of the sickness, however usually somebody drinks, and also the alcohol they consume varies from person to person. Some individuals drink heavily all day, whereas others binge drink then keep sober for a jiffy. notwithstanding however the addiction appearance, somebody generally has Associate in Nursing white plague if they heavily believe drinking Associate in Nursingd can’t keep sober for an extended amount of your time. Alcohol addiction is troublesome to acknowledge. In contrast to cocain or hard drug, alcohol is wide out there and accepted in several cultures. It’s usually at the middle of social things and closely coupled to celebrations and pleasure. Drinking may be a a part of life for several individuals. once is it common in society, it is exhausting to inform the distinction between somebody United Nations agency likes to possess some drinks currently then and somebody with a true downside. Some symptoms of white plague are: increased amount or frequency of use, high tolerance for alcohol, or lack of “hangover” symptoms, drinking at inappropriate times, like very first thing within the morning, or in places like church or work, desperate to be wherever alcohol is gift and avoiding things wherever there's none, changes in friendships; somebody with Associate in Nursing white plague could select friends United Nations agency additionally drink heavily, avoiding contact with fair-haired ones, activity alcohol, or activity whereas drinking, dependence on alcohol to perform in existence, increased lethargy, depression, or different emotional problems, legal or skilled issues like Associate in Nursing arrest or loss of employment. As Associate in Nursing addiction tends to urge worse over time, it’s necessary to appear for early warning signs. If known and treated early, somebody with Associate in Nursing white plague could also be ready to avoid major consequences of the sickness. If you’re disturbed that somebody you recognize has Associate in Nursing white plague, it’s best to approach them in a very verificatory approach. Avoid shaming them or creating them feel guilty. this might push them away and create them a lot of immune to your facilitate. It's currently proverbial that excess alcohol consumption throughout gestation will cause foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) during which many characteristic craniofacial abnormalities square measure usually visible. However, the molecular mechanisms of however excess ethyl alcohol exposure affects os Neural Crest Cells (CNCCs), the ascendant cells of the os skeleton, continues to be not clear. Within the study, we tend to investigated the results of ethyl alcohol exposure on CNCCs migration each in early chick embryo and in vitro explant culture. 1st of all, we tend to incontestible that ethyl alcohol treatment caused alizarine red-stained craniofacial organic process defects together with membrane bone defect. Second, immunofluorescent staining with neural crest special markers indicated that CNCCs generation was smothered by ethyl alcohol exposure. Double immunofluorescent stainings (Ap-2/PHIS3, HNK1/BrdU and AP-2?/c-caspase3) disclosed that ethyl alcohol exposure smothered CNCCs proliferation and increased cell death. additionally, it smothered NCCs production by restrictive the expression level of key transcription factors that regulate neural crest development by fixing expression of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-related adhesion molecules within the developing neural crests. In sum, we've provided experimental proof that excess ethyl alcohol exposure throughout embryogenesis disrupts CNCCs survival, EMT and migration, that successively causes defective of bone development. Treating white plague is complicated and difficult. So as for treatment to figure, the person with Associate in nursing white plague should wish to urge sober. You can’t force them to prevent drinking if they aren’t prepared. Success depends on the person’s want to urge higher. The recovery method for alcoholism may be a lifespan commitment. There isn’t a fast fix and it involves daily care. For this reason, many of us say white plague isn't “cured.” a typical initial treatment possibility for somebody with Associate in Nursing white plague is Associate in Nursing patient or inmate program. Associate in Nursing inmate program will last anyplace from thirty days to a year. It will facilitate somebody handle withdrawal symptoms and emotional challenges. Patient treatment provides daily support whereas permitting the person to measure reception. Somebody with Associate in Nursing white plague may like different treatments including: drug medical care, counseling, nutritionary changes. Medical care is beneficial to assist teach somebody the way to manage the strain of recovery and also the skills required to forestall a relapse. Also, a healthy diet will facilitate undo injury alcohol could have done to the person’s health, like weight gain or loss. White plague could involve many completely different treatment strategies. It’s necessary that every person become involved in a very recovery program that may support long-run sobriety. This might mean a stress on medical care for somebody United Nations agency is depressed, or inmate treatment for somebody with severe withdrawal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is generally regarded as a form of nicotine dependence, but the evidence for this is slender. Two experiments are described here which examine the hypothesis that habitual smokers need nicotine and that they regulate their intakes of this drug. A laboratory test for smoking was devised which permitted the continuous monitoring of puffing as well as of selected physiologic variables; the procedure was also designed to reduce the influence of smoking habits and rituals. In the first experiment, inhaled amounts of tobacco smoke reduced subsequent ad libitum smoking in a dose-related way. In the second experiment comparable doses of nicotine were given intravenously to the same subjects, but they failed to affect ongoing smoking. However, both the inhaled and intravenous doses of the drug produced very similar physiologic effects. These experiments do not, therefore, support the nicotine-dependence hypothesis; thus the ways, if any, in which this drug sustains the tobacco-smoking habit merit further examination.",

      "title": "Exploring young people's concepts of smoking addiction: Perceived opportunities to try smoking without becoming addicted",
      "abstract": "This study explores how young people conceptualise addiction to smoking and, also the relationship between young people's addiction beliefs and intentions to smoke cigarettes. Addiction to smoking is a major health problem, not just for adults, but also for young smokers, up to 60% of whom are dependent on nicotine. However, anti-smoking prevention efforts targeted at young people generally emphasise ill-health effects and little attention is paid to addiction education which is generally considered relevant only to adult smoking and cessation efforts. Perhaps as a consequence, young people appear to have many misconceptions and unrealistic ideas about addiction, and these may possibly have influenced initial decisions to take up smoking. For example, between 50% and 60% of young smokers believe that it would be easy or very easy to stop smoking altogether if and when they choose to and the majority of daily smokers mistakenly believe that they will not be smoking for more than five years. For these young smokers, becoming addicted is often an unforeseen consequence and most are surprised to find that they cannot give up smoking as easily as they thought. The majority of addicted smokers regret ever taking up smoking but nevertheless continue to smoke cigarettes for perhaps 30 to 40 years because they find it very difficult to stop. This backdrop provides the impetus for the present study.",

Special considerations for adolescent smoking cessation treatment include peer influences, motivation, and nicotine dependence. Little research has addressed smoking cessation treatment for youth with AOD use disorders, but the few available studies suggest that tobacco cessation efforts are feasible and potentially effective for this population. Findings to date suggest that adolescents with AOD use disorders may benefit more from relatively intensive multicomponent programs rather than brief treatment for smoking cessation. Additional research is needed to further address the inclusion of tobacco-specific interventions for adolescents in AOD use disorder treatment programs.",

      "title": "Do Maladaptive Schemas Put Young People at Risk for Addiction?",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nThe use of psychoactive drugs is a wide spread phenomenon which occurs in virtually all cultures of the world. Most people who consume psychoactive substances may control their consumption well over their whole life span and even draw benefits from it (1). In a minority of the users, however, controlled drug use can make a transition to drug addiction. This is a psychiatric disorder which requires treatment, or even better, prevention. Although drug use is the ‘conditio sine qua none’ of developing drug addiction, there are additional factors that contribute significantly to the risk. There are genetic (2) and epigenetic factors (3, 4), and there are environmental factors. These environmental factors may be further distinguished in passively incurred and actively developed factors (5). Passively incurred factors may be the experience of a natural disaster or a major private loss, which may then trigger the escalation of drug consumption. But there are also actively developed environmental factors. One group of them is the schemas that people form. These are patterns of beliefs and thoughts about oneself, others, and the environment, which shape how we perceive our environment, how we form memories and how we generate behavior. These schemas are acquired starting in early life. They can be helpful or maladaptive. Young et al. (6) had identified eighteen maladaptive schemas which were grouped in five areas: 1) disconnection/rejection, 2) impaired autonomy/performance, 3) impaired limits, 4) other directedness and 5) over vigilance/inhibition. These schemas are believed to foster negative experiences in life and produce a rather insufficient coping with psychological pressure. Positive schemas, in contrast, allow people to experience more positive experiences and allow for a better coping with stressful life events. Previous studies have shown that an enhanced rate of early established maladaptive schemas is found in drug users (7, 8). While genetic, epigenetic and also passively incurred environmental factors can only explain a small proportion of the addiction risk, it is currently unclear which role actively developed factors might play.\r\n\r\nBakhshi Bojed and Nikmanesh asked in their study whether the establishment of maladaptive schemas increases addiction potential of young people and whether these early maladaptive schemas can predict addiction potential. To address this question they investigated 260 students (159 females, 101 males) of the University of Sistan and Baluchestan in the year 2011-12. They were all young adults 19-25 years of age. All subjects were administered the Addiction Potential Scale questionnaire to evaluate current addiction potential. In order to measure early maladaptive schemas, the young schema questionnaire – short form was used. The main finding of this study was a significant positive correlation between addiction potential and all of the five areas of early maladaptive schemas (disconnection/rejection, impaired autonomy and performance, Impaired limits, other-directedness and over vigilance/inhibition). In a regression analysis the authors identified the schema of disconnection/rejection as the most influential factor, which alone determined already 0.16 of the variance in the addiction potential. Together with the schemas ‘impaired autonomy’ and ‘other-directedness’ it explained 0.19 of the variance (9). These findings clearly suggest that there is a strong relationship between early maladaptive schemas and the addiction potential in young adults. Maladaptive schemas are established early in life often by family interactions. In fact, offspring copies the schemas of parents, family members or even peers. This may explain why there is a high inheritance of the addiction risk (10), but only a small part of it appears genetically or epigenetically transmitted. As the present study shows, an increasingly big role might be played by inherited schemas, where children simply copy maladaptive schemas of their parents. Maladaptive schemas not only predict addiction as it was shown in previous studies (7, 8), but already the addiction potential. Thus, they may well suit as screening instruments to identify people at increased risk of addiction and may allow focusing prevention programs in the future.",

      "abstract": "The popularity of energy drinks has surged in recent years, becoming a common alternative to coffee, tea, or soda. Designed to enhance physical performance, they promise a quick energy boost, improved mood, and increased focus. However, excessive consumption is linked to serious health risks. Overconsumption of energy drinks can lead to arrhythmia, seizures, tachycardia, and even death. Chronic consumption can result in elevated blood pressure, psycho-physical disorders, and addiction. Children, adolescents, and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable. A worrying trend is the mixing of energy drinks with alcohol, which amplifies the risk of adverse health effects. Marketing tactics promoting energy drinks at major events and featuring athletes and musicians have increased their appeal, especially among teenagers. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend, with younger individuals turning to these drinks to cope with stress and isolation. Addressing this issue requires educating adolescents and raising awareness about the consequences of excessive consumption. Establishing safe doses of energy drink ingredients and thoroughly documenting their side effects is crucial.",

      "title": "The Four-Loko Effect",
      "abstract": "There have been recent reports of mass hospitalizations for alcohol intoxication following consumption of fruit-flavored, caffeinated, alcoholic drinks—especially concerning one brand in particular: Four Loko. Caffeine was quickly determined to be the culprit. In accordance with a directive by the Food and Drug Administration, caffeine was removed from Four Loko and similar beverages. However, the evidence that caffeine played a prominent role in widespread displays of intoxication is far from clear. Rather, it is likely that Four Loko-type drinks are especially effective as intoxicants because they provide alcohol in an unusual context. It has been known for many years that drug tolerance partially results from an association between drug-paired stimuli and the drug effect. When these stimuli are altered, the drug-experienced individual does not display the expected tolerant response to the drug—rather, an enhanced (i.e., nontolerant) response is seen. Four Loko and similar beverages may be especially effective intoxicants because they provide a very novel flavor context for alcohol. A recent announcement by the manufacturer of Four Loko suggests (either by design or happenstance) appreciation of the contribution of alcohol-associated cues to alcohol tolerance.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes: Do They Have Any Role in Tobacco Control?",
      "abstract": "Introduction: and objective: E-cigarettes -an entity, unheard of until a few years ago, has taken up the market in a big way. They are being aggressively marketed all over the world, are being increasingly used by smokers as well as new vapers because of its easy availability and no regulation on its sale or use. These gadgets come in nearly 250 varieties and are being frequently upgraded. Methods: The promoters of e-cigs claim that it exposes the user and persons around them to much lesser degrees of nicotine and other chemicals, which is definitely far less toxic then the cigarette smoke. It is less likely to cause the health hazards-mainly cardiovascular, cancer and lung diseases as compared with cigarettes. However, no detail study has been done to clearly show the amount of nicotine absorbed and the health hazards of these noncombustibles, toxic substances have been found to be present in e-cig vapors, but again the level is very low. Results: People are worried, that this may become a starting point, the gateway of smoking for the young generation. The youngsters are easily attracted to newer, cool things and with no regulation on its advertisements, the use among youth is definitely going up. Down the line these people just remain e-cig user or easily switch to smoking cigarettes, only the time will tell. But the likelihood of this is very high. Many are using cigarettes and e-cigarettes in tandem. Conclusions: Unlicensed, unregulated e-cigarettes fail to meet standards of safety, quality and efficacy and therefore health professionals in India, as of now, do not recommend e-cigs for quitting.",

      "title": "Motivational Interview; Evidence Based Strategy In The Treatment of Alcohol And Drug Addiction",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONWhat is Drug Addiction?To answer above question, considerations are given to what is meant by drugs and when addiction could be said to have taken place. The drugs of concern here are psychoactive drugs.Psychoactive drugs are substances that when ingested interact with the CNS to affect the individual's thoughts, feelings and actions. They affect one's mental process and behavior, perception of reality, level of alertness, response time and perception of the world. WHO 1998 defined Psychoactive drugs as chemical substance which, when taken into the body, alters its function physically and /or psychologically. Ikpeme (2010) specifically described it as any substance people consider to be a drug, with the understanding that this will change from culture to culture and from time to time. This definition supposes that psychoactive drugs vary from place to place and from time - do you agree? Does the fact that opium has transformed into a household name in china change its effect on their people who use it and get hooked on it? Or had our acceptance and celebration of alcohol in anyway negate its powerful and damaging effect on our local population especially the youths? However, culture must be considered in order to understand people's affiliation to a particular drug and to achieve effective treatment.Drug addiction is a direct consequence of continued or prolonged use of these substances for the varied purposes of pleasure, stress/pain amelioration, social/educational disadvantages, peer pressure, experimental use, etc. After years of research and practice in addiction treatment, emphasis continues to be laid on physical causes of addiction. In this view, genetic factors increase the likelihood for an individual to misuse psychoactive substances or to lose control when using them. Neurochemical changes in the brain resulting from substance use then induce continuing consumption, as does the development of physiological dependence (CSAT, 1991). Other theories on the causes or reasons for addictive behavior include spiritual emptiness and meaninglessness, deficits in learning, emotional dysfunction, or psychopathology; other factors are socioeconomic status, cultural and ethnic beliefs, availability of substances, laws and penalties regulating substance use, the norms and rules of families and other social groups as well as parental and peer expectations, modeling of acceptable behaviors, and presence or absence of reinforcers.Despite all these, over the past decade, substantial research and clinical attention have revealed a more complex relationship between psychiatric and substance abuse disorders and symptoms. Specifically, substance use can cause psychiatric symptoms and mimic psychiatric disorders; substance use can prompt or worsen the severity of psychiatric disorders; substance use can mask psychiatric disorders and symptoms; withdrawal from severe substance dependence can precipitate psychiatric disorders; psychiatric and substance abuse disorders can coexist; and psychiatric disorders can produce behaviors that mimic ones associated with substances use problems (CSAT, 1994; Landiy et al., 1991).Behavioral psychologists have explained substance use as a learned behavior that is repeated in direct relation to the quality, number, and intensity of reinforces that follow each episode of use (McAuliffe and Gordon, 1980). It is on the principle that reinforced behaviors would be repeated that addiction is based. Substance abusers are positively reinforced initially by the drugs of interest themselves and then by their powerful effect on the central nervous system. Addicts can also be positively reinforced by social factors such as peer group acceptance, notoriety, etc. negative reinforces include lessened anxiety, pain or stress and elimination of withdrawal symptoms.Hence, drug addiction is a complex illness characterized by compulsive, and at times, uncontrollable drug craving, seeking, and use that persist even in the face of extreme negative consequences (TREATNET, 2008). …",

      "abstract": "Excessive drinking is common in Western societies and leads to a wide range of physical, psychological and social problems. These problems are costly to society. The 1-year prevalence of dependence is 4–5% and lifetime prevalence 13–16%. A wide range of pharmacological approaches to attenuate drinking or promote abstinence has been studied. Clinical research in this area has been affected by poor methodological quality, with some important exceptions and there is a need for agreed standards of research conduct. Nevertheless, several pharmacological agents have emerged as having potential. Acamprosate (a synthetic GABA analog) and naltrexone (an opioid anatagonist) have some evidence of efficacy in excessive drinking and alcohol dependence. However, precise mechanisms of effect and identification of drinkers most likely to benefit have still to be established.",

Metodologia O documento foi construído após uma revisão teórica sobre o tabaco e seus efeitos tóxicos aos seres humanos. O levantamento bibliográfico foi realizado utilizando-se as bases de dados PubMed, Lilacs, Scielo e Google Acadêmico. Resultado: o tabaco é uma mistura de aproximadamente 4.700 substâncias tóxicas que se distribuem em duas fases de compostos de elevado grau de toxicidade; abordamos a Nicotina e sua alta capacidade de gerar dependência; buscamos informar a dificuldade que um indivíduo tem de a abolir o hábito, pelo qual a nicotina produz efeitos que reforçam o seu uso. A severidade da dependência a nicotina pode ser ilustrada com o fato de que apenas 33% das pessoas que deixam de fumar sozinhas permanecem abstinentes por um período superior a 2 dias, e menos de 5% mantém-se abstinentes por mais de 1 ano. Conclusão: os avanços no controle do tabagismo dependem de uma visão de futuro baseada em metas, estratégias e rigidez nas políticas antitabagistas.",

O III Levantamento Nacional sobre o Uso de Drogas revela que 66,4% dos brasileiros entre 12 e 65 anos já consumiram álcool, e 33,5% já usaram tabaco, com alta prevalência entre adolescentes. Além disso, 15 milhões de indivíduos admitiram o uso de drogas ilícitas. Entretanto, o uso, abuso e dependência de drogas, apesar de frequentemente usados como sinônimos, têm definições distintas. O consumo abusivo pode evoluir para o Transtorno de Uso de Substâncias (TUS), que envolve a perda de controle sobre o consumo e a compulsão pela droga. Fatores genéticos, ambientais e as características da substância influenciam na vulnerabilidade ao vício. Este artigo discute a neuroquímica das drogas de abuso, destacando o papel da dopamina e do sistema de recompensa no desenvolvimento da adicção, além de discutir três das principais drogas utilizadas no Brasil, o álcool, a nicotina e a cocaína/crack. A compreensão desses mecanismos é essencial para enfrentar os desafios associados ao consumo de drogas no Brasil.",

      "abstract": "Although tobacco use by both men and women has been documented throughout history,', , two technological developments in the 19th century radically and irreversibly changed societal patterns of nicotine use. First, the introduction of flue-curing yielded a product with a lower pH and milder smoke that could be readily inhaled through the lungs, producing a rapid rise of nicotine in plasma that appears to contribute to the reinforcing and addictive properties of nicotine by partially overcoming tolerance, and delivering nicotine via a process that maximizes exposure to carcinogens. Second, the invention by a Virginian named James Bonsack of a cigaret-rolling machine, which could turn out as many cigarets as could 40 workers rolling manually, made that product widely and cheaply available. With these innovations, tobacco use was fairly quickly transformed from a somewhat distasteful and unhealthful habit, alternately lauded and reviled, to what is arguably the most critical public health problem we face today.

      "abstract": "The invention of mass marketing led to cigarettes being emblazoned in advertising and film, deeply tied to modern notions of glamour and sex appeal. It is hard to find a photo of Humphrey Bogart or Lauren Bacall without a cigarette. No product has been so heavily promoted or has become so deeply entrenched in American consciousness. And no product has received such sustained scientific scrutiny. The development of new medical knowledge demonstrating the dire harms of smoking ultimately shaped the evolution of evidence-based medicine. In response, the tobacco industry engineered a campaign of scientific disinformation seeking to delay, disrupt, and suppress these studies. Using a massive archive of previously secret documents, historian Allan Brandt shows how the industry pioneered these campaigns, particularly using special interest lobbying and largesse to elude regulation. But even as the cultural dominance of the cigarette has waned and consumption has fallen dramatically in the U. S. , Big Tobacco remains securely positioned to expand into new global markets. The implications for the future are vast: 100 million people died of smoking-related diseases in the 20th century; in the next 100 years, we expect 1 billion deaths worldwide.",

In Australia, the incidence of these drugs is similar to the prevalence of alcohol in fatal crashes. The drugs of highest prevalence are cannabis, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), opiates and the benzodiazepines. Similar prevalence of one or more of these drug classes ahs been observed in other jurisdictions. These drugs are capable of adversely affecting driving ability. In particular, the greatest evidence of an adverse effect on road safety exists for ATS, benzodiazepines and cannabis in its various forms. Although older drivers do not have a high or even significant incidence of drink driving or illicit drug use, they do take many prescribed medications that can have an effect on driving ability.",

But the way that most of us take a hit of pot needlessly takes a hit on our health. It is high time for health-conscious cannabis consumers to learn a new way of smoking that reduces its risks. In Mindful Marijuana Smoking, Mark Mathew Braunstein offers sound advice on every phase of the cannabis smoking experience, presenting health tips based on solid science. Whether with rolling papers, hand pipes, waterpipes, or herbal vaporizers, each method of cannabinoid delivery has both risks and rewards. Chapters are devoted to each method so that you can learn how to maximize their benefits and reduce their hazards, as well as how to protect your health even before you take a puff. And once you’ve inhaled the smoke, this book assures you that you don’t need to hold your breath to reap all the benefits of cannabis. Additionally, this book teaches readers how to assure an herb’s purity, as both black market and corporate cannabis keep dirty secrets about how they were grown, and readers will learn about the potential impurities in rolling papers and vaping oils. The stronger the dose, the less you need to toke, so you’ll find instructions on how to properly store cannabis to retain its potency. Finally, after you’ve smoked, you’ll find guidance on why and how to relieve your parched mouth and to replenish nutrients that are depleted by smoking. Potheads and patients, tenderfoot tokers and seasoned stoners, dabbling dilettantes and cannabis connoisseurs, all need to read this book. By following its many health tips, when you light up, you can lighten up.",

Notre etude, realisee sur un echantillon representatif de 446 etudiants residant dans le campus de l’universite de Dakar, avait pour but de mesurer la prevalence de l’usage du cannabis au sein de cette population et d’en decrire les principaux facteurs associes. Au terme de l’etude, la prevalence retrouvee est de 19,7 %. L’usage du cannabis commence relativement tot, vers 16‐17 ans. Les jeunes usagers sont generalement inities par un proche et sont motives par la curiosite lors de leur premiere experience. Le fait que l’etudiant dispose ou non d’une bourse d’etude, de meme que sa faculte d’inscription, n’influencent pas l’usage du cannabis. En revanche, la religion jouerait un role determinant, les Chretiens semblant etre plus touches que les Musulmans (p ∓ 0,026). Notre prevalence est similaire a celle mesuree au Kenya en milieu etudiant, mais nettement inferieure aux prevalences retrouvees dans les pays developpes.

      "abstract": "Abstract Most parents would find it impossible to give a straight answer to that question. They might perhaps say that they would be very unhappy about their child drinking at 13 years of age, but feel quite relaxed about it by the time their child was at the end of the teens. But the way they behave to their children makes it likely that their attitudes are a great deal more complicated than that would suggest. Many parents who would be horrified if their 13-year-old went to a party where unlimited alcohol was on offer would think it quite normal to let their child have a glass of wine when the family was having a celebratory meal at home. And why not? In contrast, they would probably not feel at all relaxed if their 19-year-old son or daughter was frequently drunk, drinking to relieve feelings of depression, getting into fights while drunk, or having unprotected sex with numerous different partners while drunk. So the answer to the question about how parents feel about their children and alcohol is not straightforward. Clearly the age of the child in question is a major consideration, but so is the amount drunk and the circumstances in which drinking is taking place.",

The idea that alcoholism is a discrete entity has been undermined by a second major line of advance — the survey investigation of population drinking practices. In any culture where alcohol is an accepted recreational drug, dependence on alcohol is in a statistical sense a normal condition -most people will have some degree of drive toward seeking alcohol actuated by a variety of external or internal cues. Traditionally a distinction has been made between psychological dependence and physical dependence. In Anglo-Saxon literature the 'psychopathic' alcoholic is a familiar stereotype. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms are typically experienced on waking, but with the highly dependent person careful questioning may reveal that he experiences sub-acute withdrawal during the day, or indeed wakes during the night disturbed by withdrawal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Around 200,000 people in England are being treated for substance dependence. However, since most illicit drug use is covert, this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. When drug use becomes drug dependence, it can lead to physical and mental harm for the user, can have a knock-on effect that damages relationships and family life, and can generate extensive health and criminal justice costs. Furthermore, social exclusion of drug misusers can reduce the likelihood of them engaging with healthcare services.",

      "title": "Alcohol's Role in Work-Force Entry and Retirement.",
      "abstract": "Employment and drinking behavior interact in intriguing ways both upon entrance to and departure from the labor force. Teenagers who work are more likely to drink than their unemployed peers, possibly offsetting the expected advantages of gaining early job experience. For young people in general, early heavy drinking can curtail continuing education and stifle opportunities for career advancement. At the opposite end of the age spectrum, some retirees may turn to alcohol to fill leisure time and cope with the stresses associated with retirement as a major life change. Other retirees, however, may cut back on drinking once they are freed from job-related stress, leave a work environment that encourages alcohol use, or experience financial constraints. Although tolerance to alcohol's effects wanes with advancing age, older adults who remain employed are more apt than retirees to drink heavily. Alternatively, older workers may decide to restrict their drinking to keep pace with younger colleagues.",

Section 7.2 considers alcohol, its behavioural effects and how these might arise in the brain. Consequences of chronic use on brain and behaviour are also examined, both for adult neurological sequelae and for foetal brain development. Section 7.3 explores caffeine and theobromine, the former being the world’s most widely used drug. Whether caffeine’s cognitive-behavioural benefits arise from it ameliorating withdrawal in chronic users or whether it has some cognitive enhancing properties in everyone is examined. The biological basis of these cognitive-behavioural effects are also reviewed, including how caffeine may affect striatal dopamine. Section 7.5 examines food addiction. A number of conceptual issues are discussed, namely obesity as an endpoint of addiction, whether there can be addiction to a biological need, and the appropriateness of parallels to substance abuse and behavioural models of addiction.",

      "abstract": "Energy drinks are increasingly popular among athletes and others. Advertising for these products typically features images conjuring great muscle power and endurance; however, the scientific literature provides sparse evidence for an ergogenic role of energy drinks. Although the composition of energy drinks varies, most contain caffeine; carbohydrates, amino acids, herbs, and vitamins are other typical ingredients. This report analyzes the effects of energy drink ingredients on prolonged submaximal (endurance) exercise as well as on short-term strength and power (neuromuscular performance). It also analyzes the effects of energy drink ingredients on the fluid and electrolyte deficit during prolonged exercise. In several studies, energy drinks have been found to improve endurance performance, although the effects could be attributable to the caffeine and/or carbohydrate content. In contrast, fewer studies find an ergogenic effect of energy drinks on muscle strength and power. The existing data suggest that the caffeine dose given in studies of energy drinks is insufficient to enhance neuromuscular performance. Finally, it is unclear if energy drinks are the optimal vehicle to deliver caffeine when high doses are needed to improve neuromuscular performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Utilisation of tobacco is one of the most serious problems affecting human health worldwide, despite the fact that the early fatality caused by tobacco use are growing, regardless of the fact that it is avoidable tobacco consumption is very common, considerable resources have been allocated to this issue. On tobacco prevention, a range of strategies have been tested but the ratio of death due to tobacco and number of tobacco consumers is increasing day by day. Various impediments to tobacco quitting have been recognized, all of which contribute to the failure of various tobacco cessation programs and methodologies. Individuals in the India have attempted or considered quitting smoking at some point in their lives but ended in failure. Existing tobacco cessation programs have not out-turned in a decrease in the figure of tobacco users or deaths, necessitating a new strategy. Tobacco cessation on prescription, developed from physical activity on prescription (PAP), can be a useful method in terms of public health. But yet no studies have ever been conducted over this. Further studies on this can explore results of tobacco quitting after prescription from general physician or other medical practitioner, evaluative beliefs about tobacco consumption and barriers in quitting even after prescription. Hence the present review was done with explore the outcomes for cessation of tobacco based upon utilization of tobacco cessation by prescription (TCP) methodology in Indian scenario. This review paper focuses on TCP as a need for newer approach pertaining to Indian perspective. Future study should look at whether raising the rate of stop attempts are improving the tobacco cessation rate in the general population after the implementation of TCP.",

Smoking is a major health issue in this population, but is often overlooked by health professionals.This article examines the relationship between smoking and depression, and reviews the evidence for the use of specific therapies in general practice.All patients with depression should be asked if they smoke. Smokers with depression have higher nicotine dependence and, after quitting, experience more severe negative moods and are at increased risk of major depression. However, they are motivated to quit and many achieve long term abstinence. Effective strategies for smoking cessation in this population include cognitive behavioural mood management, nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion. Additional support and longer courses of treatment may be needed. Smokers with depression should be monitored for mood changes after quitting. Preventive antidepressants may have a role in high-risk cases, especially for those with recurrent depression.",

      "abstract": "For many individuals in treatment for cocaine dependence, weight gain is a substantial problem during recovery. This weight gain causes significant distress and seems to increase the risk of relapse. The mechanisms underlying cocaine's effects on weight remain elusive. It is widely assumed that this weight gain reflects a metabolic or behavioural compensatory response to the cessation of cocaine use. Here we challenge this assumption and outline potential mechanisms by which chronic cocaine use produces disturbances in the regulation of fat intake and storage, through its effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems, specifically the sympathetic nervous system. We hypothesize that the cocaine-induced alteration in fat regulation results in cocaine users developing a pronounced appetite for fatty food but keeps their fat mass low. This altered fat appetite subsequently leads to excessive weight gain when individuals enter treatment and stop using cocaine. Our aim is to shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie the alterations in eating and fat regulation in cocaine-dependent individuals, to open up potential new avenues to support these individuals in recovery.",

The heavy users of alcohol should be identified both by the general practitioners and the hospital doctors in any field and the first intervention should be a health interview connected with a biological monitoring of alcohol damages and thereby many patients would be motivated for moderate drinking. If this is not the case, heavy users should be encouraged to a 6 or better a 12 months supervised treatment with Antabuse. This treatment has especially been effective in employees with work‐related alcohol problems.",

      "abstract": "Le tabagisme est la cause de longues maladies, responsables chaque annee de 6 millions de deces. Le principal composant du tabac, la nicotine, est l'un des psychotropes les plus addictifs. L’abandon du tabac est difficile et les pharmacotherapies les plus efficaces, telles que la varenicline, ne viennent en aide qu’a une proportion limitee des 70% de fumeurs qui souhaitent stopper. Des etudes cliniques et precliniques ont demontre que plusieurs mecanismes psychopharmacologiques differents contribuent au maintien de la prise de nicotine. Des donnees psychologiques, genetiques et neurobiologiques, issues d’etudes cliniques, indiquent desormais que le poids respectif de ces mecanismes psychopharmacologiques pourrait varier d’un fumeur a l’autre. Cette heterogeneite pourrait contribuer a l’inegale efficacite de la varenicline, dont les cibles psychopharmacologiques sont encore mal connues, ainsi qu’a la faible validite predictive des modeles precliniques, qui ne tiennent pas compte de cette possible heterogeneite individuelle. Dans ce travail de these, au moyen de l’auto-administration intraveineuse de nicotine chez le rat, nous avons explore les variations individuelles dans la sensibilite aux effets renforcants primaires de la nicotine et aux effets de la nicotine sur la sensibilite aux effets renforcants de stimuli environnementaux associes. Nous avons mis en evidence trois sous-populations d'individus dont la recherche de nicotine est controlee par une contribution differente de ces deux types d’effets de la nicotine. Les phenotypes de ces sous-populations ont ete valides par des marqueurs comportementaux preexistants a la consommation de nicotine (l’approche conditionnee pavlovienne), par des marqueurs du metabolisme de la nicotine et des marqueurs neurobiologiques des neurotransmissions cholinergique et dopaminergique dans des structures cerebrales cles. En parallele, nous avons explore les cibles psychopharmacologiques de la varenicline. En utilisant une nouvelle approche qui permet de manipuler, pendant l’autoadministration, les effets de la nicotine sur les effets renforcants d’un stimulus environnemental associe, nous avons montre que la varenicline antagonise a la fois ces effets de la nicotine et ses effets renforcants primaires. Neanmoins, dans le premier cas, la varenicline agit d’autant plus que la sensibilite individuelle aux effets de la nicotine est elevee, alors que l’intensite de son effet ne depend pas de l’amplitude des effets renforcants primaires de la nicotine. Ce travail de these met en evidence et valide des variations individuelles dans les mecanismes qui regissent le comportement de recherche de nicotine dans un modele preclinique. Il offre pour perspective d'explorer les mecanismes neurobiologiques responsables de ces variations individuelles et l’impact a long terme de ces variations sur le developpement de la dependance a la nicotine, ainsi que de tester si la varenicline est plus efficace chez l’une des sous-populations identifiees.",

Although the Home Office has documented that cannabis use in the UK has declined in the last couple of years, the last decade has seen increasing popularity in the use of synthetic cannabinoids (known as ‘spice’). These are marketed online as innocuous herbal products. Several authors have provided evidence to suggest that cannabis use (including ‘spice’) is a cause of mental illness, in particular psychosis and schizophrenia. Certain studies suggest that cannabis accounts for 8–14% of schizophrenia cases, however, the presence of this link remains controversial.

      "title": "E-cigarettes for tobacco cessation",
      "abstract": "NPs practicing in primary care frequently encounter patients who use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), some for the purpose of tobacco cessation. Research shows that clinician involvement in tobacco cessation increases the likelihood of success, and the desire to quit appears to be the strongest predictive factor for successful cessation.1,2 Patients seeking evidence-based assistance regarding tobacco cessation, such as nicotine replacement or cessation medication, are two to three times more likely to quit than those who do not.3 Despite the common belief that ENDS products, which include e-cigarettes, tank systems, and other vaping devices, are suitable for tobacco cessation, they are not recommended for this purpose because of health risks and lack of FDA approval, among other reasons. NPs can positively impact their patients' ability to achieve cessation from smoking and other tobacco products without the use of ENDS, and many resources are available to aid them in this process. It has been known since at least 1988 that nicotine is the addictive substance in tobacco.4 Nicotine reaches the brain within seconds of taking a puff and increases the release of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, that regulate mood and behavior.5 Dopamine is released in the reward center of the brain, resulting in improved mood and pleasant feelings. Over time, neuronal changes occur; thus, nicotine addiction is a chronic neurologic disorder frequently requiring treatment to overcome.6 When ENDS were introduced, it was speculated that the devices could be a powerful tool for tobacco cessation by providing a safer alternative to cigarettes, with the allure of a smoking-like behavior replacement. The liquid used with ENDS, sometimes referred to as e-liquid, produces a harmful aerosol when heated that is inhaled by users and involuntarily inhaled by nonusers.3,7,8 E-liquids usually contain nicotine, and more than half of the people who start using ENDS for tobacco cessation transfer their nicotine dependence to ENDS, often becoming dual users.3,9,10 ENDS use among adolescents is associated with increased initiation of cigarette smoking and increased frequency and intensity of both regular cigarette and e-cigarette usage.11 ENDS product use among adolescents leads to increased dependence on nicotine products.10 After years of market availability, three separate clinical guidelines recommend against the use of ENDs for tobacco cessation because of quality control concerns, insufficient data to demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the risks, and the availability of effective cessation tools. This article examines why ENDS products are not an effective, safe, or approved means of cessation for either adults or adolescents. ENDS products Youth cigarette usage has been steadily declining in recent years, but tobacco use rates remain stubbornly fixed at approximately 20% because noncigarette forms of tobacco, primarily ENDs, are increasingly used by adolescents and young adults.12 In 2020, 19.6% of high-school students in the US reported using ENDS, along with 4.7% of middle-school students.12,13 With 8.2% and 2.8% of high-school and middle-school students, respectively, reporting use of multiple tobacco products, it is clear that many youth are becoming addicted to nicotine by starting with ENDS use alone.13 Nonetheless, polytobacco use (using more than one tobacco product) is increasingly common as the market popularity of ENDS products has increased. Polytobacco users are more likely to report dependence, elucidated as early-morning cravings.12 Notably, attempts to quit among polytobacco users have been higher than cigarette-only users, suggesting that e-cigarette users are employing e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.14 The FDA regulates ENDS.15 However, ENDS products are not FDA-approved for smoking cessation. There are several FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) for this purpose, including three that are available over the counter (nicotine patches [Nicoderm CQ, Habitrol, and generic versions], nicotine lozenges [Nicorette and generic versions], and nicotine gum [Nicorette and generic versions]), and four by prescription, including two nonnicotine oral drugs (bupropion [Zyban] and varenicline [Chantix]), a nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS), and nicotine inhalers (Nicotrol). Nicotine replacement dosage calculation is based on the patient's specific nicotine consumption, such as the number of cigarettes smoked and/or time to first morning cigarette, to ensure minimal withdrawal during the cessation process. Thus, there are ample well-tested FDA-approved products available for cessation. Quality control concerns At this time, there is no legally required quality control of ENDS products; therefore, these products are manufactured without FDA oversight of quality, according to D. Jenson, Lead Senior Staff Attorney for Federal Regulation, Public Health Law Center, Mitchell Hamline School of Law (e-mail communication, December 18, 2020). Three important quality control issues are highlighted, including inaccuracy of nicotine content, compounding-in-shop (CIS) processes of e-liquids, and FDA involvement. Inaccurate nicotine content. The American E-Liquid Manufacturing Standards Association (AEMSA) states that the nicotine content of all products containing e-liquids must be within 10% of the labeled amount.16 Almost half of the studies in a systematic review of e-liquid nicotine content found inaccurate nicotine labeling of ENDS products, with some samples varying more than 100% from the label.17-21 - ENDS use-associated risks ENDS factors compromising cessation efforts Lack of proven tobacco cessation efficacy Inability to accurately dose nicotine for tobacco cessation (risk of nicotine withdrawal and/or nicotine-related adverse reactions) Lack of quality control oversight Inaccurate nicotine content Inconsistencies of in-shop compounding and labeling Direct risks of ENDS use Youth exposure to nicotine Unknown safety of inhaling e-liquid additives Risk of acute e-liquid nicotine poisoning E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury Device battery fires/explosions The authors' 2019 study supports these findings, with only 3.8% of the 238 e-liquid samples meeting AEMSA guidelines.18,22 This cross-sectional study replicated and expanded on the authors' 2015 study assessing free-base, nicotine salt (salt), and 0-mg nicotine e-liquids from a variety of North Dakota shop types to determine nicotine content accuracy.22 The authors also examined the nicotine content of CIS samples. The CIS definition was adapted from Ribisl and colleagues and was specified as either an e-liquid made entirely on site or a premade liquid to which the shop staff added extra nicotine.23 Discrete data collection was completed in 35 (92.1%) of the shops meeting the criteria. Shop types were categorized as vape shops (n = 16, 45.7%), head shops with vaping products (n = 10, 28.6%), tobacco shops (n = 6, 17.1%), and other shops (n = 3, 8.6%). This study used discreet sampling methods so as to not alter the behavior of people in public places, such as the manager, workers, and patrons; therefore, data collectors acted as normal paying customers. Of the e-liquids (n = 285) purchased, 164 (57.5%) were free-base, 80 (28.1%) were salts, and 41 (14.4%) were identified as not containing any nicotine. The mean actual nicotine content was 34% below the labeled content, ranging from 93% below to 213% above the indicated content.22 None of the 25 CIS samples met the AEMSA guideline. In one shop, six samples were not labeled for nicotine content. When asked, the shop staff stated that all six contained the same nicotine content. However, the actual content ranged from just under 6 mg/mL to almost 20 mg/mL. CIS processes. CIS processes were observed during our 2019 study.22 CIS ingredients included nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. Vape shop staff used imprecise methods in compounding e-liquids, including visually estimating quantities of ingredients added. In one-third (two of six) of the shops where CIS processes were observed, shop staff did not relabel the nicotine content of the liquids. In one case, the nicotine content was increased from 0 mg/mL to 12 mg/mL without relabeling the bottle. Other labeling concerns included e-liquids sold without any labels, past their labeled expiration dates, and without an ingredient list.24 Another unprofessional practice included one shop being adjacent to a fish breeding room. Because of the inconsistencies in compounding and labeling, users cannot assume accuracy of e-liquid nicotine content. This has implications for individuals who are using e-liquids for cessation. Exposure to higher nicotine levels increases addiction risk. E-liquids with nicotine content lower than labeled may cause withdrawal symptoms. These are not concerns when using FDA-approved cessation products under the care of an NP. FDA involvement. The FDA requires ENDS manufacturers to file a premarket application; it is illegal to market these products without premarket authorization.25 However, most ENDS products have not been authorized by the FDA. It is of concern that given the overwhelming number of products available, the FDA states that they are unable \"to take enforcement action against every illegally marketed tobacco product.\"25 The FDA does not perform quality testing of e-cigarettes (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). Additionally, if there are no drug claims (such as for tobacco cessation), then there are neither specific quality standards or regulations for the manufacturing processes of e-cigarettes, nor for the end product (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). No e-cigarette or similar product has been approved as a drug product; therefore, no e-cigarettes are affected by the requirements that apply to FDA-regulated drugs (D. Jenson, e-mail communication, May 11, 2021). Concerns related to using e-liquids and ENDS for quitting tobacco use E-cigarette use is a particularly compelling nicotine option for cigarette users because it mimics both the physiologic satisfaction of a nicotine craving as well as the psychologic satisfaction of the act of smoking and responding to external cues that lead to smoking (time of day, social situations, behavioral triggers). The sensory and physical stimuli associated with cigarette smoking are deeply embedded aspects of smoking enjoyment and dependence (hand-to-mouth action, deep inhale/exhale, visual cues, throat hit, and tobacco flavor). The close imitation to cigarette smoking is one reason that cigarette users struggle with e-cigarette cessation, even when their original intention is to use e-cigarettes to stop all tobacco use.26 ENDS have been found to carry several health risks (see ENDS use-associated risks). Perhaps most concerning is the finding of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) that emerged in 2019.27 EVALI is an acute pulmonary illness that has been associated with ENDS use, which can be severe and life-threatening, and is characterized by bilateral infiltrates on radiologic imaging.27 It has been shown that the e-liquid additive vitamin E acetate is strongly linked to EVALI.28 Additional ENDS-related health risks include the lack of safety data associated with inhaling many of the e-liquid additives, defective device batteries causing fires and explosions, and acute nicotine poisoning related to ingestion, inhalation, and topical absorption of e-liquids.29 Clinical guidelines relating to ENDS Nicotine users often ask whether ENDS are safe and effective and whether they can be used for cessation from traditional tobacco products. Many worldwide studies have attempted to answer that question. However, NPs and other clinicians face difficulties when interpreting such studies. First, ENDS products are not actively regulated; specific product analysis included in one study cannot be generalized to other products because of differences in the ENDS product devices as well as the liquid ingredients. Secondly, as mentioned, research shows that the actual nicotine content in ENDS products can vary, sometimes significantly, from their label.17,22 Finally, the puff patterns of ENDS users (how much of and how fast each puff is inhaled) are often not standardized in clinical trials, leading to wide variability of ENDS use, making comparisons difficult. Some clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have tried to summarize all the studies to determine whether NPs can recommend ENDS products for tobacco cessation, which are described below. In 2018, the American College of Cardiology's Decision Pathway on tobacco cessation treatment recommended that \"given the uncertainties of the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on health, a clinician should advise cigarette smokers seeking to quit to use evidence-based, FDA-approved, safe, and effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies as first-line treatments in preference to e-cigarettes.\"30 However, the document notes that some patients will choose to use ENDS products even if FDA-approved treatments are recommended. In those cases, the clinician should support the patient's effort to modify tobacco use and recommend use of ENDS products in the safest way possible (for example, avoid dual use of ENDS and cigarettes, ensure child-proof packaging and avoid using around children, and follow device instructions to minimize risk of explosion), with the goal of quitting both tobacco and ENDS products. In 2020, the American Thoracic Society's CPG for medication treatment in adults who use tobacco recommended that varenicline is a preferred treatment option over ENDS products.31 Studies evaluated in this CPG comparing varenicline with ENDS products showed that the benefit of varenicline over ENDS was uncertain; however, varenicline had fewer adverse reactions than ENDS products. Additional studies comparing varenicline with ENDS are needed to increase confidence in the recommendation. In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) stated that \"evidence on the use of e-cigarettes for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons, is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.\"32 The USPSTF recommends that clinicians direct nonpregnant patients to FDA-approved pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation.32 Clinicians are advised to direct pregnant persons to behavioral interventions. NPs should be aware of the many risks associated with ENDS products as well as the lack of evidence supporting the use of ENDS as a cessation method. Avoidance of ENDS products should be recommended; however, when that is not possible, approaching ENDS products in the same manner as other tobacco products would support patients' attempts to achieve both tobacco cessation and ENDS abstinence. Conclusion The science is still developing on the short- and long-term effects of ENDS on health and tobacco cessation efforts. Quality control of ENDS products is lacking. The actual nicotine content in ENDS products is often unknown, making it difficult to calculate the risk of replacing cigarettes with ENDS while ensuring equivalent levels of nicotine. Conversely, FDA-approved treatment medications are safe, effective, and have well-established dosing aimed at minimizing nicotine withdrawal and maximizing cessation success. Currently, there are no healthcare provider guidelines that recommend ENDS as a safe or effective means for cessation. The authors concur with current science-based guidelines that ENDS use for tobacco cessation is not recommended. NPs can instead recommend the cessation products approved by the FDA.",

The standard of care and evidenced-based treatment consist of behavioral in conjunction with pharmacological therapy. In the United States, there are seven pharmacological agents approved for use as single agents, while for heavily addicted or recalcitrant smokers a combination of more than one agent may be needed.

      "title": "Does cigarette smoking cause stress?",
      "abstract": "Smokers often report that cigarettes help relieve feelings of stress. However, the stress levels of adult smokers are slightly higher than those of nonsmokers, adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking, and smoking cessation leads to reduced stress. Far from acting as an aid for mood control, nicotine dependency seems to exacerbate stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Thus, the apparent relaxant effect of smoking only reflects the reversal of the tension and irritability that develop during nicotine depletion. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal. The message that tobacco use does not alleviate stress but actually increases it needs to be far more widely known. It could help those adult smokers who wish to quit and might prevent some schoolchildren from starting.",

Marked affective shifts, emergence of hidden themes, and role reversals followed the course of the drinking experience. However, with the cessation of drinking, a return to the typical sober state ensued. It would appear that the use of alcohol itself might also be applied to further research in the area of treatment for the chronic alcoholic.",

Also, a wealth of information allows for an interesting distinction between physical and cognitive performance. Most adults in America consume moderate doses of caffeine in various forms on a daily basis as caffeine is typically found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, dietary supplements, energy drinks, energy shots, and chocolate, as well as over-the-counter pills and gums. Although caffeine is readily available and widely consumed, when using it to enhance performance, a few factors should be considered. The authors discuss caffeine use among Servicemembers, its properties and effects on physical and cognitive performance, how to use it to optimize performance, and, finally, some of safety and regulatory considerations. The bottom line is that all individuals do not respond the same way to caffeine and their response depends on how the body uses and breaks down caffeine. Thus, as a user, you should monitor your own responses and performance changes when using caffeine based on the general recommendations provided.",

      "abstract": "Abstract I examine whether working hours have a causal effect on the health behaviors of workers. In assessing the causal relationship, I estimate fixed‐effects instrumental variable models by using exogenous variation in adopting a reduced workweek in South Korea as an instrument for work hours. The estimation results reveal that shortening work hours induces individuals to exercise regularly and decreases the likelihood of smoking, with more pronounced effects for heavy smokers. While a work‐hour reduction substantially increases the probability of drinking participation, it does not significantly affect the likelihood of frequent or daily drinking habits. In addition, the effect of a work‐hour reduction on regular exercise is salient among women and older groups, and the effect on smoking behaviors is more pronounced among men and middle‐aged groups.

      "abstract": "Alcohol has a certain effect that encourages children to become criminals. Alcoholic beverages greatly affect brain function, but if they are absorbed into the blood or gradually inhibit the activity of the nervous system, alcoholic beverages greatly affect human thinking ability, which can cause children to be guilty. The effect of alcohol on crime is that alcohol abuse has a negative impact on minors. Alcoholic drinks are widely circulated and consumed by minors because there are many illegal liquor sellers who do not have official permission to sell alcoholic beverages because they are consuming alcoholic beverages. Article 300 paragraph 1 reads: (1) a maximum imprisonment of one year or a maximum fine of four thousand five hundred rupiahs; first. Any person who deliberately sells or gives intoxicating drinks to a person who appears to be drunk; Trafficking in women and trafficking of minors is punishable by imprisonment of up to six years. (2). Anyone who knowingly intoxicates a child under the age of sixteen; 3. Any person who by coercion or threat of violence forces someone to drink an intoxicating drink. Meanwhile, according to Erikson (in Alwisol, 2009), adolescence or youth is one of the stages of human development, especially at the age of 12-20 years. Any person who deliberately sells or allows an intoxicated person to drink, deliberately intoxicates a person under the age of 16 and forces him to drink, shall be punished by a maximum imprisonment of six years.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol is both a nutrient and a drug. Being a significant source of energy, ethanol has a number of effects that have implications for athletic performance. There are reasons to believe that acute alcohol intake may impair the performance of endurance exercise because of effects on metabolic, cardiovascular, and thermoregulatory functions, and that its neurological actions may affect the performance of skilled tasks because of effects on reaction time, fine motor control, levels of arousal, and judgment. Resynthesis of the glycogen stores in liver and muscle is one of the key goals of athletes after intensive training or competition. The concept that modest levels of oxidative stress have beneficial effects on the organism may go beyond simply the issue of training adaptations. The ingestion of alcohol is likely to have a number of behavioral and other effects that may influence the risk of injury and the recovery process after injury.",

      "title": "E-cigarettes: The Long-Term Liberal Perspective",
      "abstract": "The debate for and against making e-cigarettes available to smokers is to a large extent empirical. We do not know the long-term health effects of vaping and we do not know how smokers will respond to e-cigarettes over time. In addition to these empirical uncertainties, however, there are difficult moral issues to consider. One such issue is that many smokers in some sense choose to smoke. Though smoking is addictive and though many start young, it does not seem impossible to plan for and implement cessation. Yet many choose not to do so and we arguably have some reason to respect this choice. I propose that liberal opposition to strict tobacco control, based on respect for choice, is mitigated when e-cigarettes are available, since they are such a close substitute. Making e-cigarettes available to smokers might therefore not only enable switching in practice, but may make tougher tobacco control more justified. Another moral issue is that making e-cigarettes widely available might induce many people to vape, who would otherwise have neither vaped nor smoked. If this is so, the price of using e-cigarettes to accelerate smoking cessation may be a long-term vaping epidemic. Since vaping is less harmful than smoking, both individuals and society will have less reason to end this epidemic and so it may endure longer than the smoking epidemic would otherwise have done. This raises further questions around the weighing of reduced harm to current smokers against increased harm to future vapers. Implications: Because they are a close substitute, e-cigarettes makes tougher tobacco control more morally and politically feasible. Because e-cigarettes are less harmful than combustibles, making them available may accelerate smoking cessation but also lead to a long-term vaping epidemic, as we have less reason to combat vaping, once established. Moral evaluation of this possible scenario requires considering at least three things: (1) the cost of addiction to autonomy, in addition to health effects, (2) possible distributional effects due to differences between current smokers and future vapers, and (3) the fact that a possible vaping epidemic affects mainly future people and future society.",

      "abstract": "Until the last quarter of a century, alcoholism was almost universally regarded as a mere moral perversion, a bad habit entered into and continued because of moral degeneracy. Numerous efforts were made to reclaim and reform the drunkard. Almost all of these consisted in an appeal to the moral and emotional nature of drinking men and many were thus influenced to abandon the use of alcohol, but a large majority were unreached by these efforts. In more recent years, the wretched condition of these men has appealed strongly to scientific men who were students of human nature as well as of abstract science, and the causes or influences which lead such men to enter on and continue the use of alcoholic beverages has been studied from every view-point. These studies have fully established the fact that only in a very small percentage of cases is alcoholism a mere moral perversion,",

      "abstract": "I we define alcoholism as: “A chronically relapsing disease” we are, in effect, admitting that our treatment programs are inadequate. No one expects 100% of persons treated for alcoholism to emerge transformed from a usually troubled habitual drinker of toxic amounts of ethanol into a happy, flourishing person who does not drink. However, if we attended to what has scientifically been discovered, treatments can be transformed, hence allowing for transformation of our clients. We can continue to hope for some magical, spiritual transformation to finally bring enlightenment to those beset by the disease of alcoholism. Or, we can hope for eventually discovering a medicine fixing the inherent problem of the alcoholic. Or, for the better, we can incorporate recently derived knowledge and step by step design treatments that will make relapse to drinking toxic amounts of ethanol uncommon rather than a definition of a problem needing resolution. I will show that prescribing naltrexone is merely a setting condition for correcting the toxic effects of ethanol on brain that, in turn, has reduced the cognitive ability to make the needed changes in life-styles to support continuing abstinence. Although we used to think that a brain once damaged was not repairable, I will show that he can provide computer-assisted game-like programs that will undue the cognitive decline caused by chronic intoxication thereby enhancing the ability to resist temptations, be less impulsive and develop new life-styles. New knowledge directs us to focus on cognitive rehabilitation for improving treatment outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Physicians who truly understand obesity will find Daniel Cappon's pithy monograph conservative, well written, and accurate, but narrow in scope. The author's chief point is that overweight is caused by a combination of overeating and insufficient exercise. Although the thesis is hardly original, it can be scathingly effective when applied. Dr. Cappon's psychoanalytic background and extensive experience in treating both obesity and cachexia make for an interesting and well-crafted approach to a familiar problem. One current research trend is to lump total drug and food abuse into the category of<i>substance abuse</i>. This concept can give the physician options of perceiving important similarities between obesity, alcoholism, and heroin addiction. All forms of substance abuse have in common two features: (1) an imbalance in the metabolism or utilization of the substance, and (2) lack of proper exercise and mind-body balance that choice forms of corrective exercise may help to induce. <i>Eating,</i>",

Die Studienteilnehmer sind je nach Grad der Nikotinabhangigkeit einer der zwei Gruppen, Raucher mit „keiner/masigen Nikotinabhangigkeit“ oder mit einer „deutlichen/starken Nikotinabhangigkeit“, zugeteilt worden. \r\nDabei stellte sich heraus, dass durchaus einige signifikante Unterschiede zwischen den stark und weniger stark nikotinabhangigen Rauchern existieren. \r\nEin ungesunder Lebensstil setzt sich aus Stress, Bewegungsmangel, fettreicher Ernahrung und dergleichen zusammen, wahrend hingegen ein gesundheitsforderliches Verhalten eine ausgewogene Ernahrung, korperliche Aktivitat, etc. beinhaltet. \r\nDie Nikotinabhangigkeit scheint dabei durchaus eine entscheidende Rolle zu spielen. So sind Auffalligkeiten, wie der Konsum einer risikotrachtigen Kost, eine geringere Bewegungsaktivitat, ein hoherer Alkoholkonsum und ein verminderter Verzehr von gesunden Nahrungs- und Genussmitteln bei den stark nikotinabhangigen Raucher festzustellen, was allesamt einem ungesunderen Lebensstil zuzuschreiben ist. Weniger stark nikotinabhangige Raucher scheinen einen gesunderen Lebensstil und ein damit verbundenes gesunderes Gesundheitsverhalten zu bevorzugen. \r\nStresssituationen sind in beiden Gruppen, den stark und weniger stark nikotinabhangigen Rauchern, Teil des Lebens. Die Verarbeitung von Stress verlauft jedoch nicht in allen Aspekten gleich. Es wird im Zuge dessen zwischen negative und positive Stressverarbeitungsstrategien unterschieden. Stark nikotinabhangige Raucher wenden stressvermehrende Verarbeitungsmoglichkeiten, anders Negativstrategien, haufiger an als die andere Gruppe der Probanden. Im Rahmen der Untersuchung der Positivstrategien sind keine derartigen Auswirkungen einer unterschiedlich haufigen Anwendung festzustellen.",

      "abstract": "The past decade has seen the emergence of new and different patterns of drug abuse in the United States. Previous to the “psychedelic revolution,” abuse of drugs (other than alcohol) was largely limited to urban minorities and a Bohemian fringe. Beginning in the early 1960s, however, the use and abuse of new and nonconventional psychoactive substances became increasingly common among young people of many socioeconomic strata—most notably among the middle class. During its formative stages, the use of such drugs (primarily marijuana and LSD) was associated with what has commonly been termed a youth movement oriented toward the creation of a new consciousness. Psychedelic drugs were viewed in the esoteric sense as sacraments, and in the most mundane sense as pleasant and harmless means of enhancing one's sense of well-being. In any event, the prevalent rationalizations underlying the use of such substances were couched in philosophical terms. Psychotogens (especially LSD) were seen by many as liberating agents, aids in engendering new and better qualities of being in those who used them.",

Men continue to consume more alcohol than women, and as a result suffer more adverse effects. This gender difference is smaller for rates of drinking versus abstaining from alcohol, and greater for the heaviest and most problematic drinking patterns. At any given level of consumption, however, women who drink are at greater risk of problems, particularly from health effects. Furthermore, gender differences in consumption and problems are growing smaller in a number of countries. Nevertheless, the multiple possible causes for such gender differences mean that the gender gap is likely to persist to some degree for a long while yet.",

      "abstract": "GHB is an anaesthetic that in Netherlands since the 1990s is used as a drug by various groups. Although GHB is often defined as a ‘party drug’, particularly in rural areas it is also used in street cultures. GHB is mainly used recreationally, but a minority uses the drug frequently and/or becomes addicted. GHB use and associated problems are disproportionately spread across the Netherlands and are concentrated in certain rural areas (‘trouble spots’), especially in low SES villages or neighbourhoods. Predominantly based on qualitative research, this article describes supply and use of GHB in rural ‘trouble spots’. The profile of experienced current GHB users in rural areas is characterized by a wide age range, a low level of education, often multiple psychosocial problems and poly drug use. They are almost exclusively ‘white’, in majority male users, of whom a large part has been arrested on several occasions. From a supply perspective, GHB could spread quickly because of the short distribution chain, the limited social distance between dealers and users, as well as the closeness an reticence of user groups. Even though as a drug GHB is very different from methamphetamine, there are striking similarities in set and setting characteristics between rural GHB use in the Netherlands and rural methamphetamine use in the US.",

      "abstract": "This review aims to examine the effects of tea, coffee, and green tea consumption on human cognitive performance and mental health. Tea, coffee, and green tea are widely consumed beverages worldwide and contain various bioactive compounds that may influence cognitive function and mental health. Research has suggested that caffeine, the primary psychoactive compound in coffee and tea, can improve cognitive function, including attention, alertness, and working memory. The effect of caffeine on cognitive performance may be moderated by individual differences in caffeine metabolism and genetic factors. Green tea contains high levels of catechins, which have been linked to improved cognitive function, such as attention and working memory, as well as reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, has also been associated with relaxation and reduced anxiety. In addition to cognitive performance, tea, coffee, and green tea consumption have been linked to improved mental health outcomes. Research has suggested that coffee consumption may be associated with a lower risk of depression, while green tea consumption has been linked to reduced symptoms of anxiety and stress. However, the evidence regarding the effects of tea, coffee, and green tea on cognitive function and mental health is mixed, and further research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of these beverages. Additionally, individual differences in caffeine metabolism, genetic factors, and other lifestyle factors may influence the effects of tea, coffee, and green tea on cognitive function and mental health.",

In the literature, it is reported that butane inhalation directly affects central nervous system, respiratory and cardiovasculer systems. To prevent this increasing trend, we believe that society, especially youth, should be educated through precautionary educational activities, sales of lighter refill tubes should be monitored and be made age-restricted, and lighter refill tubes should have warning signs that everyone would understand and attract attention. We present a case of the sudden death of a seventeen-year-old male due to inhaling butane containing lighter refill gas with friends along with the autopsy findings and the results of toxicology and histopathology investigations.",

      "title": "Depression and smoking cessation: does the evidence support psychiatric practice?",
      "abstract": "Depression and smoking are highly comorbid. The vast majority of psychiatrists treating depressed patients do not target or treat nicotine dependence, and many inpatient psychiatric facilities implicitly condone smoking by providing 'smoke breaks'. The reasons for failure to treat are unclear, but are probably linked to the notion that depressed smokers are neither willing nor able to quit, and will become more depressed if they try. We review the clinical evidence on depression and smoking cessation, and find little support for current psychiatric practice. Although quitting smoking does appear to pose a risk for the development of depression, this risk is not clearly higher in those with a past history of depression than those without. Depressed smokers are as capable as nondepressed smokers of quitting smoking, and at least one-quarter of depressed smokers is willing to try. Sustained abstinence may even lead to improvement in depressive disorders. More research is needed to understand the relationship between depression and quitting smoking, but current clinical evidence suggests more resiliency among depressed smokers than common clinical wisdom would dictate.",

      "abstract": "The area of human endeavor that has seen the most explosive growth in performance-enhancing drug use is almost certainly sport. At the highest levels of competitive sports, where athletes strain to improve performances already at the limits of human ability, the temptation to use a drug that might provide an edge can be powerful. Many athletes persist in using performance-enhancing drugs despite official disapproval, possible disqualification, and even risk to their own health. They do so in the face of expert opinion, which casts doubt on the effectiveness of the drugs they take. Reasons commonly given to limit liberty fall into three classes: those that claim that the practice interferes with capacities for rational choice; those that emphasize harms to self; and those that emphasize harms to others. The case of performance-enhancing drugs and sport illustrates a fourth reason that may justify some interference with liberty, a phenomenon we can call \"inherent coerciveness.\"",

      "abstract": "Recent research has suggested that practicing small acts of self-control can lead to an improvement in self-control performance. Because smoking cessation requires self-control, it was hypothesized that a treatment that builds self-control should help in quitting smoking. A total of 122 smokers either practiced small acts of self-control for 2 weeks before quitting smoking or practiced a task that increased their awareness of self-control or feelings of confidence, without exercising self-control. Their smoking status was assessed using daily telephone calls and biochemically verified. Individuals who practiced self-control remained abstinent longer than those who practiced tasks that did not require self-control. Supplemental analyses suggested that the increased survival times were a product of building self-control strength and were not produced by changes in feelings that practicing should help in cessation, effort exerted on the practice task, or thinking more about self-control while practicing.",

The person who is in generally good health and has no looming danger, may not be particularly motivated to do anything differently. If, on the other hand, there is possible danger in the future—for a smoker or for someone living through a pandemic—there are actions that should be taken now. In this case, optimism may not be beneficial. Overwhelming numbers of smokers who start young thinking they can quit come to regret their decision to start smoking. In this case, defensive pessimism, while relatively unpleasant in the moment, may lead to more effective action and better outcomes in the future. Once the status quo has been lost and the goal is recovery from illness or injury and in the hope of regaining one’s prior healthy status, optimism, even unrealistic optimism, maintains motivation and leads to positive outcomes.",

They don’t realize that all of the normal rules of human conduct are thrown out of the window when a person is addicted. Nor do they realize that the obsession and compulsion to use are intricately affected by the brain in ways that even scientists still don’t fully understand. In Alcoholics Anonymous, a book written by alcoholics for others suffering from alcoholism, there is a passage that illustrates the insanity of addiction and how the alcoholic is controlled by obsessions and compulsions to drink.1",

Valorar la relacion existente entre la ganancia ponderal al dejar de fumar y la recidiva. 4. Determinar la influencia del ejercicio fisico sobre el abandono del tabaquismo. 5. Averiguar que variables ayudan a predecir el exito al ano en el abandono del tabaco. Las conclusiones a la vista de los resultados son las siguientes: 1.- las cifras obtenidas en el seguimiento anual, sobre el abandono del tabaquismo, son algo inferiores a las publicadas por los autores mas representativos. 2.- el grado mayor de dependencia, incide negativamente en el exito del abandono del tabaquismo al ano, mientras que los intentos previos de cesacion constituyen un factor predictor del exito. El uso inapropiado del chicle por parte de nuestros pacientes no permite descartar la eficacia de esta modalidad terapeutica. 3.- el incremento ponderal no ha influido de forma significativa en la recaida. 4.- la realizacion concomitante de ejercicio fisico, durante la terapia, el cumplimiento de la asistencia y el cambio en los habitos de vida, son variables que predisponen al abandono del tabaquismo. 5.- la gratuidad del metodo, y la carencia de infraestructura administrativa creemos inciden negativamente en los resultados. 6.- el hecho de que en nuestra sociedad se tome como habitual lo excepcional en otras, asistencia a bares y restaurantes, consumo diario de alcohol incide en que cualquier actitud que requiera disciplina sea con frecuencia obstaculizada desde colectivos que adoptan la relajacion como estilo de vida.",

      "title": "Role of physical activity in regulating appetite and body fat",
      "abstract": "Abstract Recent articles in the press have questioned the role of physical activity in regulating appetite and controlling bodyweight. These articles can be confusing and misleading for the public. Yet this is a complex area and there is disagreement about the importance of physical activity even among academics. Uncertainty and misunderstanding in this area may be related to the heterogeneity of the term ‘physical activity’, which encompasses sporting pursuits with extremely high levels of energy expenditure over prolonged periods of time, as well as everyday tasks involving much lower levels of energy expenditure on an intermittent basis. This latter form of physical activity includes what has been termed ‘non‐exercise activity thermogenesis’. In the right circumstances, physical activity can make a major contribution to the maintenance of a healthy weight even in the absence of dietary control although a combination of the two is almost certain to be more effective. In the long‐term, evidence suggests that for most people exercise is likely to lead to only modest weight loss. This may be due to an insufficient amount of physical activity being performed together with compensatory changes in eating and exercise behaviours. This is hard to prove because energy intake and energy expenditure are difficult to quantify in free‐living situations. Individual differences in the way people respond to exercise due to both environmental ( e.g . social class, education level, income, eating and exercise behaviours of family and peers, weather) and genetic factors also contribute to uncertainty about the effectiveness of physical activity for weight control. Nevertheless, physical activity remains a vital component of a healthy lifestyle due to its positive influence on energy balance as well as its potential to reduce the risk of lifestyle‐related diseases.",

This review discusses the available scientific evidence on the effects of mixing energy drinks with alcohol.A literature search was performed using the keywords \"energy drink and Red Bull(®)\" and consulting Medline/Pubmed, PsycINFO, and Embase.There is little evidence that energy drinks antagonize the behavioral effects of alcohol, and there is no consistent evidence that energy drinks alter the perceived level of intoxication of people who mix energy drinks with alcohol. No clinically relevant cardiovascular or other adverse effects have been reported for healthy subjects combining energy drinks with alcohol, although there are no long-term investigations currently available. Finally, whilst several surveys have shown associations, there is no direct evidence that coadministration of energy drinks increases alcohol consumption, or initiates drug and alcohol dependence or abuse.Although some reports suggest that energy drinks lead to reduced awareness of intoxication and increased alcohol consumption, a review of the available literature shows that these views are not supported by direct or reliable scientific evidence. A personality with higher levels of risk-taking behavior may be the primary reason for increased alcohol and drug abuse per se.

However, the medicinal use of this herb dates back to the early days of the emergence of our own species: some anthropologists theorize that some of the genus Homo has progressed in the struggle for survival with other hominids precisely because of the advanced knowledge – kept to the proper proportions – it possessed of plants like Cannabis. Millennia later, science – even focusing intensely on the chemical characterization of its more than 530 bioactive components – was still not able to generate verifiable hypotheses in order to explain two of the most remarkable characteristics of the recreational use of this plant: because small chemical changes potentiated the effect of the drug up to 100 times and, mainly, because it would be virtually impossible for an individual to suffer a lethal overdose of the substance. To overcome this paradigm, some compounds derived from delta-ninetetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) - the main component of cannabis – were radioactively marked in an experimental study and, after their induction, it was discovered that they had tropism by brain membranes and that their binding was saturated and stereosleptic. Such evidence strongly suggested the existence of endogenous receptors for the drug and it was these findings that led to the discovery of the Endocanabinoid System (SEC): a physiological apparatus made up of endogenous receptors and binders, philogenetically conserved, responsible for several controls related to neuronal homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "The need for novel and more effective approaches to tobacco control is unquestionable. The electronic cigarette is a battery-powered electronic nicotine delivery system that looks very similar to a conventional cigarette and is capable of emulating smoking, but without the combustion products accountable for smoking's damaging effects. Smokers who decide to switch to electronic cigarettes instead of continuing to smoke would achieve large health gains. The electronic cigarette is an emerging phenomenon that is becoming increasingly popular with smokers worldwide. Users report buying them to help quit smoking, to reduce cigarette consumption, to relieve tobacco withdrawal symptoms due to workplace smoking restrictions and to continue to have a 'smoking' experience but with reduced health risks. The focus of the present article is the health effects of using electronic cigarettes, with consideration given to the acceptability, safety and effectiveness of this product to serve as a long-term substitute for smoking or as a tool for smoking cessation.",

It is most often consumed through smoking, placing the respiratory system in direct contact with the toxic constituents of the drug, which are similar to those of tobacco cigarettes. However, accurate study of the adverse effects of marijuana is difficult to perform, owing to marijuana’s illegal status, variation in smoking technique, often short duration of use compared with tobacco and the frequently confounding factor of concomitant consumption of both marijuana and tobacco. Despite this, there is evidence to suggest that marijuana can impair lung function, damage large airway mucosa and possibly contribute to bullous disease, while its carcinogenic potential is controversial.",

Uporaba alkohola i psihoaktivnih droga sve je rasirenija posljednjih nekoliko desetljeca. Alkohol se naziva najstarijom drogom covjecanstva i danas je u vecini zemalja legaliziran, služeci kao sredstvo za opustanje i relaksaciju. Drustveni stav prema alkoholu razlicit je u razlicitim zemljama, od sirokog odobravanja preko ogranicavanja mjesta prodaje i pijenja, do potpune zabrane u muslimanskim zemljama. Potrosnja alkohola po glavi stanovnika povecala se u gotovo svim zemljama svijeta, a posljedicno se povecao i broj osoba koje pate od bolesti koje nastaju kao posljedica zlouporabe. Stetni ucinci za pojedinca i za drustvenu zajednicu, kao posljedice neodgovarajuce, prekomjerne konzumacije alkohola, brojni su i cvrsto dokumentirani i dokazani.

Neka istraživanja pokazuju da oko 10% muskaraca i 4% žena u europskim zemljama ima određene probleme zbog prekomjernog pijenja alkohola (WHO, 1995, Alcohol and health- implications for public health policy). Prema definiciji «osobe koje imaju probleme s alkoholom» su sve one koje imaju socijalne, psiholoske ili pravne probleme zbog akutnog opijanja ili redovite prekomjerne zlouporabe te ovisnosti o alkoholu. Nema znanstveno utemeljenih podataka o posebnoj licnosti koja bi bila posebno sklona razvoju alkoholizma, tako da ne postoji jednostavan nacin predviđanja u koga ce se, a u koga nece pojaviti problem ovisnosti i zlouporabe alkohola. Poseban problem predstavlja alkoholizam među mladima.",

      "abstract": "Weight-loss supplements typically fall into 1 of 4 categories depending on their hypothesized mechanism of action: products that block the absorption of fat or carbohydrate, stimulants that increase thermogenesis, products that change metabolism and improve body composition, and products that suppress appetite or give a sense of fullness. Each category is reviewed, and an overview of the current science related to their effectiveness is presented. While some weight-loss supplements produce modest effects (&lt;2 kg weight loss), many have either no or few randomized clinical trials examining their effectiveness. A number of factors confound research results associated with the efficacy of weight-loss supplements, such as small sample sizes, short intervention periods, little or no follow-up, and whether the supplement is given in combination with an energy-restricted diet or increased exercise expenditure. There is no strong research evidence indicating that a specific supplement will produce significant weight loss (&gt;2 kg), especially in the long term. Some foods or supplements such as green tea, fiber, and calcium supplements or dairy products may complement a healthy lifestyle to produce small weight losses or prevent weight gain over time. Weight-loss supplements containing metabolic stimulants (e.g., caffeine, ephedra, synephrine) are most likely to produce adverse side effects and should be avoided.",

Both marijuana and synthetic cannabinoid usage could lead to addiction. In spite of this, the consumption of them is growing among young people. Synthetic cannabinoid products are more dangerous than marijuana, their effect is usually unpredictable, because during their production, many other psychoactive substances are added to the synthetic cannabinoids, like amphetamine, opiates, benzodiazepins, to enhance their euphoric effect and addictivit y.

      "title": "Smoking Cessation: What to Tell Patients about Over-the-Counter Treatments",
      "abstract": "Mr. T, age 56, has major depressive disorder that is well controlled with fluoxetine, 40 mg/d. He has smoked [greater than or equal to] 1 packs of cigarettes per day for last 25 years. On a recent visit, he indicates that he has begun using a 21-mg nicotine patch as advised by his pharmacist and that things are going OK, although he has had some slip ups. He is on week 7 of his quitting regimen and now is stepping down patch dosage. Upon further questioning he says that he has been cutting 21-mg patches in half to save money. Mr. T also explains that occasionally he has given in to a strong urge to smoke because it was too much to handle. He states that he does not think this is a big deal because he uses electronic cigarettes and has heard that these products don't contain the bad cancer stuff. At end of Mr. T's visit, he asks for something to help him sleep because has been unable to sleep consistently and has been having vivid dreams since starting patch. He also wants to know how to reduce itching from patch. Approximately 46 million Americans smoke and cigarette smoking accounts for 1 of every 5 deaths in United States each year. (1) Since advent of Stop Smoking campaigns, bans on smoking in public buildings, over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement products, and Surgeon General recommendations, discussing smoking cessation with patients has become standard practice. Research suggests that treatment to quit smoking should include a combination of pharmacotherapy and counseling, such as cognitive-behavioral strategies, support groups, and quitting hotlines. (2) Pharmacotherapy consists of OTC nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products and prescription medications. This article briefly highlights how to counsel patients about using OTC NRT products (Table, page 44). (2-5) Visit this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com for a table that highlights prescription smoking cessation agents. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Patches Nicotine replacement patches are best used for maintenance treatment of nicotine cravings. They deliver a fixed amount of nicotine over 24 hours. (3) Patches have a specially formulated transdermal matrix system and should not be cut. Doing so damages drug delivery system and could lead to drug evaporation from cut edges. (4) Mr. T's psychiatrist advises him not to cut patches but instead purchase 14-mg patch because he is at this step of smoking cessation regimen. Skin irritation caused by adhesive is a common adverse event from nicotine patches. Rotating location of each patch to a different hairless body area is best way to prevent or combat skin irritation. If rotating location of patch does not relieve irritation, patients can apply a thin layer of an OTC hydrocortisone 1% cream to affected site 2 to 4 times a day after gently washing area. (5) Instruct patients to avoid using occlusive dressings over topical application. Nicotine replacement patches also have been reported to cause vivid dreams and insomnia. (3) These side effects may be caused by nighttime nicotine absorption which might be avoided by switching to a different NRT product or removing 24-hour patch when going to bed. (4) Combining treatments Many patients experience nicotine cravings while using nicotine replacement patch. Stressful situations and events can trigger a patient's desire for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms that a patch that delivers a continuous amount of nicotine over 24 hours cannot alleviate. Combining different forms of treatment could combat these symptoms. (2), (3), (5) Combination therapy might consist of using sustained-release bupropion or a nicotine patch with rapid-acting NRT products such as a lozenge, gum, nasal spray, or inhaler. In Mr. T's case, clinicians recommend that he use nicotine polacrilex gum in addition to patch to quell his cravings. …",

      "title": "Flavoured hookah and perioperative risk: Evil goes global",
      "abstract": "Sir, Tobacco (cigarette/bidi) smoking is a recognised evil in anaesthesia practice due to its adverse effects on health and increased perioperative risks. Consequently, perioperative concerns of tobacco smoking have been elaborately discussed in literature.[1] Aware of the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, tobacco-free hookah (also known as flavoured hookah, waterpipe and shisha) is increasingly being promoted and used as a safer alternative despite its potential health hazards. However, adverse effects of hookah in anaesthesia practice have not been adequately addressed. This paper aims to discuss the harmful effects of flavoured hookah and its potential impact on perioperative course and outcomes. Flavoured hookah involves waterpipe system and flavoured constituent shisha, heated with charcoal. The popularity of flavoured hookah among adolescents and young adults in India and other Asian countries has increased significantly in recent times[2] and has been termed as 'public health epidemic' in the western world. Various factors such as availability of multiple flavours, less harshness of smoke, no or less nicotine and importantly, wrong perception of less or no risk associated with its use, are promoting its usage. Although nicotine is absent, smoke of flavoured hookah contains various toxicants such as carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), volatile aldehydes and heavy metals.[3] Effects of these products include cardiovascular diseases (CO), lung diseases (volatile aldehydes) and cancer (PAH and heavy metals). Similar to cigarettes, smoke from hookah can cause ciliary damage, increase viscosity of secretions, reduce muco-ciliary clearance and thus increase the risk of perioperative pulmonary complications. Hookah also disrupts respiratory epithelium, increases airway reactivity and can lead to perioperative bronchospasm or laryngospasm. High carboxyhaemoglobin levels increase the perioperative risk of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias. The air quality found in hookah cafes is also hazardous with a significant level of particulate matter (PM2.5)[3] which can exacerbate the risk of chronic bronchitis or asthma. Additional adverse effects include increased risk of communicable diseases due to sharing of single mouthpiece by users and potential for becoming permanent smokers or dual abuse (alcohol and hookah). Considerations during anaesthesia include high perioperative risk of respiratory (tissue hypoxia from decreased blood oxygen content and leftward shift in oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve) and cardiac morbidity (ischemia, negative inotropy and arrhythmias), misinterpretation of peripheral oxygen saturation with conventional pulse oximeters (similar absorbances of carboxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin at 660 nm), high carboxyhaemoglobin and low oxyhaemoglobin on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, need for modification of drug doses secondary to cytP450 enzyme induction by PAH, changing of CO2absorbent intraoperatively and need for FiO2 = 1 or hyperbaric oxygen to reduce carboxyhaemoglobin half-life.[4] In addition, preoperative evaluation should include chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, carboxyhaemoglobin levels[5] and ABG. Although no outcome relationship has been studied between flavoured hookah smoking and anaesthesia, increased perioperative risk is likely based on the described health hazards. In the absence of data, no recommendations currently are available regarding perioperative precautions, preoperative preparation, duration of abstinence prior to surgery and need for postponement of elective surgeries. To conclude, awareness among general public about potential health risks from use of flavoured hookah is needed, especially the youth who constitute 35% of India's population[6] and are most vulnerable to its use. Since many individuals do not consider its use as smoking and are unaware of its harmful effects, they may not inform about this habit during pre-anaesthetic evaluation. Anaesthesiologists should also be aware of this increasing public health problem and its ramifications in the perioperative period. We would encourage anaesthesiologists to actively seek information from patients about its use, discuss associated concerns, educate patients about its harms and take necessary perioperative measures similar to tobacco smoking.

      "title": "The potential of AB-free kava in enabling tobacco cessation via management of abstinence-related stress and insomnia: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background As the primary cause of various preventable illnesses, smoking results in approximately five million premature deaths each year in the US and a multitude of adults living with serious illness. The majority of smokers know the health risks associated with smoking and intend to quit. However, quitting is very difficult partly because of insomnia and stress associated with it. Current tobacco cessation medications are not designed to address these problems, which may have contributed to their limited success in enabling cessation. Novel interventions are thus urgently needed to enhance success rates in tobacco cessation. Based on its historical usage and our preliminary data, kava is such a candidate. Kava, customarily enjoyed by South Pacific Islanders, is known for its relaxing effects, stress-relieving properties, and ability to enhance sleep. In the US, it is marketed and distributed as a dietary supplement due to its recognized calming properties. A pilot trial was performed among active smokers with a one-week ingestion of a kava supplement. The results for the first-time revealed kava’s potential in enabling tobacco cessation with effects on a panel of biological signatures. The primary goal of this trial is to replicate kava’s effects on the biological signatures of tobacco use, stress, and sleep in addition to its compliance and safety among those who smoke. Methods A double-blind randomized placebo controlled two-arm trial will enroll 76 smokers with intention to quit, who will consume AB-free kava at a dietary supplement dose or placebo, 3 times per day for 4 weeks with two follow-ups. Discussion The study will (1) monitor the adherence to and safety of AB-free kava consumption among smokers and evaluate changes in smoking habits, and (2) quantify a panel of non-invasive translatable biomarkers to objectively evaluate AB-free kava’s holistic effects on biological signatures associated with tobacco use, stress, and sleep. We hypothesize that AB-free kava is a novel and promising intervention to facilitate tobacco cessation via its holistic effects associated with managing stress and insomnia during abstinence. If the results from this study support our hypothesis, kava could emerge as an affordable and accessible dietary supplement candidate for tobacco cessation.

      "abstract": "Beverages containing caffeine are consumed by most people in most countries most days. Consumption is mostly in beverages such as coffee, tea and some soft drinks, and smaller amounts from other foods such as chocolate. Children also consume caffeine, though in smaller amounts even relative to their smaller size. Many questions have been asked about possible health effects of caffeine and have been answered by scientific research. Studies on pregnant women consuming caffeine show no effects on the fetus, infants, or on development followed up to school age. There have been many studies on children of school age. For example, it has been shown that a single dose of 3 mg/kg is without appreciable effect on a variety of behavioral and physiological functions, and even 10 mg/kg, had only minimal effects, within the normal range of differences between the children without caffeine. While newborn infants metabolize caffeine slowly, children from less than 1 year to adolescence metabolize caffeine about twice as fast as non-smoking adults. The numerous studies showing safety of caffeine in adults, combined with the direct studies in children showing they are similar and not more susceptible to caffeine than adults, gives assurance that lifelong consumption of caffeine in foods and beverages, starting in childhood, is without deleterious effects on health.",

Todos los fumadores deben ser animados a dejar de fumar, y todos los profesionales sanitarios tienen la responsabilidad de brindar las herramientas necesarias para que los fumadores consigan la cesación tabáquica. Sin embargo, desafortunadamente no todos los fumadores quieren dejar de fumar. Existen estrategias que pueden ser útiles en aquellos sujetos que no desean dejar de fumar de forma brusca, o que simplemente no desean dejar de fumar, pero si les gustaría reducir el consumo de tabaco. El método de “reducción hasta dejarlo” (RDH) es una estrategia que puede ser útil en fumadores no preparados para dejar de fumar. La terapia sustitutiva con nicotina (TSN) ha demostrado ser efectiva y segura tanto en el método de reducción del consumo de tabaco como en la cesación tabáquica completa. Esta estrategia aumenta tanto la autoeficacia como la motivación en este grupo y disminuye la dependencia física a la nicotina, lo que aumentaría la probabilidad de abandono definitivo a largo plazo.",

Each took part in four first cigarette of the day conditions involving a sham smoking control and three cigarettes differing in nicotine delivery. With increasing cigarette strength gains in letter cancellation speed on smoking increased although an inverted-U relationship was suggested; immediate memory accuracy progressively deteriorated once pre-smoking performance was controlled for. Smokers with greater desire to smoke in situations inducive of low arousal appeared to react more strongly to cigarettes and showed superior gain in cancellation speed on smoking. High cigarette consumption did not lead to between-day tolerance to cigarette effects.",

There is evidence to suggest that smoking can result in alterations of the male sex hormones and is a key cause of and contributor to erectile dysfunction. Smoking can therefore endanger the man's ability to have a family and enjoy sexual activity. A reduction in sperm quality and a reduced response to fertility treatments has also been linked with those men who smoke. The damaging effects of smoking are apparent throughout the lifespan of a smoker. The benefits associated with cessation of smoking are wide and varied with respect to the reproductive health of men; these benefits can include a reduction in the risk of male impotence and an improvement in sexual potency.",

O jeho škodlivosti na ľudské zdravie, včítane jeho asociovaného negatívneho vplyvu na rodinné väzby príslušníkov alkoholikov, sa veľmi dobre vie. Ide o interdisciplinárny problém, ktorého riešenie si vyžaduje finančné vklady, celospoločenskú podporu, angažovanie širšej skupiny odborníkov a nakoniec aj aktívny prístup mládeže i dospelých k tomuto problému. Tu referujeme šesť letálnych prípadov intoxikácií etylalkoholom. Prvá kazuistika sa venuje žene, ktorá v opitosti umiera v herni. Druhý prípad uvádza muža, ktorý v opitosti umiera pri rybníku. Tretí opisuje priebeh výletu spojeného s pitím a úmrtím muža v aute. Štvrtý prípad je založený na báze celodenného popíjania a následným úmrtím muža. Piaty prípad opisuje priebeh bujarej oslavy, ktorá sa končí úmrtím muža. Posledný šiesty prípad dokumentuje ťažkú otravu muža alkoholom, ktorý v kombinácii s požitím kanabinoidov umiera na lavičke autobusovej stanice. Sú diskutované príčiny a dôvody vedúce k takýmto tragickým udalostiam. Upozorňuje sa na nebezpečenstvá, ktoré vyplývajú z nárazového pitia príležitostných konzumentov a tiež na nebezpečenstvá nárazového pitia osôb, ktoré dlhodobo v nadmerných dávkach užívajú alkoholické nápoje. Zvlášť je diskutovaná prevencia užívania alkoholických nápojov detí a mládeže, včítane prevencie alkoholizmu. Sú navrhnuté edukačné programy, ktoré by mohli odtabuizovať túto problematiku a v rámci toho formovať postoje detí, mládeže i dospelých na pitie alkoholu aj s očakávaním zníženia prípadov úmrtí intoxikáciou etylalkoholom v budúcnosti.",

Es esencialmente una epoca de cambios que trae consigo enormes variaciones fisicas y emocionales, transformando al nino en adulto ya que en la adolescencia se define la personalidad, se construye la independencia y se fortalece la autoafirmacion. Uno de los principales problemas en esta etapa, es el consumo de tabaco lo que constituye un grave problema que cada vez es mayor, ya que muchos adolescentes estan comenzando a fumar desde edades cada vez mas tempranas, por presion social de los amigos, por curiosidad o por el afan de experimentar, lo que pone en riesgo su salud y su calidad de vida Objetivos: Conocer la prevalencia del consumo de tabaco en adolescentes estudiantes; conocer la edad de inicio en el consumo; detectar las posibles causas del inicio del tabaquismo; conocer la prevalencia de adolescentes fumadores pasivos; conocer la permisibilidad en la educacion que reciben los adolescentes por parte de sus progenitores; conocer la valoracion que tiene el adolescente del perjuicio que supone el tabaco; conocer la relacion de prevalencia entre padres fumadores.\n Metodologia: El estudio fue de tipo cuantitativo, descriptivo de tipo no experimental. La poblacion sujeta de estudio fueron 1122 adolescentes de 12 a 15 anos de edad estudiantes de secundaria. La informacion se obtuvo mediante la tecnica de la encuesta misma que fue adecuada para los fines de este estudio. Las encuestas se aplicaron previo consentimiento informado, asegurandose en todo momento la privacidad y anonimato de la informacion.\n Resultados: Los resultados obtenidos reflejan la prevalencia del consumo de tabaco en adolescentes de 12 a 15 anos la cual fue de 24.06%, la edad de inicio del consumo fue mas frecuente en los adolescentes de 12 anos, la causa mas frecuente que indican los adolescentes para el consumo de tabaco es la curiosidad (86.52%) lo que hace que se convierta un factor de riesgo para continuar, el 23.7% de los adolescentes no reciben informacion sobre los danos ocasionados por el tabaco, el acceso al tabaco es facil, tanto por adquisicion o por los amigos, tienen creencias erroneas lo que pueden conducir a un mayor indice de fumadores, asi mismo se encontro significancia entre el habito de fumar y el consumo de alcohol, entre los adolescentes.",

      "abstract": "Caffeine consumption has become increasingly popular among children, adolescents, and young adults around the world 15. Many consumers indicate that they ingest caffeinated beverages to increase their energy and compensate for insufficient sleep. The most common forms of supplementation include coffee, soda and energy drinks such as “Monster Energy” and “Red Bull”. Increased caffeinated beverage consumption, especially among youth, is controversial due to concerns surrounding the safety and effectiveness of caffeine supplementation. Caffeinated products are often marketed as enhancing physical performance; This review investigates the efficacy of caffeine supplementation on muscular performance, specifically in terms of muscle strength and endurance. The results demonstrate a variable response to caffeine, with multiple studies demonstrating an increase in muscular strength or endurance, while others showed no effect. Overall, studies lacked consistent evidence to support the hypothesis that caffeine supplementation has beneficial effects on muscular performance, regardless of the dose administered.La consomption du caféine est devenue très populaire parmi les enfants, les adolescents, et les adultes autour du monde. Plusieurs consommateurs indiquent qu'ils boivent les boissons raffinés comme source d'énergie ou pour remplacer le manque de sommeil. Les formes de caféine plus communes incluent le café, le soda, et les boissons d'énergie comme “Monster Energy” et “Red Bull”. L'augmentation des boissons cafféinés, particulièrement parmi les jeunes, est en controverse au sujet de l'efficace et sécurité de sa consomption. On voit souvent les avertissements des produits cafféinés comme les compléments actifs. Dans cette revue, j'ai examiné l'efficace de caféine comme complément actif pour la performance musculaire, particulièrement au sujet de la puissance et endurance. Les résultats démontrent une réponse variée au caféine ou quelques sujets ont obtenu une amélioration en leur puissance et endurance musculaire, mais autres sujets n'ont pas démontré des changements. En général, les recherches manquent l'évidence cohérent pour appuyer l'hypothèse que la consomption du caféine produit les effets avantageux au sujet de la performance musculaire, peu importe le dosage utilisé.",

However, severe reactions can develop, and a small proportion of these may be life-threatening. Before discussing specific drug eruptions, we should like to discuss the proof of a causal relationship between a given drug and an eruption. It is difficult to prove the precise etiologic agent for any suspected eruption. The only way to prove definitively that a given drug has caused an eruption is to discontinue the suspected drug, wait until the reaction clears, and then readminister the drug to observe if a relapse occurs. If the condition improves and ultimately clears entirely when the drug is withdrawn, and reappears when the drug subsequently is readministered, the drug may be regarded as the causal agent. However, readministering the suspected drug is very hazardous, and<i>we must emphasize</i>",

      "abstract": "L’addiction aux drogues d’abus est un desordre psychiatrique caracterise par une consommation compulsive de toxiques, au detriment d’activites alternatives plus benefiques a long terme, et malgre les consequences negatives associees. Cette psychopathologie est ainsi de plus en plus conceptualisee comme le resultat d’une prise de decision pathologique, et l’un des plus grands enjeux de la recherche en addiction est de comprendre les bases neurobiologiques et physiopathologiques de ce dysfonctionnement. Devant les contraintes ethiques, techniques et pratiques inherentes aux etudes neurobiologiques chez l’homme, il est important d’utiliser en parallele des modeles animaux d’addiction. Malheureusement, la validite de la plupart de ces modeles est incertaine. En effet, la prise de drogue est bien trop souvent etudiee dans une situation ou la drogue est la seule recompense disponible. Ainsi, dans ces conditions, il est difficile de determiner si l’animal s’auto-administre une drogue par compulsion, ou simplement parce qu’il n’a pas d’autre activite alternative valable. Une serie d’experiences menees dans notre laboratoire depuis plusieurs annees a montre que lorsqu’un choix est donne entre une injection intraveineuse de cocaine ou d’heroine et un acces a une boisson sucree, la vaste majorite des rats preferent l’eau sucree. Une minorite de rats persevere cependant dans le choix de la drogue au detriment de l’acces a la boisson sucree, et constituerait ainsi une population d’individus vulnerables a l’addiction. Au cours de ma these, mon principal objectif a ete d’etudier les determinants du choix entre prise de drogue (cocaine et heroine) et recompense alternative. Mes travaux de recherche ont permis de determiner les mecanismes de choix utilises par le rat, en testant la validite predictive relative de plusieurs modeles de prise de decision. J’ai egalement contribue a la mise en evidence d’une interaction forte entre le contexte de choix, les effets directs de la drogue et les capacites cognitives specifiques au rat. Cette interaction exerce une influence considerable sur le choix de la drogue chez le rat. Cette decouverte pourrait conduire a une reinterpretation des experiences de choix menees chez le rat et souleve aussi des interrogations importantes sur la validite relative des procedures de choix pour modeliser l’addiction aux drogues.",

What began as a novel way to party through the night has become a mainstay of athletic preparation for a large portion of active adolescents and young adults who are seeking some magical performance edge. On the surface, this sounds reasonable until we consider that energy drinks have a number of crucial flaws. The simple fact is that energy drinks fail to provide their implied value for most consumers, and they contain one or multiple ingredients that may place athletes in peril for adverse outcomes, including death. It is time for the sports medicine community to take a stronger stand on the use of energy drinks if we are to be true to our mission to safeguard the health and well-being of our athletic population. Energy drinks and energy “shots” are nonalcoholic beverages typically comprised of solutions of sugar and carbohydrate, moderate to high amounts of caffeine, and a variety of other proprietary chemicals touted to have energy-giving properties. Though their marketing often focuses on these other chemicals, most notably taurine, glucuronolactone, guarana, yerba mate, and even ephedra, at their core, energy drinks are just cleverly crafted vehicles for sizable quantities of caffeine. Because the FDA considers them supplement products and not foods, energy drinks and shots are not held to the same caffeine limits used for standard beverages. This allows manufacturers to produce them with far higher caffeine concentrations than would be acceptable for soda or coffee, and this lack of regulation clearly contributes to the risk for misuse. Standard 8-oz. energy drinks contain 80 mg to 100 mg of caffeine (a large cup of coffee may contain 200+ mg) while “shots” may contain nearly 200 mg of caffeine in only 2 oz. Though product labels do accurately reflect the synthetic alkaloid caffeine content of these drinks, many of the natural additives, most notably guarana and yerba mate, are powerful natural sources of caffeine that are not included in the labeled total. The end result is a product with a far higher caffeine concentration than even the savvy consumer could reasonably determine. So is there justification for the sports world's obsession with caffeine and related stimulant products? Caffeine has long been heralded as a performance-enhancing chemical, but exercise physiology studies to date have shown caffeine to have limited to no value for sport. Moderate caffeine consumption in the range of 3 to 6 mg·kg−1 has been shown to have a positive impact on performance but only in trained athletes during sustained maximal endurance exercise. No value has been consistently proven for short-burst or power activities, resistance exercise, or with consumption of 9 mg·kg−1 or higher. This lack of proven efficacy is ironic in light of the fact that energy drink use is highly associated with the desire to “amp up” a gym workout or power lifting session where caffeine has no proven ergogenic value. They also are widely consumed in the precompetition time frame as a means of increasing energy or intensity for sport but, again, the data do not support value in those settings either. For most, caffeine intake enhances the perception of athletic prowess but fails to deliver the physiologic value to justify its use. All risk, and no gain. And the risks are substantial. Considering the widespread use of stimulant products, it is no surprise that there have been an alarming number of case reports of significant adverse reactions in association with energy drink consumption. Visits to emergency rooms and calls to poison control centers relating to excessive caffeine or stimulant intake are increasing each year. Tragically, energy drink consumption has been associated with cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, spontaneous coronary dissection, coronary vasospasm, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Other serious adverse effects have included seizures, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, acute psychosis, and high risk/aggressive behavior. These adverse events often result from a “perfect storm” of physiologic factors coming together, the foundation of which is generally an undiagnosed underlying medical condition which becomes manifest when sufficient exacerbating factors are present. In these energy drink cases, the effects of caffeine and other stimulants, coupled with the stresses of sport-elevated heart rate and blood pressure, dehydration, heat stress, and other ingested substances, especially psychostimulants — may precipitate a serious or even lethal event. It is important to note that these risks are even greater in adolescents who often have limited tolerance to caffeine due to infrequent consumption. As a result, younger athletes are more subject to complications, particularly when consuming large and rapid doses of caffeine present in energy drinks, especially in combination with exercise. Concerning trends in the use and misuse of energy drinks can be traced to the obvious appeal generated through aggressive advertising and implied claims of sport benefit. Young, impressionable athletes are inherent risk takers and are increasingly seeking whatever advantage they can gain to augment their sport performance. Energy drink consumption then becomes an accepted part of their athletic preparation because of the inaccurate sense that these products provide a physiologic boost that cannot be obtained without them. These beliefs are further fueled by clever and often deceptive marketing to this vulnerable population. Bright, colorful packaging with a variety of powerful images and enticing names lure athletes with their implied benefits of enhanced athletic performance and boundless energy. Sponsorships of prominent sports teams and major sporting events only deepen the association between energy drinks and visions of athletic success. Unfortunately, there are no safeguards in place to desensationalize these products and their purported athletic value. Products with legitimate athletic value should be safe and should stand on their physiologic properties alone; energy drinks simply do not. So, what are we as a group to do? The sports medicine community owes it to our athletes and active patients to stand up against the rampant and uncontrolled use of energy products. We must be on the front lines of efforts to change the trajectory of this societal trend. All sports medicine providers need to be vocal in our educational efforts for prudent use and to ensure that every athlete knows what the risks and benefits, if any, are from stimulant products that they may be consuming. We need to reiterate again and again that caffeine and its related stimulant chemicals have little to no value to the vast majority of athletes, but the risks extend to everyone who consumes them. Pressure must be applied to compel manufacturers to market their products in a fair and unbiased way with a focus on scientific fact rather than unfounded hype and profit motive, and they should be prevented from targeting vulnerable populations who stand to be harmed the most by energy drink use. Manufacturers also should be required to fairly represent what they know about the potentially harmful effects of their products and clearly provide point of sale information to help consumers make choices appropriate to their athletic or activity goals. The FDA should classify all energy drinks as foods, rather than supplements, so that they will be held to the same caffeine concentration standards as soda and related drinks. Finally, much research is needed to fully understand the safety and efficacy of this group of products; we have really only scratched the surface. If athletes are going to use energy drinks and related products, they need guidance in product choice, caffeine amount, prudence of use for a given athletic endeavor, and avoidance of accidental or intentional overuse. We as sports medicine providers are in a unique position to meet these needs. Our consistent message must be that athletic feats are achieved through hard work and optimal lifestyle management. Energy drinks are a hazardous shortcut that only puts athletes in harm's way. All risk, no gain.",

      "title": "Is dietary restriction beneficial for human health, such as for immune function?",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review The impact of dietary restriction on physiologic function in humans is now beginning to be examined. The clinical trials are fueled by decades of animal experiments showing that dietary restriction delays the aging process and decreases the incidence of many age-associated diseases. The critical issue addressed in this article is whether or not dietary restriction long term is feasible or beneficial in humans. Recent findings Short-term dietary restriction in humans does appear to have beneficial effects at lowering metabolism, especially when examining carbohydrates and weight loss. Dietary restriction long term does, however, have detrimental psychological effects in humans, making its feasibility questionable. Even short-term dietary restriction can negatively impact physical activity and potentially some aspects of immunity. The best avenue for humans to benefit from dietary restriction would be for pharmacological or bioactive food ingredient mimetics to be developed which would be more applicable for long-term use. Summary Dietary restriction per se is unlikely to emerge as a feasible long-term strategy to improve human health. Developing dietary restriction mimetics targeting energy metabolism may prove beneficial, not only in aging, but also in diabetes and obesity.",

      "title": "Life in Emergistan",
      "abstract": "alcoholism: alcoholismFigureFew places in society deal with substance abuse more on a daily basis than the emergency department. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of any besides a drug rehabilitation facility. All day, every day, we struggle with patients seeking narcotic prescriptions. We face overdoses from heroin, OxyContin, and other powerful medications. We frequently see patients suffering from the side effects of marijuana. Methamphetamine and cocaine make for interesting shifts because patients are agitated and aggressive or suffering from chest pain and other somatic symptoms related to their drug use, such as TASER wounds. Who knows what drugs are on the horizon? What deadly chemicals lurk in clandestine labs, waiting for the curious and the addicted to take, inject, or inhale them? What about tobacco? We see its legacy in the gasping breaths of the COPD patient, in the struggles of the asthmatic child with smoking parents, in the new diagnosis of assorted bitter flavors of cancer. But let us not forget alcohol, the social lubricant and economic boon that led to around 88,000 deaths in the United States every year from 2006 to 2010. (CDC. Jan. 3, 2018; http://bit.ly/2DxoIzH.) Alcohol use is celebrated in movies, music, television, and literature. It is the holy grail of students away from home for their first year of college, and is often their constant companion throughout their educational experience. It may continue for life. Alcohol with its impairment, its liver disease, its pancreatitis, its ulcers and varices. Alcohol with its anger, abuse, and violence. I often wonder how many of the violent acts we see never would have happened if not for alcohol. A gun was present when it shouldn't have been, but the real hair-trigger was the loss of moral inhibition, thanks to ethanol. Alcohol and Burnout Here I go from preaching to meddling, as we say in church. I wonder how many physicians we know abuse alcohol. We all know that the stressors of our work are enormous. Burnout is high, frustrations are growing, expectations are unrealistic, and at the end of the day, many physicians simply feel defeated. I worry that all too many emergency physicians, physicians of other specialties, and physicians in training simply drink too much. You know what I mean if you have been a physician for any significant period of time. It starts early: Students in college decide that alcohol takes the edge off. In medical school with a huge course load and worries about the future, they see alcohol as a welcome source of relaxation and social connection. Alcohol flows like a multicolored cataract into the cups of the students. Those long shifts in residency can be stressful. At the end of a call, at the end of a rotation, after in-service exams, after a bad outcome, alcohol is all too common. And their spouses? If their doctor husbands or wives are busy and it's a weekend night with friends, why not kill some beers or bottles of wine? Physicians commonly use alcohol to lubricate the gears of their souls when the crush of patients and the weight of rules, regulations, and frustrations become too much. By the time they have navigated through college, medical school, and residency and discovered the struggles of the thing they dreamed of doing, it's easy to numb the surprise and struggle with alcohol. Have you been to a conference? Alcohol is omnipresent in the evenings when connections are made and deals brokered. Ironically, we rail against the power of Big Pharma and then pour liquid cash into the coffers of Big Alcohol night after night. I'm not judging. I have a drink occasionally. But if you told me I could never have another in my entire life, I'd shrug and move on. (If you said I could never have a donut or fried chicken again, I might need therapy.) I'm aware that most physicians drink responsibly. The rate of physician alcohol abuse, however, is probably slightly higher than that of the rest of the population. As I watch young physicians and their older mentors and their spouses, I'm concerned that it's getting worse. Maybe the rewards of practice are fewer and the stressors higher. Maybe we've simply made that bottle of wine, that craft beer, that aged whisky all a little bit too elegant, too common, too necessary. If we're going to fight the dangers of substance abuse, we would do well to pay attention to the abuse right under our noses. No matter how pretty the bottle, no matter how nice the party, if you abuse it, then that calming liquid is still just booze. Be careful, brothers and sisters. Be careful.

      "abstract": "Bulimia, or “ox hunger,” is characterized by episodes of binge eating, during which there is a large intake of food over a short time span, followed by induced vomiting and occasionally periods of fasting. Classically, the problem starts in a teenage female who perceives herself as being too fat. As a result, the person develops feelings of guilt and low self-esteem.‘,’ An attempt at dieting leads to some weight loss and simultaneous hunger. In the susceptible individual, this hunger results in an eating binge. To counter the effect of the weight gain from the eating binge, self-induced vomiting is initiated. Once the individual realizes that the weight gain caused by the binge can be nullified by vomiting, less restraint is exerted on the binges. A natural progression is for the person to resort to binges not only when hungry, but also when tense or anxious.3 Vomiting is usually carried out in secret, and often with the aid of the emetic ipecac. Laxatives and diuretics frequently become adjunctive agents. Although bulimics may binge and vomit as little as twice a week, the frequency varies and it can become as high as 140 episodes each week.3-6 The average intake of food is 3,400 calories in a 1.2-hour period, with some patients ingesting as much as 50,000 calories in a 24hour period.5 Casper3 characterized the three major manifestations of bulimia nervosa as recurrent episodes of binge eating with an awareness on the patient’s part that the pattern is abnormal, the presence of depressed moods, and the absence of any known physical disorder. In addition, at least three of the following are present: high-calorie intake during the binge, inconspicuous eating during the binge, self-induced vomiting at the end of the binge, repeated attempts to lose weight through dieting and",

      "abstract": "To move toward recovery after a first episode of psychosis, young people must focus on both their mental and physical health. Staying away from tobacco products, alcohol, and marijuana and other drugs; having a healthy diet; getting plenty of exercise; sleeping well; and having social support from family and friends are all necessary parts of a healthy lifestyle. Even those who have already begun to use substances can quit, and though difficult, in the end quitting will improve their mind and body. Even if the young person is not ready to quit completely, reducing substance use is always helpful. One way to introduce new healthy behaviors is by setting achievable weekly goals and tracking progress along the way to keep motivated.",

      "abstract": "Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are psychotropic compounds, chemically created in laboratory to mimic cannabinergic brain activity of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol. The consumption of these compounds for recreational purposes can lead to a variety of adverse effects on health including overdose and deaths. Increasingly popular as substances of abuse since the 2000s, SCs were produced initially to bind and study cannabinoid receptors (they also can be called synthetic cannabimimetics) failing in eliminating the psychoactive effects. Currently, SCs are misused by students and young adults as \"natural products\" because of their herbal aspect. Actually, these apparently innocuous recreational substances hide toxic effects to health. Reported side effects are cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, renal, metabolic, ophthalmologic, pulmonary and psychoactive including dependence and withdrawal. A few cases of SCs ingestion have also been associated with liver failure. We herein review the recent literature on the SCs toxicity with particular attention to liver damage aspects.",

Given the diverse functions of food, the challenge is to reconcile the pleasure of food and drink with the promotion of optimal health. When food and drink are reduced to chemical terms, the pleasure is essentially absent. Since the number of chemicals which constitute food and drink is substantial and a minority fraction is essential for physiological health, the equivocal chemicals which impart sensory appeal must be distinguished from the chemicals that should be avoided. In all instances, (essential, equivocal, to be avoided) there is a determination of relative risk which must be made.

Tobacco misuse is the leading preventable cause of premature death in the world. Smoking rates among Canadian Indigenous youth are at least three times higher than for their non-Aboriginal peers, an alarming statistic on many levels. The tolls on health from extensive tobacco use range from disproportionately high individual mortality and morbidity to heavy socioeconomic burdens on Indigenous communities. Paediatric health care providers are uniquely positioned to collaborate with community stakeholders to prevent and treat tobacco misuse in young people and their families, while understanding the cultural value of tobacco for many Indigenous peoples. Targeted interventions can positively impact length and quality of life, improve overall health and decrease the immense social and human costs of tobacco misuse.",

      "title": "TOBACCO: POLICING AND SOCIAL POLICY",
      "abstract": "Tobacco has exercised the interest of the nation since Elizabethan times, and the inhalation of its smoke for pleasure has become very widespread. It was not until the mid‐twentieth century, however, that its effects upon health were suspected. It is now widely accepted that tobacco smoke is implicated in a range of dangerous diseases, although the tobacco industry sometimes argues that the link is not proven. The arguments about the conflicting needs of a large, world‐wide industry and the health and prosperity of individuals and society are complex, and often influenced by conflicting vested interests. Government's involvement in the issues is further complicated by its reliance upon large tobacco revenues. The link between advertising and increased smoking, either by existing or new smokers, is not proved by research, although there are strong indications that it exists. The behaviour of most parties involved, including the tobacco companies, indicates that they share the belief of a link. Voluntary controls upon tobacco advertising have had some effect, in that, for example, advertising in the U.K. is no longer overtly directed at children, but various anti‐smoking lobbies believe voluntary control to be ineffective. The present British government has toyed wth the possibility of statutory control, but faces stiff opposition from back‐benchers and within the cabinet; it is also probably philosophically opposed to such measures. More research is needed into the link between advertising and smoking behaviour.",

Forty-four percent used one drug combination, 25% used 2 to 3 combinations, 17% used 4 to 7 combinations, with 14% using 8 to 14 combinations. Nealry 85% used alcohol plus marijuana, with nearly one-third combining alcohol or marijuana with barbiturates, hallucinogens, or amphetamines. Alcohol appeared to be the first drug used; however, it was not abandoned when marijuana use began-both drugs were simply used concurrently, and new drugs were incorporated into the existing patterns of drug use. Interpretations of polydrug use are limited by difficulties in assessing drug use, as well as inconsistencies in the chemical composition of illicit drugs.",

Se expresa que los conocimientos actuales indican que el desbalance entre las actividades de las proteasas y antiproteasas en el pulmon son la base de trastornos morfofuncionales importantes; ese desbalance es mas probable en personas con fenotipos deficientes intermedios y severos para alfa-1-antitripsina, pero es favorecido por un doble mecanismo en los individuos expuestos al humo del tabaco, tanto activa como pasivamente.",

Waterpipe (also known as shisha or hookah) use has increased dramatically during the past decade, mostly due to its improved taste, lack of regulations and social acceptability as a safer option than cigarettes. However, recent clinical and experimental studies indicate that waterpipe use is as, or even more, harmful than cigarettes. Although they differ in the method of consumption, waterpipe tobacco has similar deleterious constituents found in cigarettes but are generated at greater amounts. These constituents are known to induce oxidative stress and inflammation, the major underlying mechanisms of a wide array of chronic pathological conditions. We review the relationship between waterpipe tobacco use and oxidative stress and the disease potential of waterpipe use.",

A functional model argues that nicotine use is not an irrational behaviour but is adopted because it enables the user to control their bodily state, especially their psychological state.

Yet these athletes and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others regularly use drugs in the course of their training, performance, or both. I am talking not about recreational drug use—athletes use drugs for pleasure and relaxation probably no more or less than their contemporaries with comparable incomes—but about a much less discussed type of drug use: taking drugs to enhance performance.",

      "title": "Green Tea Consumption Is Increasing but There Are Significant Hepatic Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Herbal medicines including teas and plant extracts have been in use for thousands of years. There are reports of the use of herbal preparations in Egypt, China, India, and Samaria. Many patients consider “natural” herbal teas to be completely free of unwanted side effects. Many herbal products, however, have biological activities that can result in severe hepatic cell toxicity or interact with other herbal products or prescription medications. Their use is increased dramatically. The most common herbal teas and nonmineral natural products are used as self-medication, principally for health improvement. However, these products are potentially dangerous to some individuals. Monitoring for liver injury is an important aspect of drug and herbal safety assessment. When present, herbal-induced liver injury (HILI) may limit the use or result in the discontinuation of these agents. HILI can exhibit with a wide spectrum of clinical and laboratory manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferases to acute liver failure. Most cases of HILI resolve within several weeks after herbal remedy discontinuation. However, some cases can persist as low-level aminotransferase elevations. Our review aims to (1) describe the possible significant discrepancies between the ingredients listed on the label and the actual contents of the preparation; (2) evaluate teas containing multiple plants or herbs which may be adulterated by more toxic herbs, heavy metals, microbials, pharmaceuticals, and medicines; (3) describe pathophysiologic events in herbal tea-induced hepatotoxicity; and (4) discuss the key elements required for attributing the consumption of tea to the induction of liver injury. The widespread use of mixed heterogeneous remedies and the lack of randomized trials are an obstacle to providing safe use of plant-derived teas.",

Both caffeine and creatine are common elements of the diets of many North Americans, and it is difficult to establish whether they are nutrients, natural health products, nutraceuticals, and/or drugs. Caffeine is one of a number of methylxanthines that share similar physiological and pharmacological properties. Caffeine is the world's most frequently consumed drug and is found naturally occurring in more than 60 different plant species. Caffeine and creatine are two of the most commonly employed ergogenic aids. Given that the theme of the text is food–drug synergy and safety, we use caffeine, coffee, and insulin actions as the example of food synergies.",

      "title": "Acute Effect of Gutkha Chewing on Cardiopulmonary Efficiency in Short Term Users",
      "abstract": "Tobacco has been used orally alone or in combination with other ingredients. In India tobacco is taken in several forms. Use of smokeless tobacco indeed represents a health concern of growing magnitude among these groups. As a consequence of its addictive qualities, the consumption of smokeless tobacco often becomes a lifelong habit with cumulative and deleterious effects on health. Smokeless tobacco has been advocated as a substitute for cigarette smoking. On the contrary, the use of smokeless tobacco is fraught with health risk and needs to be discouraged. Previous reports have described long term harmful effects of nicotine on various body parameters, little is known about acute effect of smokeless tobacco on cardiopulmonary parameters. Very few studies have been undertaken on the acute effect of use of Gutkha, a common form of smokeless tobacco in India on cardiopulmonary parameters of youngsters. Methods: Treadmill Exercise Testing & Pulmonary Function Tests were done before and after maximal exercise testing to assess cardiopulmonary efficiency in two groups’ viz., healthy sedentary controls and healthy gutkha chewers. Results: On studying the differences in cardiopulmonary efficiency in the two groups the resting heart rate was found to be statistically significantly higher in the study group and the delta heart rate was found to be statistically significantly lower among gutkha chewers. There was no significant difference seen in parameters like VO2 max, maximum oxygen pulse, MVV, VE max as an acute effect of gutkha chewing. Conclusion: In this study it appears that tobacco chewers are physically fit like controls, but after immediate tobacco chewing a lesser delta HR suggests a higher risk for cardiovascular mortality. Stopping tobacco chewing at this juncture can be helpful in reverting back the risk and parameters like resting HR, recovery HR, and delta HR can be used as prognostic assessment tools for any intervention therapy to stop gutkha chewing in asymptomatic individuals.",

      "title": "How to Treat Nicotine Dependence in Smokers with Schizophrenia: Improve Patients' Health, Help Them Kick Addiction with This Practical Approach",
      "abstract": "Mr. V, age 49, has stable but symptomatic schizophrenia and a 33-year cigarette smoking history. He is very concerned because his primary care physician told him he has 2 serious smoking-related health problems: diabetes and hypertension. He tried a smoking cessation program for the general public, but it was a poor fit because of his schizophrenia symptoms. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Despite adhering to his medications (ziprasidone, 20 mg hs; perphenazine, 8 mg hs; lorazepam, 1 mg hs; zonisamide, 200 mg/d, and benztropine mesylate, 2 mg hs), Mr. V has residual auditory hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and impaired concentration and attention. He smokes approximately 1.5 packs per day, particularly when very ill, to alleviate chronic boredom, and to diminish distress from the hallucinations. All of his friends smoke, and they do not support his attempts to quit. Successfully treating nicotine dependence can seem a formidable challenge in patients with schizophrenia: * 72% to 90% smoke cigarettes, compared with 21% of the general population1 (Box, page 66). (2-12) * They tend to smoke heavily, spending about one-third of their incomes on cigarettes. (13) * Their negative symptoms (such as apathy), positive symptoms (such as disorganized thinking), and cognitive impairment can reduce motivation to quit and adhere to a smoking cessation strategy. * Sociologic and physiologic aspects of schizophrenia reinforce their smoking habit (Table 1, page 69). (9,12,14-17) Even so, smokers with schizophrenia can be highly motivated and persistent in attempting to quit. (18) Promising results have been reported in trials when psychopharmacologic treatments are combined with cognitive and behavioral interventions. This article reviews these empiric studies and suggests practical ways for clinicians to create smoking cessation and relapse prevention plans for individuals with schizophrenia. Clinical trials of smoking cessation Inadequate interventions. Conventional regimens--consisting of 8 to 12 weeks with sustained-release bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) added to supportive or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) (19)--are well-tolerated by patients with schizophrenia but only modestly effective. CBT alone (or with placebo) has not been effective for smoking cessation in schizophrenia. In clinical trials, abstinence rates have been: * 4% to 19% after 3 to 6 months with bupropion or NRT and CBT * [less than or equal to]6% with placebo and CBT. (20-23) Multifaceted interventions. High-dose NRT patch treatment (2 patches at a time) has not consistently shown additional benefits compared with single-patch treatment. (24,25) However, combining short-acting NRT (gum, lozenge, inhaler, or nasal spray) with a long-acting NRT preparation (transdermal patch) is well-tolerated and has been shown to improve sustained abstinence rates (26) (Table 2, page 70). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, (27) 51 smokers with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive combination NRT (21-mg NRT patch plus [less than or equal to]18 mg/d NRT polacrilex gum prn) added to bupropion SR, 150 mg bid, or placebo. Smoking cessation--defined as quitting on the assigned date and maintaining continuous abstinence for 4 weeks (measured by expired air carbon monoxide * 52% of those receiving bupropion and dual NRT * 19% who received placebo and the 2 forms of NRT. Preventing relapse. Relapse is common among all smokers but especially in those with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, 70% to 83% of smokers with schizophrenia who attained abstinence relapsed to smoking within 6 to 12 months of stopping nicotine dependence treatment. (21,22,27,28) In one clinical trial, >50% of patients achieved 4 weeks of continuous abstinence on a regimen of bupropion SR, 150 mg bid; nicotine patch (21 mg/d); and as-needed nicotine gum ([less than or equal to]18 mg/d). …",

Accordingly, numerous approaches have been developed and studied that aim to prevent underage drinking. Some approaches are school based, involving curricula targeted at preventing alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana use. Other approaches are extracurricular, offering activities outside of school in the form of social or life skills training or alternative activities. Other strategies strive to involve the adolescents' families in the prevention programs. Policy strategies also have been implemented that have increased the minimum legal drinking age, reduced the commercial and social access of adolescents to alcohol, and reduced the economic availability of alcohol. Approaches involving the entire community also have been employed. Several programs (e.g., the Midwestern Prevention Project and Project Northland) have combined many of these strategies.",

Although there are few comparative analysis between different presentations, those existent show up similar efficacy for all of them. It has been demonstrated that NRT reduce symptoms of abstinence after complete smoking cessation, reduces weight increase and improves results of any other treatment if uses associate with it. NRT its effective by itself o matter the level of conductual treatment applied to the smokers, although when it's associate to it better results are obtained and programs with higher intensive conductual interventions plus NRT show the best abstinence rates. NRT provides help to quit smoking which added to the limited entity of its side effects makes important not to lessen its indication in any circumstance. The chewing gum requires a little training to obtain optimum results. Concerning the patches main advantage are the ease use and the limited occurrence of side effects thats way it becomes of first election to smoking deshabituation in primary care. Concerning the nicotine tablets its tolerance is very good and as well as the other forms of NRT has demonstrated its efficacy and security on treatment of smokers. The spray of nicotine reaches promptly high peaks of nicotine in blood therefore it exists the possibility to create addiction. It has been evaluated the efficacy of treatment of smokers combining patches and other forms of NRT of rapid liberation concluding that this therapeutic modality increases the success, It is also to manage of NRT in patients with cardiovascular disease, given that the risk/benefit results in favour to NRT. The long term of time during which NRT has been used allows to establish that the use of patches or chewing gum of nicotine can be considered during pregnancy when the balance risk/benefits is favourable.",

Tal efecto ha sido demostrado por diversos estudios aplicados por ejemplo a deportes de equipo como el futbol y el rugby o de alta intensidad, que se caracterizan por una actividad intermitente y duracion prolongada. Teniendo en cuenta que la cafeina tiene propiedades ergogenicas en ejercicios de resistencia y que se ha demostrado que puede aumentar la vigilancia durante episodios de ejercicio exhaustivo prolongado, asi como en periodos de privacion de sueno sostenido, su uso se ha generalizado tanto en deportistas de elite como en aficionados.

Doping with anabolic steroids, such as testosterone, is a severe challenge to the vision, moral and ethics in sports and has also become a significant and increasing problem in society. Objective: The primary aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the contribution of genetic components to inter-individual variation in androgen disposition. Conclusion: Genetic variation has a large impact on androgen disposition. This variation is of the utmost importance for the interpretation of doping test results and may modulate the effects of testosterone replacement therapy and testosterone doping.",

      "title": "Role of pregnenolone derivative AEF0117 on the regulation of CB1 signaling that mediates behavioral effects of THC",
      "abstract": "Le cannabis sativa est l'une des drogues les plus consommees dans le monde. Le THC, sa principale composante psychoactive, represente un facteur de risque de pathologies mentales, telles que le trouble de la consommation de cannabis, la dependance et la psychose. Le THC a un effet biphasique, de fortes doses de THC provoquent une hypoactivite et une aversion, tandis que de faibles doses de THC provoquent une hyperactivite et une recompense. Le THC agit sur le recepteur aux cannabinoides de type 1 (CB1), dont la signalisation est biaisee avec differents transducteurs pouvant vehiculer une voie specifique selon differentes conditions. Il a ete prouve que la signalisation biaisee est pertinente dans la decouverte de medicaments et la comprehension de la signalisation CB1 est essentielle pour le developpement de medicaments a base de cannabinoides. Meme si il a ete montre que differentes doses de THC entrainent des effets comportementaux, cellulaires et moleculaires differents, le lien entre ces phenomenes n'a jamais ete etudie.En outre, il a ete decouvert que la pregnenolone (PREG) est un modulateur allosterique endogene biaise du CB1, en etant un inhibiteur de signalisation specifique du recepteur CB1 (CB1-SSi) et capable de bloquer des comportements induits par le THC. Comme la PREG est un precurseur de steroide, son administration a forte dose peut induire la production de steroides, avec d'eventuels effets secondaires.Ainsi, dans un but therapeutique, des composes CB1-SSi analogues a la PREG ont ete synthetises, ayant le meme potentiel therapeutique que la PREG, mais sans etre metabolises en steroides. Le CB1-SSi etudie ici est le compose CB1-SSi leader, l’AEF0117.Le premier objectif de ce travail etait de comprendre les voies de signalisation intracellulaires selon des doses faibles, moyennes et elevees de THC, conduisant a respectivement l'hyperlocomotion, l'asociabilite et l'hypolocomotion chez la souris.Le second objectif etait de comprendre le mecanisme d'action de l’AEF0117 et sa capacite a bloquer les effets comportementaux et moleculaires du THC a faibles, moyennes et fortes doses.La these est divisee en cinq parties. L'introduction sert a prefacer les concepts du systeme endocannabinoide, ainsi que l'abus de cannabis chez l'homme et les effets comportementaux du THC chez la souris, comme l'hyperlocomotion, l'asociabilite et l'hypolocomotion. L'etat de l'art de la signalisation CB1 impliquant le systeme CB1 biaise est decrit avec un accent particulier sur les inhibiteurs specifiques de la signalisation CB1 (CB1-SSi), en particulier la pregnenolone endogene (PREG), et son analogue synthetique, l’AEF0117.L'article Zanese*, Tomaselli* et al, 2020 (publie dans J. Neurosci. Methods) porte sur la validation de la technique analytique a haut debit (AlphaLISA) de choix dans cette etude pour la detection de la phosphorylation des proteines dans les lysats de tissu cerebral.L'article de Tomaselli et al. (a soumettre) est consacre a l'etude de faible dose de THC qui provoque l'hyperlocomotion chez la souris. Les principales donnees ont revele que le THC via CB1 recrute la voie de signalisation β-Arrestin1-PI3K-Akt-GSK3β, dans les zones du cerveau riches en CB1 et pertinentes pour l'activite locomotrice (NAc, Str, CB), qui conduit a l'hyperlocomotion. En outre, PREG et AEF0117 peuvent bloquer l'hyperlocomotion et les modifications de la signalisation CB1 induite par le THC.La troisieme partie represente les etudes sur les effets du THC a des doses moyennes et elevees qui induisent respectivement un comportement asocial et une hypolocomotion. Chaque dose de THC induit des alterations specifiques des voies de signalisation intracellulaires CB1 et le traitement avec l’AEF0117 reverse les deux comportements.La discussion generale aborde ensuite le role des voies CB1 specifiques dans la dependance et la psychose induites par le THC, et propose un mecanisme d'action pour les composes CB1-SSi, dont l’AEF0117.",

It is probably, after water, the world's most popular beverage, due, more than anything, to its palatability, adaptability and comparative cheapness. Although claims have often been made for its nutritional value it is doubtful whether any can withstand critical examination, apart from those attributable to its water, milk and sugar content. The same is true of the many charges laid against tea, over the years, as a cause of ill-health. These charges persist mainly because they have become 'common knowledge' and are repeated from one generation of authors to another. Chief amongst the charges against tea are that it causes high blood pressure, heart disease, insomnia, hyperactivity in children, peptic ulceration and that, unlike coffee, it contains substantial amounts of theophylline.KeywordsAdenosine ReceptorCoffee ConsumptionCaffeine IntakeMethyl XanthineCaffeine ConsumptionThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "title": "Smoking cessation: the psychiatrist's role.",
      "abstract": "Although tobacco use is one of the leading preventable causes of death and the prevalence of smoking in persons with psychiatric disorders is very high, psychiatrists may be missing opportunities to assist patients to stop smoking, perhaps because this health promotion activity is seen to be in the province of the family physician.1 We may be consulted, however, when patients with psychiatric disorders consider smoking cessation or have difficulty in achieving abstinence.\r\n\r\nA patient with bipolar disorder resolved to stop smoking after experiencing several upper respiratory infections. He was a heavy smoker with a high Fagerstrom nicotine dependence score (8).2 His mood was well stabilized by treatment with lithium carbonate, and his only other medication was atorvastatin.\r\n\r\nThe patient decided on a quit date and started to exercise regularly, to avoid smoking while away from the house and to use nicotine gum 4 mg as needed. With this strategy, his consumption went from over 30 cigarettes daily to about 10 daily; he had no problems apart from cravings for cigarettes. A couple of weeks before the quit date and wishing to further reduce his intake of cigarettes, he saw his family physician, who prescribed varenicline according to the usual schedule (0.5 mg/d initially, increasing to 2 mg/d over 1 week). After starting the varenicline, the patient developed several significant symptoms, many attributable to acute nicotine withdrawal: sadness, difficulty thinking and executing actions, poor energy, and somatic sensations including “kinks in (his) body” and burning eyes. He felt as though he had taken a pill with residual effects that included his head not being clear and an “unnatural feeling.” Cigarettes failed to relieve these symptoms, and the usual feeling of satisfaction from smoking was lacking.\r\n\r\nHe was seen in the clinic after 10 days of treatment with varenicline. It was decided that he would discontinue this medication and attempt to quit as originally planned. His mood and ability to function returned to normal about 4 days after stopping the varenicline, by which time all the symptoms mentioned above had resolved. The patient was subsequently able to stop smoking completely (at the time of writing for 3 weeks) with the aid of the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).\r\n\r\nVarenicline is a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is the main site of action of nicotine. Like NRT and bupropion, the use of varenicline increases the rate of complete smoking cessation by a factor of about 2 to 3. These pharmacologic aids are best employed in conjunction with various non pharmacologic approaches, including counselling and strategies such as making the home smoke-free and exercising regularly. Bupropion is relatively contraindicated in patients with bipolar disorder, given that it can cause mood cycling. Varenicline appears to be quite safe for use in patients with psychiatric illnesses, but there have been reports of exacerbation of schizophrenia and induction of hypomania, or even mania, following treatment with this drug.3–5\r\n\r\nSmoking cessation is a risk factor for the development of depression, but the timing of this patient's symptoms suggests a withdrawal syndrome resulting from an acute reduction in stimulation of the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors after the introduction of varenicline. Occupancy of the nicotinic receptors by this high-affinity drug also accounts for the failure of smoking to relieve the symptoms or produce a positive effect.\r\n\r\nNRT, bupropion and varenicline can be used in combination, and other drugs can also be employed as aids to smoking cessation. A review of these treatments and other aspects of this important field can be found in an excellent article published in the November 2007 issue of the CMAJ6 (cited in bibliography for the online version of this column appearing on the JPN website). NRT in its various forms (patch, gum, etc.) should, in my opinion, be considered the initial drug of choice for smoking cessation, with the other drugs being reserved for cases in which NRT is not tolerated or is ineffective, particularly in patients with psychiatric comorbidity.\r\n\r\nAssisting patients to stop smoking can be highly rewarding, and the more informed we are about developments in this important field, the more effective we will be in helping our patients.\r\n\r\nNicholas J.

      "title": "Drug abuse in athletes",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Drug abuse occurs in all sports and at most levels of competition. Athletic life may lead to drug abuse for a number of reasons, including for performance enhancement, to self-treat otherwise untreated mental illness, and to deal with stressors, such as pressure to perform, injuries, physical pain, and retirement from sport. This review examines the history of doping in athletes, the effects of different classes of substances used for doping, side effects of doping, the role of anti-doping organizations, and treatment of affected athletes. Doping goes back to ancient times, prior to the development of organized sports. Performance-enhancing drugs have continued to evolve, with “advances” in doping strategies driven by improved drug testing detection methods and advances in scientific research that can lead to the discovery and use of substances that may later be banned. Many sports organizations have come to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs and have very strict consequences for people caught using them. There is variable evidence for the performance-enhancing effects and side effects of the various substances that are used for doping. Drug abuse in athletes should be addressed with preventive measures, education, motivational interviewing, and, when indicated, pharmacologic interventions.

The consumption of which may be associated with some underlining risk factor depending on the quantity consumed per time. Alcohol can be consumed raw or by mixing in beverages, and whenever an alcoholic beverage is consumed, it can take about an hour for the body to metabolize one-eight of an imperial gallon. The level of the blood alcohol is increased when the quantity of alcohol consumed exceeds the normal dose which the body could metabolize, and then intoxication sets it. The higher the blood alcohol concentration, the higher the risk of diseases associated with the liver, kidney, and pancreas and the abundance of free radicals in the body system. Excessive use of alcohol can lead to alcoholism or alcohol dependence. Withdrawal from which can be life-threatening. Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are the three approved oral medications for the treatment of alcoholism or alcohol dependence. On the other hand, moderate consumption of alcohol or red wines has been confirmed to be beneficial to human health particularly because of the antioxidant properties it confers.",

      "title": "Is Coffee a Useful Source of Caffeine Preexercise?",
      "abstract": "Caffeine is a well-established ergogenic aid, with its performance-enhancing effects demonstrated across a wide variety of exercise modalities. Athletes tend to frequently consume caffeine as a performance enhancement method in training and competition. There are a number of methods available as a means of consuming caffeine around exercise, including caffeine anhydrous, sports drinks, caffeine carbohydrate gels, and gum. One popular method of caffeine ingestion in nonathletes is coffee, with some evidence suggesting it is also utilized by athletes. In this article, we discuss the research pertaining to the use of coffee as an ergogenic aid, exploring (a) whether caffeinated coffee is ergogenic, (b) whether dose-matched caffeinated coffee provides a performance benefit similar in magnitude to caffeine anhydrous, and (c) whether decaffeinated coffee consumption affects the ergogenic effects of a subsequent isolated caffeine dose. There is limited evidence that caffeinated coffee has the potential to offer ergogenic effects similar in magnitude to caffeine anhydrous; however, this requires further investigation. Coingestion of caffeine with decaffeinated coffee does not seem to limit the ergogenic effects of caffeine. Although caffeinated coffee is potentially ergogenic, its use as a preexercise caffeine ingestion method represents some practical hurdles to athletes, including the consumption of large volumes of liquid and difficulties in quantifying the exact caffeine dose, as differences in coffee type and brewing method may alter caffeine content. The use of caffeinated coffee around exercise has the potential to enhance performance, but athletes and coaches should be mindful of the practical limitations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: To describe the adverse effects associated with energy drink consumption among adolescents and young adults. Data sources: Review of literature utilizing Medscape, the Internet, MD Consult, and CINAHL. The following search terms were used: Energy drinks, caffeine, guarana, taurine, ginseng, sugar, and caffeine toxicity. Search was limited to English language sources from 2005 to 2010. Conclusions: The popularity of energy drinks and the rapid growth of their excessive consumption among adolescents and young adults have brought about great concern in regards to overall health and well‐being. Caffeine, which is readily available to minors, is the most commonly used psychoactive substance in the world and imposes a potentially harmful influence on health, academic performance, and personal adjustments. Teens and young adults account for nearly $2.3 billion of energy drink sales. Adolescents and young adults are often unaware that various products, such as energy drinks, herbal medications, and various other medications that promote alertness, contain caffeine. When these products are taken together, caffeine toxicity and severe adverse effects can occur. Implications for practice: Practitioners need to be aware of the consequences of energy drink consumption and be prepared to provide appropriate patient education.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol is arguably the oldest drug known to man, its use dating back at least 10,000 yr to the dawn of human civilization (1). Although illicit drug use often receives more attention in contemporary society, alcohol abuse exacts a devastating toll: In the United States at present, over 7% of the population meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or alcoholism (2), over 28% of children under 18 yr of age are exposed to alcohol abuse or dependence in the home (3), and the overall economic cost to society of alcohol abuse has been estimated at $ 185 billion (4). Despite intensive research since the latter part of the previous century, it is clear that the biological actions that are responsible for the characteristic effects of ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, on human physiology and behavior are still incompletely understood. Because of the simple chemical structure of ethanol (it differs from water only by two methylene groups) and its low potency (it produces most of its biological effects at millimolar concentrations), alcohol undoubtedly interacts with multiple sites in the central nervous system. The biological effects of alcohol almost certainly reflect its concerted actions at a number of these sites. Of the many possible targets of alcohol actions, neurotransmitter receptors, and in particular, neurotransmitter-gated receptor-ion channels are currently believed to be among the most important (5). Because the neurotransmitter glutamate mediates the majority of fast excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system via actions on glutamate-gated receptor-ion channels (6), effects of alcohol on these ion channels could profoundly alter central nervous system function.",

A pilot or surgeon might consume an amount of alcohol that might be appropriate at a dinner party, yet dangerous before a flight or an operation. Likewise, the same applies to individuals taking certain medications, or persons with certain brain conditions or who are at an age that may cause impairment by amounts that would be benign for others. These and other complexities have contributed to the development of special training and specialty status in the field. Interested persons can contact the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Association of Psychiatrists in Alcoholism and the Addictions. I concur with Dr Ireland that on the basis of lifetime risk, alcohol abuse remains the major substance abuse within our profession. By",

The relaxation procedure described by Benson was used as the principal treatment. Reinforcement cards for nonsmoking and elimination of caffeine were also used. The subject was successful in reducing her caffeine intake and completely extinguished use of cigarettes. She reported that she was still practicing the relaxation procedure 1 yr. later. Apparently these procedures can be helpful in modifying use of cigarettes and caffeine.",

      "abstract": "Stress management is the need of the hour. However hard we try to go beyond a stress situation, life seems to find new ways of stressing us out and plaguing us with anxiety attacks.There can be innumerable stress factors since different individuals react differently to the same stress conditions. The brain doesn’t differentiate between real and imagined stress. Failure in adopting a realistic attitude to events creates symptoms of depression and aggravates stress situations.Do “stressed out” parents necessarily have stressed out kids? Besides being at higher genetic risk for stress, children of stressed parents can also learn the tendency to get stressed out in reaction to life’s challenges from their parents.”Children of stressed out parents are more likely to be ill equipped to handle stressors positively. Research shows that nicotine dependency actually increases stress levels in smokers-adults and adolescence alike. Adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking. The repeated occurrence of stressed moods between smoking means that smokers tend to experience distinctly above-average levels of daily stress. When adults quit smoking, they become less stressed rather than more stressed. Reduces stress hormones (studies shows, laughter induces reduction of at least four of neuroendocrine hormones—epinephrine, cortisol, dopac, and growth hormone, associated with stress response).It is well known that either a quick or constant stress can induce risky mind-body disorders. Stressed out individuals carry a great deal of physical tension in their bodies. Under stress the stiff muscles restrict the circulation of blood. Yogic asanas, meditation and breathing can help stress affected persons in many ways such as:(1)Reduce stress and tension, and (2) Mindfulness meditation helps stress reduction, improving physical and mental health.",

      "title": "The physiology of willpower",
      "abstract": "Past research indicates that self-control relies on some sort of limited energy source. This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior.",

Caffeine, a relatively safe psychostimulant substance consumed as dietary products or daily drinks, enhances physical and mental performance. According to long‐lasting safe experiences of daily coffee consumption, caffeine intoxication with a cup of coffee is hardly believable in Iran. This paper reports five cases of coffee toxicity with a single cup of coffee within the last weeks. Presentation of toxicity varied among patients and ranged from lethargy to hallucination, tremors, agitation, shortness of breath, and decreased level of consciousness. Surprisingly, all five patients consumed an unknown caffeinated beverage called Death Coffee within 12 weeks, demonstrating that a new and unknown beverage prevails in our region.",

However, longitudinal studies that unravel cohort from aging effects observe that when people age, they generally limit alcohol use. There is much heterogeneity in changes in alcohol use among older adults. Physical changes in ability to metabolize alcohol, changing policies toward alcohol use, the higher exposure to risk factors that may induce problem drinking and increased morbidity all contribute to this heterogeneity. The overall picture that the new generation of older people drinks more than previous generations warrants increased attention for older problem drinkers.",

      "abstract": "Mfoumou et al. raise several excellent points. Cigarettes are predominant form of tobacco consumption in the world accounting for over 95% of total tobacco consumption. Numerous compounds in tobacco smoke can lead to the development and progression of cancer.1 Nicotine and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) are important contributors to the effects of tobacco on tumor progression.2 Nicotine and activation of nAChRs can increase tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition.3-5 Nicotine decreases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo.6, 7 As discussed by Mfoumou et al., water pipe smoke (also referred to as a “hookah”) contains a significant number of similar toxic compounds as cigarette smoke. Even a single use of water pipe smoke can result in significant increases in carbon monoxide, nicotine and tobacco specific nitrosamines,8 also known to activate nAChRs.3 Although current evidence demonstrates that tobacco use is detrimental to cancer treatment outcome, more objective assessments of tobacco use would substantially increase the depth of our understanding of the relationship between tobacco and cancer progression.9 Unfortunately, the assessment of tobacco use and tobacco cessation in ongoing clinical trials is substantially deficient.10 As a result, considerable work remains to accurately assess the true effect of tobacco on cancer progression. Additional studies are certainly needed to assess the role of tobacco, especially combustible forms of tobacco, on cancer progression. We concur with Mfoumou et al. that this deficiency needs to be addressed with biologic studies and in ongoing cancer clinical trials. Yours sincerely, Graham W. Warren Mary E. Reid K.

      "abstract": "The electronic cigarette (EC) is battery-powered electronic nicotine delivery systems that appear very similar to a conventional cigarette. EC is a rising phenomenon that is becoming gradually more popular among smokers worldwide. Vapers report use of EC helps them to quit smoking, and to reduce cigarette consumption. Although available evidence indicates that EC is safer alternative to smoking there is emerging data that suggests otherwise and that considerable health benefits are likely in smokers who switch from tobacco to EC. The key motivation among most of the vapers is smoking cessation (SC), however some use it for recreational purposes. Progression is often related to EC resembling traditional cigarettes, curiosity, and experimentation. Studies indicate that the content of the nicotine in EC is equivalent to oral nicotine replacement therapy products and causes minimal possibility of poisoning. The inhaled compounds associated with EC results in cytotoxicity and affect various organs. The considerable risk associated with the use and abuse of nicotine refill bottles has been reported. Large scale research will help make EC more effective as smoking substitutes. Although previous data shows that EC can considerably decrease cigarette consumption without causing significant side effects, there is emerging data suggesting the potentially toxic consequences of EC, which necessitates the urgent need for further research in that regard. The focus of the present article is use, the safety of EC and its effectiveness to provide as a long-term substitute for SC.",

      "title": "La cigarette électronique : renormalisons-nous le tabagisme en public? Anéantir cinq décennies de lutte contre le tabac et revitaliser la dépendance à la nicotine chez les enfants et les adolescents du Canada",
      "abstract": "La cigarette électronique (vapoteuse) est une batterie fixée à un réservoir rempli d’un liquide qui peut (ou non) contenir de la nicotine. La batterie réchauffe le liquide et le convertit en vapeur, qui est inhalée afin d’imiter le tabagisme. La source de nicotine de la vapoteuse ne provient pas du tabac, mais le dispositif vaporise un liquide en vue de son inhalation. Ces e-liquides, souvent aromatisés, peuvent contenir de la nicotine sous diverses concentrations, mais leur quantité réelle est rarement bien indiquée sur l’emballage. Les effets délétères de la nicotine sur la santé sont bien établis dans le groupe d’âge pédiatrique. Le vapotage est en hausse au sein de ce groupe au Canada, de même que les intoxications à la nicotine qui y sont associées. Les vapoteuses produisent de grandes quantités de particules fines, de toxines et de métaux lourds, à des taux qui peuvent dépasser ceux de la cigarette conventionnelle. Les enfants et les adolescents sont particulièrement susceptibles à ces produits atomisés. Il faut agir avant que ces dispositifs deviennent un danger mieux établi en santé publique. Cette nouvelle « porte d’accès » à la dépendance à la nicotine pourrait saboter les politiques visant à « dénormaliser » le tabagisme dans la société, ainsi que les réductions historiques de consommation du tabac.",

      "abstract": "Older people consult their doctors less than younger people in relation to both their reported morbidity and their prescribed medication. Some of the large iceberg of symptoms among the elderly might respond to a modification of their current drug regimens. Assessments of medicine taking patterns among the elderly revealed various inadequacies in supervision and a substantial proportion of questionable prescribing. General practitioners were often unaware that elderly patients lived alone, or that they drank alcohol or drove—even when they were taking prescribed medicines for which drinking or driving were contraindicated. Just over a third of elderly people were taking prescribed medicines of which their general practitioners were apparently unaware. The way doctors prescribe for their elderly patients and supervise this prescribing is suggested as a suitable field for audit. The completeness of their records in relation to prescriptions, drinking, driving, and living alone is another possible area for study. So too is the home visiting of the very elderly, particularly those living alone.",

      "abstract": "Since their introduction to the European beverage industry 25 years ago and to the United States more than 10 years ago, energy drinks have been gaining popularity, especially among adolescent and young adult consumers. Currently, there are over 300 different energy drinks on the market [1], with new beverages being added regularly. Energy drinks are widely touted for their ability to increase energy levels and enhance cognitive and athletic performance. By promoting this aspect, the consumer marketing of energy drinks frequently targets the 18–35-year-old demographic. With popular lore conveying the expectation that caffeine will counteract the sedating effects of alcohol, energy drinks have become increasingly popular to mix with alcohol, especially in young adults. This is demonstrated by a survey revealing that, of college students who had consumed alcohol in the last 30 days, almost one-quarter reported doing so in combination with an energy drink [2]. Despite the frequency of use, there are several concerns regarding the consumption of energy drinks mixed with alcohol including increased absorption of alcohol, drinking higher volumes of alcohol per drinking session and drinking alcohol more frequently, decreased awareness of alcohol-related impairment, and increased rates of alcohol-related consequences.",

      "abstract": "A major problem facing physicians involved in the daily care of amateur athletes in international competition is that of so-called doping. While there are many substances used that might be considered ineffectual or physiologic, the two main categories of substances considered as doping agents are stimulants and anabolic steroids. No substance is as yet known that will improve an athlete's performance. Often such substances are taken in error rather than in a misguided attempt to improve one's ability. These substances can be dangerous and, because of this, doping rules were established basically to protect the athlete. Anabolic steroids are particularly dangerous; they usually are taken by those engaged in lifting or throwing sports in an attempt to improve performance by increasing muscle bulk. There is as yet no scientific proof that performance is improved. Dope testing for stimulants should be carried out in a quantitative rather than qualitative manner so that the athlete who has taken a small amount of a so-called stimulant (such as an asthma or common cold preparation) would not be excluded from competition. Rigid testing for anabolic steroids should be continued.",

Passive smokers are people exposed to cigarette smoke in two ways : by direct exposure to the smoke of passively burning cigarette and exposure to the smoke breathed out by the smoker. Second-hand smoke is the mixture of direct smoke from burning a cigarette along with the smoke breathed out from the smoker’s lungs. As a result, side stream smoke has higher concentration of some toxic and carcinogenic substances than the mainstream smoke. When exposed to second hand smoke, non-smokers inhale 60-80% of airborne nicotine similar to that absorbed by smokers So this review paper will elaborate about the effects of passive smoking.",

In this research current state of knowledge was examined in questionnaire on: cigarette smoke compounds, harmfulness of smoking on the skin condition and the possibilities of typical \"smoker's skin\" changes eliminating. The research shows that most smokers do not pay attention to the harmful tobacco effects on the body and as only one compound of tobacco smoke they name nicotine.

Half of the hospitalized subjects had a history of an inordinate use of alcohol; this excessive use predominated during the manic phase, a fact that does not support the popular view that alcohol is used to counteract depression. Patients themselves frequently reported a deliberale use of alcohol to decrease manic symptoms and a tendency to shun alcohol during the depressive phase. Alcohol did not seem to alter the presenting symptoms of hospitalized manic patients, since irritability and the loss of impulse control were similar among the drinkers and nondrinkers.",

Motivational interventions are valuable for increasing desire and intention to quit, but have limited success in enhancing the outcome of a cessation attempt. Dependence on nicotine is the main factor underlying maintenance of smoking, and nicotine withdrawal is a major block to successful cessation. Nicotine replacement treatment improves outcomes from intensive group support and has the potential to be combined with specific behavioural interventions. But the scope for intensive treatments is limited. Brief interventions delivered by health professionals through their contacts with patients in primary care could have a much greater effect in reducing prevalence. Such interventions have been shown to be effective in one-off research studies, but need to be incorporated into everyday routines on a sustained basis.",

      "abstract": "1. In humans, caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant 2 , having the effect of temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks and energy drinks, enjoy great popularity. Caffeine is the world’s most widely consumed psychoactive substance, estimated at 120,000 tonnes per annum 3 , but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all jurisdictions. The half-life of caffeine — the time required for the body to eliminate one-half of the total amount of caffeine — varies widely among individuals according to such factors as age, liver function, pregnancy, some concurrent medications, and the level of enzymes in the liver needed for caffeine metabolism. In healthy adults, caffeine’s half-life is approximately 3-4 hours. The average daily consumption of caffeine among Americans is 219 mg. 4 Adults receive nearly three quarters of their daily caffeine from coffee. Children receive one half of their caffeine from soft drinks. Energy drinks represent a fastgrowing beverage market. A combination of caffeine and herbal ingredients are touted as providing an energy boost. Energy drinks vary in the amount of caffeine included in their formulations and can range from around 50-300 mg. Consumers seeking the activating qualities of caffeine in pill form can find many preparations, the more well known having 200 mg. Individuals worldwide consume about 76 mg of caffeine per day. Most people experience no behavioral effects with less than 300 mg caffeine. Sleep is more sensitive and can be disrupted by 200 mg caffeine. At doses exceeding 1 g per day, susceptible individuals experience toxic effects. The caffeine content in some common sources of caffeine is listed below (Table1).",

But there are others who crash and burn, or at least smolder, especially those in early adolescence. The largest community focused on concern for a loved one’s harmful involvement with alcohol and other drugs is found in Al-Anon Family Groups, which focus on maintaining understanding of the drug-induced neurologically-based salience of marijuana for their loved one and feeling compassion for their addiction. Al-Anon embodies the principle that we are powerless to force an addict to think differently, though we can educate ourselves about addiction, encourage them toward health, present factual information and reflect reality for them. We can learn nonjudgmental ways to respond to their denial, myths and rationalizations. Parental authority also stems from parental integrity – living a life that embodies what you hope children will learn. When adolescents refuse to stop using marijuana despite their parents’ firm insistence, a process of contracting for privileges and consequences can be useful.",

      "title": "Vaping culture: An emerging epidemic and its impact",
      "abstract": "Madam, Over the past decade, vaping––defined as the inhalation of aerosolized nicotine produced by electronic cigarettes (“e-cigarettes”) has become prevalent among teenagers and adolescents. The modern designs, social acceptance, and wide variety of flavours have made vaping increasingly convenient, accessible, and appealing to young people. Combined with a lack of awareness about their long-term side effects, this has contributed to their growing allure compared to traditional cigarettes (1). In Pakistan, 6.2% of individuals use e-cigarettes. Originally marketed as a less harmful alternative to smoking and a cessation aid, Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) also gained popularity because some smoking cessation pills are carcinogenic (2). Although e-liquids pose a lower threat than conventional cigarettes, they still carry significant health risks that require attention. Particularly concerning is their impact on the respiratory system with association with conditions such as aggravated asthma, bronchitis, altering pulmonary function, and cognitive impairment. Users are likely to be exposed to heavy metals from the device, which may be carcinogenic or toxic to the heart and lungs. Additionally, ingredients present in the e-liquids, such as propylene glycol, can irritate the respiratory tract. Beyond physical health, vaping has also been linked to mental health problems in adolescents, including anxiety, depression, and ADHD (3). Nicotine exposure can disrupt brain development, increasing the potential of developing nicotine addiction, along with the gateway hypothesis, which suggests that e-liquids might lead to the use of more harmful substances like cigarettes and cannabis, thus undermining the very practice it was intended to avoid. This highlights the misleading nature of the product’s advertising (4). To protect future generations from the dangers of this growing trend, preventive measures are essential. Despite limited research on prevention, key public health policies should be introduced. These include allocating resources for additional research, prohibiting marketing aimed at younger demographics, and establishing an ID system to restrict purchases to individuals 18 and older. Products should be sold only through licensed retailers, and an additional tax on e-cigarettes should be implemented, along with required warning labels on each device, to discourage sales. Public awareness campaigns should educate the public, and educational programs should aim to alter the perception of vaping among students, emphasizing its negative consequences. These efforts should collectively work toward shifting the social perception of vaping from normalized to disapproved, akin to smoking (2).",

Energy drinks have become widely used by students preparing for exams, office workers who do not have time to submit their work on time, fitness trainers trying to set a sports record, tired drivers. Today, the opinions of scientists and experts are divided: some consider \"energy drinks\" to be quite harmless, like regular soda; others, on the contrary, argue that they can act like drugs, and are certainly addictive and dependent. Many energy drinks on sale contain caffeine, taurine, plant extracts and synthetic vitamins. Taking psychostimulants containing large amounts of caffeine or synthetic compounds has a number of limitations due to the fact that their intake into the body can cause not only stimulation of performance, but also a paradoxical decrease in it, even to the point of depression. It has been shown that the central nervous system is most affected. Based on the analysis of literary data, it can be concluded that energy drinks remain one of the most pressing problems in health care today. Despite the fact that there are already more than enough preliminary observations about the potential and real danger of systematic use of legal neurostimulants in energy drinks, to obtain a clear evidence base to justify practical recommendations for regulating the sale (volumes and dosages) of energy drinks, it is necessary to conduct an experimental, fundamental study on animals.",

The toxic effect of ethanol, withdrawal from alcohol, nutritional deficits, and electrolyte disturbances, as well as liver damage, may contribute to the ethiopathogenesis of brain injury. The susceptibility of the brain to the negative effects of alcohol may be influenced by sex and age. The role of genetic factors and interactions of several licit and illicit drugs with alcohol needs further investigation.",

There is little doubt that these effects reinforce drinking of alcoholic beverages, play a significant role in alcohol abuse and may contribute significantly to the development of alcohol dependence.

The anxiolytic actions of ethanol have been demonstrated experimentally employing anticonflict tests (Dalterio et al., 1988; Koob et al., 1984).",

Alcohol is generally approved, other drugs are generally disapproved. The mass media of communication reflect this definition. A recent shift, however, has been noted. Several televised situation comedies have presented marijuana in a new way—as a humorous plaything, a relatively harmless escape from the cares and boredom of life. Examples are given and the cases are analyzed. No implication of a concerted plan is assumed. It is speculated that continuation of such a trend would have an impact on public attitudes toward marijuana, and perhaps on other drugs as well.",

De crease in renal function with age is especially important regarding the use of lithium but is also relevant for most drugs because they are eventually cleared through the kidneys after metabolism in the liver. Because pharmacodynamic changes associated with aging will make elderly patients more sensitive to the pharmacological effects of medication—especially adverse effects—nurses should be appropriately trained in pharmacology and therapeutics in older adults.",

      "title": "ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE: ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY AND RISK FOR HEALTH",
      "abstract": "A new product which is an electronic cigarette acting as nicotine delivery has been marketed at early 2000s. An electronic cigarette generates nicotine aerosol from a solution comprised of several basic substances, nicotine and flavours. The electronic cigarettes were widely promoted by a manufacturer like a safe product substituting tobacco smoking during quitting period. As a result, their consumption has been increasing progressively worldwide. Investigators of the aerosol content reported that it mainly contains ultrafine particles which easily penetrate into alveoli and blood vessels. The aerosol also contains nitrosamines, toxic substances and heavy metals. Strong evidence has been made about the aerosol cytotoxicity that could lead to serious injury and diseases. Nicotine dependence was demonstrated to develop as a result of an electronic cigarette smoking. While smoking an electronic cigarette, the indoor air concentration of toxic substances could reach hazardous levels. Electronic cigarettes do not have any advantage and cannot be considered as a mean to quit tobacco smoking. Moreover, electronic cigarette consumers were shown to quit smoking significantly harder. A large body of scientific confirmation of hazardous effect of electronic cigarettes on a human either during active or passive smoking have been obtained. It is no doubt that further investigations are needed especially with regards to rapid change in the market of electronic cigarettes. To minimize adverse effect of electronic cigarettes both on an individual and on population at whole certain measures should be undertaken intended to limitation of demand and supply of electronic cigarettes in the country similar to those for typical tobacco products.",

      "abstract": "There is no doubt that the type, amount, composition, and timing of food intake can Dramatically affect exercise performance, recovery from exercise, body weight and Composition and health. When exercise or physical work increase to more than 1 hour per day, the importance of adequate energy and nutrient intakes becomes more critical. As the American public becomes more concerned with health and health issues, the interest in nutrition and physical activity has increased. This interest in health has also heightened the sale of supplements, herbal preparations, and weight loss products, all aimed at improving health, preventing or curing disease, improving sport performance, and changing body composition and weight. Sports nutrition’s the practical science of hydrating and fuelling before, during and after exercise. Executed properly, sports nutrition can help promote optimal training and performance. Done incorrectly or ignored, it can derail training and hamper performance. Active individuals need more energy (calories) each day than their sedentary counterparts assuming individuals are the same age, body size and participate in similar non-physically active daily activities. Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance means that active individuals need to replace the water and electrolytes lost in sweat. Nearly 25% of Americans use dietary supplements daily and ~35-40% use themoccasionally. For individuals engaged in physical activity, the estimates are as high as 50-100% (Sobal & Marquart, 1994). We now know that what you eat and drink can significantly impact health andexercise performance. The active individual needs to make sure they consumeenough energy to maintain a healthy body weight for their activity level and sport, while reducing risks of chronic disease. Active individuals need more carbohydrate and protein than sedentary individuals, and should not restrict fat intake too severely. Keeping well-hydrated and replacing fluids lost during exercise is also a key part of feeling good and performing at one’s best. Active individuals dieting for weight loss may need to supplement, but in general supplements should be used with caution and after careful examination of the diet.",

E-cigarettes are often tried out before traditional cigarettes, are easily available and regarded as harmless by adolescents. Studies increasingly show negative health effects of regular e-cigarette use, including the risk of becoming a smoker of traditional cigarettes and nicotine addiction. N20 use has also become increasingly popular, and follows after cannabis and ecstasy use in prevalence rates. As with e-cigarette use, most users are not aware of potential health risks of N20 use, while particularly longer-term and heavy use may yield negative neurological and psychiatric effects. The misconception of risks, and high availability of both inhalants warrant better education to prevent poor outcomes.",

Their intestinal transit time has been shown to be normal. Nevertheless about fifty percent of the elderly use laxatives. In the very old and in institutions the use is even more frequent. The main cause of this real or supposed constipation is the lack of dietary fibre in the food. In the aged constipation can have dangerous complications, e.g. acute mental confusion, urinary retention, urinary incontinence and fecal impaction. Treatment may include general measurements, the addition of bulk-laxatives to the diet and the prescription of other laxatives. The use of laxatives other than bulk-laxatives may cause many harmful side-effects in the aged. The daily food must contain sufficient dietary fibre. Failing this one can use bran, preparations of psyllium or lactulose syrup.",

Despite primary prevention and cessation-based policies and interventions, quit rates are low and nicotine replacement therapies are underused and of limited efficacy. Tobacco harm reduction has garnered attention due to tobacco policy shifts and the increasing use and marketing of such products as electronic cigarettes. Social work has been criticized as ignoring this topic, and existing literature is limited. This article considers questions and concerns surrounding tobacco harm reduction, and offers guidance in formulating a social work position regarding this important issue.",

Long-term studies in humans have confirmed that children of binge-drinking mothers exhibited especially severe cognitive and behavioral deficits. Binge drinking may be particularly harmful because it results in high BACs, may occur during critical periods of brain development, and may be associated with repeated withdrawal episodes.",

L’uso cronico, determina assuefazione e dipendenza producendo una sindrome da astinenza. Un uso acuto a dosaggi superiori a 300 mg puo determinare una intossicazione con sintomi eccitatori sia a carico del sistema nervoso che dell’apparato cardiocircolatorio.

      "title": "Use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy in Young People Entering Custody in New South Wales, Australia",
      "abstract": "Haysom et al. found low rates of uptake and compliance with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) among young people who smoke tobacco entering correctional facilities.1 As the authors note, this is not surprising and reflects the findings of other studies.2 Management of nicotine dependence in adolescence is problematic. NRT has not been shown to be effective in this age group and bupropion and varenicline are not approved. In the study by Haysom et al., the fixed dose of nicotine used was probably inadequate for many smokers as only 14 mg or 7 mg patches were used. Combination NRT (nicotine patch combined with a quick acting product such as nicotine gum or lozenge) is considered best practice but was not available. Other options, which are more acceptable to young smokers, are clearly needed to manage nicotine dependence in custody. One novel but controversial form therapy which is popular among young smokers is electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).3 These battery-operated devices heat nicotine liquid into a vapour for inhalation and can alleviate cigarette cravings and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Unlike nicotine patches, the dose of nicotine can be titrated to individual needs. As well as delivering nicotine, e-cigarettes can satisfy the behavioural and sensory aspects of the smoking ritual. Furthermore, as there is no combustion, e-cigarettes are substantially safer than smoking tobacco.4 Special disposable e-cigarettes have been designed for high security environments and are being used in prisons in the UK and USA. They can provide long-term substitution for combustible cigarettes in custody and may help to prevent relapse to smoking after release. E-cigarettes may be a more acceptable solution than existing treatments for managing nicotine dependence in young people in custody, especially when other treatments are refused or are not effective.",

      "title": "Differential Effects of THC and CBD in Cannabis Smokers",
      "abstract": "Cannabis contains a myriad of different chemicals, more than 60 of which are unique to the plant and called cannabinoids. The main psychoactive ingredient is delta 9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and this produces the effects that users seek (Curran et al., 2002 Psychopharmacology 164: 61-70). When given intravenously to healthy humans, THC produces psychotic-like and anxiogenic effects (D’Souza et al., 2004 Neuropsychopharmacology 29: 1558-1572). In contrast, cannabidiol (CBD), another major constituent of most strains of cannabis, appears to have anti-psychotic properties, is anxiolytic (Guimares et al., 1990 Psychopharmacology 100: 558-559)and may be neuroprotective in humans (Hermann et al., 2007 Biol. Psychiatry 61: 1281-1289). The relative THC/CBD ratio of cannabis varies greatly. Although high THC cannabis has become increasingly available over recent years, little is known on changes in levels of other cannabinoids as these are seldom measured. One study in the U.S. however found that the THC content of cannabis trebled in resin and doubled in leaf, whilst the average level of other cannabinoids, including CBD, remained unchanged. We recently found that users with high levels of THC in hair and little CBD demonstrated greater levels of schizophrenia like symptoms than users with higher levels of CBD (Morgan &amp; Curran, 2008, Br J. Psychiatry , 192: 306-307). We are currently exploring the relationship between cannabinoids in naturalistically smoked cannabis and the acute and chronic effects of the drug. This presentation will focus on the implications of the increased ratio of THC/CBD and the different effects of CBD and THC in cannabis smokers.",

      "title": "The Current Smokeless Tobacco Trend in Bangladesh",
      "abstract": "Although many smokers believe that using smokeless tobacco is safer than smoking, numerous health hazards are associated with its use. Toxins are present in all cigarette products. Because these products are seen as a part of the cultural heritage, there is little enthusiasm for their regulation throughout South and South-East Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc. Nearly 80% of users live in these areas, which could negatively impact their social, physical, and emotional health. According to several studies, quitting smoking may make people crave smokeless tobacco even more. However, they began using smokeless tobacco as a recreational activity but ultimately developed physical health conditions like gastritis, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, mouth cancer, and carcinoma of the liver. Additionally, they had medical and mental illnesses like melancholy, addiction, stress, mental anguish, and even suicidal thoughts, among others. Since it is harmful, smokeless tobacco should be handled with care. Unfortunately, our policy has not been upgraded or even had the legislation and regulation system applied. In order to alleviate this susceptible problem for the betterment of the country, it is now vital to take emergency steps to concentrate on &amp; conduct preventive comprehensive action at every level from the government &amp; local concern authorities.",

      "title": "Edible marijuana products and potential risks for pediatric populations",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review In recent years, an increasing number of states have legalized marijuana, also known as cannabis, for recreational use. As marijuana becomes more accessible, adolescent use and accidental pediatric exposures are likely to become broad public health concerns. Edible marijuana products, which are consumable foods or beverages that contain cannabis extract, are particularly enticing to youth, as they come in appealing forms such as candies, cookies, and drinks. The purpose of this review is to provide pediatricians with an overview of the different types and potential dangers associated with edible marijuana products. Recent findings Edible marijuana products are often indistinguishable in appearance from normal food items and lack the smell and visible smoke associated with inhaled marijuana. Because they are inconspicuous, palatable, and easily accessible, they are increasingly popular among adolescents. Additionally, the packaging of edible baked goods, candies, and drinks is often purposefully very similar to that of mainstream foods, increasing the risk of accidental ingestion by children. An edible marijuana product must be digested before Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol can enter the bloodstream, so there is a delayed onset of effects when consuming edibles compared with inhaling marijuana. This also predisposes users to accidental overconsumption. Summary Greater knowledge of edible marijuana product consumption by pediatric populations will allow pediatricians to more effectively help patients and advise caregivers in cases of overconsumption, dependence, or accidental ingestion. It is important for parents, guardians, and educators to be able to successfully identify edible marijuana products and recognize signs of cannabis use.",

      "title": "Sleep: A Nightmare",
      "abstract": "Common Causes of Sleeplessness Include: (1) Stress – Concerns about work, school, health, finances, or family can keep your mind active at night, making it difficult to sleep. Stressful life events or trauma – such as the death or illness of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss can lead to stress. (2) Travel or work schedule – Disrupting your body’s circadian rhythms can lead to lack of sleep. Causes include jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late or early shift, or frequently changing shifts. (3) Poor sleep habits – Poor sleep habits include an irregular bedtime schedule, naps, stimulating activities before bed, an uncomfortable sleep environment, and using your bed for work, eating, or watching TV. Computers, TVs, video games, smartphones, or other screens just before bed can interfere with your sleep cycle. (4) Eating too much late in the evening – Having a light snack before bedtime is OK, but eating too much may cause you to feel physically uncomfortable while lying down. Many people also experience heartburn, a backflow of acid, and food from the stomach into the esophagus after eating, which may keep you awake. (5) Mental health disorders – Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, may disrupt your sleep. Awakening too early can be a sign of depression. (6) Medications – Many prescription drugs can interfere with sleep, such as certain antidepressants and medications for asthma or blood pressure. Many over-the-counter medications – such as some pain medications, allergy, and cold medications, and weight loss products – contain caffeine and other stimulants that can disrupt sleep. (7) Medical conditions – Examples of conditions linked with insomnia include chronic pain, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), overactive thyroid, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. (8) Sleep-related disorders – Sleep apnea causes you to stop breathing periodically throughout the night, interrupting your sleep. Restless legs syndrome causes unpleasant sensations in your legs and an almost irresistible desire to move them, which may prevent you from falling asleep. (9) Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol – Coffee, tea, cola, and other caffeinated drinks are stimulants. Drinking them in the late afternoon or evening can keep you from falling asleep at night. Nicotine in tobacco products is another stimulant that can interfere with sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often causes awakening in the middle of the night. Complications of Insomnia May Include: (1) Lower performance on the job or at school. (2) Slowed reaction time while driving and a higher risk of accidents. (3) Mental health disorders, such as depression, an anxiety disorder, or substance abuse. (4) Increased risk and severity of long-term diseases or conditions, such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Prevention: Good sleep habits can help prevent insomnia and promote sound sleep: (1) Keep your bedtime and wake time consistent from day to day, including weekends. (2) Stay active – regular activity helps promote a good night’s sleep. (3) Check your medications to see if they may contribute to insomnia. (4) Avoid or limit naps. (5) Avoid or limit caffeine and alcohol, and do not use nicotine. (6) Avoid large meals and beverages before bedtime. (7) Make your bedroom comfortable for sleep and only use it for sex or sleep. (8) Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading, or listening to soft music. Conclusion: Sleep deprivation is helping no one except the market. Brands are capitalizing on our lack of sleep, on our habits. Who are we giving excuses to, our web series can be paused, late night conversation can",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the most common preventable cause of death which has led to a search for healthier alternatives to tobacco smoke. Electronic cigarettes are devoid of many harmful constituents found in cigarette smoke and are therefore being positioned as safer alternative to tobacco smoke. The carcinogenic potential may be of lower magnitude compared with cigarette smoke, but it is still there. The use of e-cigarettes, however, is fairly new, so its long-term effects are still unknown. Moreover, they continue to posses the cardiovascular side-effects and are certainly as addicting. Thus on one hand while their substitution could lead to reduction of some side-effects of tobacco smoke, its use may be just shifting the modality of addiction and will be unlikely to lead to total abstinence from tobacco products. On the other hand there is a fear that its use could lead to loosening of the taboo currently associated with use of tobacco products and so the benefits of years of advocacy to ban tobacco products might be lost. Thus currently the scientific community is divided about role of e-cigarettes.",

Heroin, Kokain) mehr oder weniger rigoros durch. Die Cannabisprohibition wird dabei häufig damit begründet, daß ihre Durchsetzung den Konsum harter Drogen vermindert. Der Beitrag untersucht die Gültigkeit dieser These unter Verwendung von Standardannahmen der Prohibitionsbefürworter. Zur Modellierung des Konsumeinstiegs wird dazu die ökonomische Theorie der Kriminalität mit einigen empirischen Befunden der Drogenforschung kombiniert. Unter der Annahme eines sequentiellen Einstiegs in den Konsum weicher und harter Drogen zeigt eine formale Analyse, daß eine verstärkte Durchsetzung der Cannabisprohibition zu einem erhöhten Konsum harter Drogen führen kann. Sie zeigt zudem, daß eine unzureichend differenzierte Bestrafung des Konsums weicher und harter Drogen die Zahl der Konsumenten harter Drogen vergrößern kann. Insgesamt weist die Analyse damit auf Inkonsistenzen in der Standardargumentation zugunsten der Cannabisprohibition hin.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a many-headed Hydra, which grows new smokers' heads as fast as they are lopped off. Efforts to change smokers' behavior usually reach a point of diminishing returns, as evidenced by experiences in smoking withdrawal clinics and in public anti-smoking education campaigns. Obviously, many smokers are refactory to anti-smoking education, a situation which has generated a great deal of pharmacological, neurochemical, psychological, and sociological research. The National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health in the U.S.A. has used a \"gradualist\" or permissive approach in anti-smoking messages, aimed at less hazardous smoking \"if you must smoke,\" rather than at complete cessation, and found this approach to be useful. U.S.A. school-children are exposed to anti-smoking education in lower grades than formerly, when it was offered in high school. Thus a population of as yet non-smoking children is being educated. Perhaps the adult non-smokers should be enlisted in an effort to create a social climate wherein smoking is not an acceptable behavior-an approach reflecting the concept of smoking as a social disease. Health education addressed to the receptive non-smoker would circumvent the refractory smoker. A theme with appeal to non-smokers is the protest against environmental pollution by smokers. It is possible that if a movement by non-smokers against smoking would gather momentum, it could turn the present accepting social climate into one rejecting smoking, thus striking at the regeneration of the Hydra: the incessant recruitment of smokers among ex-smokers and non-smokers. With recruitment below replacement level, the Hydra would in time wither away.",

      "abstract": "Both Hispanic and college student populations smoke at non trivial rates but less frequently than other smoking groups. Limited information exists about the proximal predictors of light smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes per day, particularly among college students. Participants (N = 118 young adults) completed a 7 day Tobacco Consumption Diary by recording for each cigarette smoked: time and day, location, number of people present, number of smokers present, mood, and whether alcohol was consumed. Results suggest light smoking is most strongly associated with the alcohol intake, later time of day, and multiple locations both within and outside the social context (but not at work). The amount smoked per day by light smokers does not appear to be influenced by the number of people present and number of smokers present. Overall, young adult light smokers appear to be cue oriented in their smoking similar to heavier smokers, despite lower levels of addiction and fewer cigarettes per day than heavier smokers. Light smokers may benefit from tailored intervention approaches to identifying the ideographic triggers that occur in certain locations and later time of day and are likely to include alcohol intake.",

Eighty thousand people die every year in England from smoking.1 Many more suffer terrible disability. Tobacco control remains a public health priority.2 Smoking still kills.\n\nIn this context anything which could reduce this toll deserves serious consideration, just as any risks of undermining recent tobacco control successes need to be properly understood.\n\nIt is disappointing then that the debate on electronic cigarettes (also known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or nicotine vapourisers) has become characterised more by heat than light. There has been so much focus on these devices that we risk losing our focus on what we know works—a comprehensive strategy to reduce smoking prevalence.3 We must not lose, through neglect, the debate on standardised tobacco packaging or the need to further increase the price of tobacco. We need to move away from fixed positions to some key principles against which we can debate the evidence.\n\nThe first principle must be to ask whether electronic cigarettes are safe. First do no harm. Compared with smoking tobacco it is very clear that electronic cigarettes are much safer. Even though it is not difficult to be safer than a product which will kill half of its regular users, this message must not be lost. However, it is equally true to say that electronic cigarettes are not without harm.4 The vapour from some of these devices has been shown to contain ultrafine particles and carcinogens.

      "abstract": "In the hope of reducing the adverse health consequences of smoking, physicians frequently advise their patients who cannot quit to smoke fewer cigarettes. Habitual smokers may compensate for the reduced number of cigarettes, however, by taking in more smoke per cigarette. We measured the intake of tar (estimated as mutagenic activity of the urine), nicotine, and carbon monoxide during short-term cigarette restriction. With a reduction from an average of 37 cigarettes to an average of 5 cigarettes per day, the intake of tobacco toxins per cigarette increased roughly threefold and daily exposure to tar and carbon monoxide declined only 50 percent. We conclude that smoking fewer cigarettes may reduce exposure to toxins and related adverse health consequences. However, consistent with a tendency to maintain intake of nicotine, the magnitude of the benefit is much less than expected. Whether \"oversmoking\" persists during long-term restriction of cigarettes requires further investigation.",

      "abstract": "One of the mysteries of drug addiction is why people start to use drugs that are known to be addictive. Prior research has found that people generally under-predict the impact on their own future preferences of visceral states, such as hunger, thirst and fear that they are not currently experiencing. Based on this research, we hypothesized that people who are not currently craving a drug - even addicts who have experienced craving frequently in the past - will under-appreciate the impact of craving on their own future preferences. To test this prediction, we elicited the money value that addicts placed on an extra dose of the heroin substitute Buprenorphine, when they were either in a state of craving (right before receiving BUP) or in a drug-satiated state (right after receiving BUP). In the most important condition, the reward they ended up receiving - either money or BUP - would be delayed by 5 days. As would be predicted if addicts can't remember what craving is like when they aren't currently craving, addicts valued the extra dose of BUP to be received 5 days later more highly when they were craving than when they were satiated.",

On public transport, in restaurants and the cinema the unpleasant and uncomfortable effects of smoking are often no longer tolerated.

In most organisations it is recognised that a total ban would be heavy‐handed and potentially disruptive. Recent developments show, however, that non‐smokers are becoming increasingly assertive in their demands for smoking control. Facilities managers, with their colleagues in the personnel department, will have to respond so that the right of non‐smokers to a pollution‐free working environment can be reconciled with the needs of smokers to indulge their addiction.",

In other words, given a free choice we are generally discriminative and select those foods and drinks which give us most pleasure. However, we must also recognise that the majority of us try to live our lives with the least effort and as discrimination involves effort it is not surprising that a large majority of consumers approach the selection and appreciation of food at best subconsciously or even, with the ever increasing pressures of today, unconsciously.",

      "title": "Es el tratamiento farmacológico aislado una buena opción para el tabaquismo",
      "abstract": "Introduccion: El tabaquismo es un problema de salud que causa la muerte a mas de un millon de personas en America Latina cada ano, a pesar de tener un caracter evitable y sobre el cual la propaganda es amplia y en la mayoria muy sugestiva. La adiccion comienza generalmente en la adolescencia por ser esta una edad en la que la imitacion y la necesidad de ser aceptado en el grupo, se convierten en las principales causas para iniciar el habito de fumar. El exacto mecanismo de la accion del cese del mal habito tabaquico no esta aclarado, se piensa que es mediado por los efectos noradrenergico y/o dopaminergicos. Se han empleado medicamentos que actuan indirectamente o mas directamente en el mismo tal como el Bupropion, que aumenta las concentraciones de dopamina extracelular en el nucleo accumbens, como ocurre con todas las sustancias adictivas conocidas incluso la nicotina. El nucleus accumbens, una parte del sistema de dopamina mesolimbico, puede ser un componente importante del circuito neural de gratificacion. En el centro donde se realiza el estudio, este fenomeno continua siendo un problema de salud que es necesario atender educativamente y a traves de acciones administrativas que garanticen el cumplimiento de las medidas que estan establecidas por el Ministerio de Salud Publica(MINSAP). El presente trabajo contempla los resultados preliminares alcanzados, despues de haber aplicado una estrategia en el grupo de fumadores identificados y que se mostraron dispuestos a recibir ayuda especializada para la deshabituacion. Hipotesis: El Bupropion como monoterapia no constituye la mejor opcion en el tratamiento de los pacientes con tabaquismo. Material y metodos: El universo esta constituido por 19 trabajadores fumadores dispuestos a dejar de fumar y por los criterios de inclusion y exclusion, (cantidad de cigarrillos fumados diariamente, el tiempo de adiccion a la nicotina y que no tuvieran padecimiento de enfermedad epileptica u otra enfermedad convulsivante) escogimos 12 fumadores. Se medicaron segun criterio clinico, con 75mg de Bupropion y a la semana se incremento a 150mg a los que no habian disminuido la cantidad de cigarrillos consumidos al dia. Resultados: De los 19 pacientes que en la encuesta exploratoria que le precedio a este trabajo, dijeron que querian dejar de fumar, 12 fueron tratados con Bupropion. De ellos, disminuyeron la cantidad de cigarrillos durante el tratamiento 8 pacientes y 4 pacientes continuaron fumando igual o mas cantidad de cigarrillos. En la discusion de los resultados, se destaca el hecho de que la mejoria en cuanto a la disminucion de la cantidad de cigarrillos fumados solo se puso de manifiesto durante el tratamiento avalado ademas, porque 4 pacientes tratados con la dosis maxima del medicamento continuaron fumando igual o mas. Conclusiones: La muestra seleccionada manifiesta insuficiente informacion sobre las consecuencias del habito de fumar, aunque se evidencia una actitud favorable en general, ante la posibilidad de la deshabituacion. Debemos continuar haciendo enfasis en las medidas preventivas para impedir que personas que no fuman adquieran el habito, Esto es parte de la estrategia encaminada a luchar contra el tabaquismo. La combinacion de tecnicas psicoterapeuticas con la de sustitucion de la nicotina sigue siendo a nuestro juicio la mejor eleccion.",

This type of definition is most often compared to a zero-tolerance policy that aims to eliminate all recreational drug abuse by legal and other means.

Patients often wonder if there is anything they can do to optimize their natural fertility or increase the effectiveness of infertility treatments.If there is a clear impact on fertility, such as with smoking and alcohol, cessation should be advised. Similarly, weight loss should be recommended if the BMI is in the overweight and obese category, and weight gain should be recommended for an underweight BMI. The evidence surrounding other lifestyle modifications is less clear. There are conflicting data regarding an optimal fertility diet and consumption of vitamins and supplements. Antioxidants seem to improve semen parameters in men, but the effect on female fertility is less clear. If conflicting evidence exists, such as with caffeine consumption or exercise, moderation should be emphasized. Finally, the diagnosis of infertility and subsequent fertility treatments are stressful for both partners. The psychological aspects should not be ignored and methods such as yoga and cognitive behavioral therapy may be beneficial.Continued research will determine the optimal lifestyle modifications to achieve pregnancy.",

Anne Joseph:There is no doubt that quitting smoking has health benefits with respect to lung disease and many other conditions.Whether it has good, bad, or no effects on chemical dependency outcomes is still up in the air, unfortunately.For a long time there were worries, not founded on any data, that there would be adverse effects.There have been about a dozen studies that did not seem to demonstrate such effects, and a few suggested smoking cessation might even have a beneficial effect on treatment outcomes.Lirio Covey: Most of the evidence has been on recovered groups, and it shows that if people quit smoking after being abstinent from alcohol for a while, quitting smoking does not jeopardize that abstinence.Dr. Sharp and colleagues, however, are talking about people in early recovery.We know very little about how smoking cessation will affect that group.I have some concerns.I see a parallel to the state of our knowledge with regard to smoking and psychiatric conditions such as major depression.We know a lot about people with past major depression.But we don't know what will happen if people stop smoking when they are still depressed or just recently got over their depression. Joseph:We just completed a randomized trial of treatment for nicotine dependence given concurrently with alcohol treatment, comparing it to nicotine treatment delayed by 6 months.The smoking cessation outcomes were identical in the two groups, in the neighborhood of 15 or 16 percent at 12 months.However, there is sometimes a trend and sometimes a statistically significant difference in alcohol treatment outcomes that favors delayed treatment.This is not the result we were expecting.Covey: Anne, can you speculate on the explanation for your finding?Joseph: One possibility has to do with pharmacological interactions between nicotine craving and alcohol craving.For example, abstinence from cigarettes may cause nicotine craving, and that might trigger intense craving for alcohol.Depression is another possible explanation for these findings.Many alcohol-dependent patients are depressed.If their depression is exacerbated by nicotine abstinence or relative nicotine deprivation, perhaps patients will use alcohol to self-treat their depression.Shoptaw: When you work with people who have multiple substances of dependence, removing one doesn't necessarily affect the others.Or it may.We don't know.Joseph: Our study results have yet to be duplicated.In addition, in contrast to the ATC scenario described in this article, the nicotine treatment in our study was not compulsory.All in all, the question of how con-",

The origin of individual preferences and values is one of the remaining theoretical questions in social and behavioral sciences. The Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis suggests that more intelligent individuals may be more likely to acquire and espouse evolutionarily novel values than less intelligent individuals. Consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs is evolutionarily novel, so the Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis would predict that more intelligent individuals are more likely to consume these substances. Analyses of two large, nationally representative, and prospectively longitudinal data from the United Kingdom and the United States partly support the prediction. More intelligent children, both in the United Kingdom and the United States, are more likely to grow up to consume more alcohol. More intelligent American children are more likely to grow up to consume more tobacco, while more intelligent British children are more likely to grow up to consume more illegal drugs.",

      "abstract": "The psychedelic drugs have unusually wide-ranging effects that vary greatly depending on the setting and the user's personality and expectations. The fact remains that psychedelic drugs were used for more than fifteen years by hundreds of psychiatrists who considered them relatively safe therapeutic agents. Psychedelic therapy for alcoholism is based on the assumption that one overwhelming experience sometimes changes the self-destructive drinking habits of a lifetime, and the hope that psychedelic drugs can consistently produce such an experience. The purpose of giving psychedelic drugs to the dying might be stated as reconciliation: reconciliation with one's past, one's family, and one's human limitations. In the 1960s Walter Pahnke, a Doctor of Divinity as well as a psychiatrist, carried out an experiment designed to investigate the potential of psychedelic drugs to facilitate mystical experience. Illicit psychedelic drug use is an underground spring that continues to feed the stream of interest in systematic, publicly controlled experimentation.",

We live in a profound chemical culture and it is obvious that drug abuse is pervasive in our society. Moreover, drugs are very controversial and mean different things to different people. To further complicate matters, drug-related research is often inconclusive and frequently contradictory. It is thus not surprising that almost everyone in the field has his or her own set of beliefs about the phenomenon of drug abuse. These beliefs are usually firmly held and often highly biased. This article contains a listing and brief discussion of numerous interrelated psychosocial issues which appear to be necessary for a thorough drug education program. While admittedly biased, these topics appear to be among the main ones currently identified in the field. The issues addressed may provide fresh insights or stimulate fruitful discussion. Some may cause annoyance and be disputed—such is the nature of controversial topics.",

Une telle modalité de consommation d’alcool est communément rencontrée chez les jeunes. Elle entraîne des déficits cognitifs en impliquant probablement des processus neuroinflammatoires et épigénétiques. Toutefois, le mode d’action de l’alcool au cours des expositions initiales de type BD, est peu connu. Il pourrait pourtant être à l’origine de ces déficits cognitifs à long terme. Des études récentes, réalisées chez le rat adolescent, révèlent que la perte de mémoire se produit dès les premiers BD, avec des mécanismes similaires à ceux d’une exposition plus longue. L’initiation au BD chez le jeune serait donc responsable de déficits qui seront probablement entretenus par la répétition de cette pratique. Ces données originales devraient permettre de renforcer les campagnes de prévention auprès de la jeune population qui pratique le BD.",

Due to the relatively recent rise in popularity, within the general public, not as much is known about the beverage compared to other beverages that have been on the market longer such as beer. This is important and relevant to public health because, due to the nature of the production method used to create Kombucha, the drink itself may contain alcohol. While at the time of production and distribution, the levels of alcohol are below the regulated maximum of 1%, these levels may increase on their own if measures were not put in place to stop the beverage from self-fermenting post-distribution. Kombucha is sold as a non-alcoholic beverage as they aren’t required to be defined as liquor (because it is &lt;1% ethanol), when in reality, they may contain more than 1% ethanol due to the self-fermentation process. This poses as a potential health risks to people who do not consume alcohol for personal reasons or to adolescents who should not be consuming alcohol.",

Many of the strategies such as increasing taxes, increasing control over promotion of tobacco, and the restriction of smoking should be made a priority. However, there is still the need to provide help for the smoker to quit. The evidence with regards to effective ways of getting smokers to quit and the effectiveness of different modalities is reviewed. Programs found to be effective include self-help, individual counseling, and group counseling. Counseling programs appear to double the effect of success compared to no program. Nicotine replacement therapy has been demonstrated to be an important adjunct therapy to the behavioral programs. Issues regarding the cessation of tobacco by youth need to be addressed distinctively from adult cessation. Relapse prevention for both youth and adults needs to become a major focus of programs dealing with smokers who want to quit.",

      "abstract": "Nesbitt's Paradox states that cigarette smoking generates physiological and psychological changes which are normally incompatible, namely increased arousal together with decreased stress. This review confirms these changes, but shows that they are dependent upon various factors, particularly the degree of nicotine deprivation. Thus the relaxant properties of smoking reflect the relief of irritability which develops between cigarettes. The deleterious mood effects of abstinence explain why smokers suffer more daily stress than non-smokers, and become less stressed when they quit smoking. Deprivation reversal also explains much of the arousal data, with deprived smokers being less vigilant and less alert than non-deprived smokers or non-smokers. Nicotine can, however, display genuine stimulant properties, although due to repeated abstinence effects the average arousal level of smokers is generally similar to non-smokers. Mood normalization also explains why nicotine is so addictive, with regular smokers needing nicotine just to \"function\" normally. Finally, Nesbitt's Paradox also assumes that arousal and emotionality are associated with each other. Yet factor analysis of mood and personality questionnaires shows that these two dimensions are statistically independent, with the stress and arousal changes during smoking also generally uncorrelated. Nesbitt's Paradox is therefore not actually a paradox; it never was a paradox.",

This review suggests that blood glucose is one important part of the energy source of self-control. Acts of self-control deplete relatively large amounts of glucose. Self-control failures are more likely when glucose is low or cannot be mobilized effectively to the brain (i.e., when insulin is low or insensitive). Restoring glucose to a sufficient level typically improves self-control. Numerous self-control behaviors fit this pattern, including controlling attention, regulating emotions, quitting smoking, coping with stress, resisting impulsivity, and refraining from criminal and aggressive behavior. Alcohol reduces glucose throughout the brain and body and likewise impairs many forms of self-control. Furthermore, self-control failure is most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose. Self-control benefits numerous social and interpersonal processes. Glucose might therefore be related to a broad range of social behavior.",

Pendant longtemps, l'action medicale a ce sujet etait centree sur le produit consomme, faite de mises en garde ou d'interdits le concernant.

Deuxieme consequence : d'autres comportements ont egalement des potentialites addictives ; il est vite apparu que le concept d'addiction allait bien au-dela des comportements de consommation de « drogues », et pouvait concerner la consommation de medicaments psychotropes, certains comportements alimentaires ou d'activite physique, le dopage, les jeux de hasard...

      "abstract": "El “paco” es la denominacion vulgar de “pasta base de cocaina”, y su nombre toma la primera silaba de pasta y la primera de cocaina. Es una droga de bajo costo elaborada a partir de residuos de cocaina (cocaina sin elaborar). Diversos estudios indican la peligrosidad de la adiccion al paco que lleva a quien se drogan con esta modalidad, a actuaciones transgresoras,a prostituirse o a robar o a matar,para conseguir dinero con el proposito de comprar paco nuevamente cuando los efectos del consumo disminuyen o desaparecen. El objetivo que se plantea en esta investigacion es estudiar la relacion que existiria entre este tipo de adiccion al “paco y la transgresion a la ley penal en adolescentes, entre 15 y 18 anos, respecto de los efectos de dicha practica adictiva en su estado afectivo y su relacion con la transgresion a la ley penal, y establecer semejanzas y diferencias con adolescentes adictos a la cocaina con otra modalidad de consumo.\r\nPalabras Clave\r\nAdiccion, transgresion, adolescencia.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nADDICTION TO “PACO”AND THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW BETWEEN ADOLESCENTS “Paco” is the vulgar term for “coca paste” and its name is formed (taken from) by the first syllable of each word. It is alow-cost drug made from cocaine waste (unprocessed cocaine) Studies show the dangers of addiction to paco leading consumers (to who drugs with this method) to transgressive actions, prostitution, stealing or murder, in order to get money to purchase more paco when the effects are reduced or disappear. The objective (purpose, goal, aim, target) of this research is to study the relations between this type of addiction to “paco” and the transgression of the criminal law between adolescents, between 15 and 18, regarding the effect so faddictive practice that affect state and its relation to the offense criminal law and to establish similarities and differences with teenagers cocaine addicts with another form of consumption.\r\nKey Words\r\nAddiction, transgression, adolescence.",

      "abstract": "The use of mind-altering drugs other than alcohol presents a serious contemporary problem. Some people are concerned about the real effects of drugs on users, others about perceived effects which at times seem to bear little relationship to pharmacologic reality. Many are aroused primarily because they see in drug use a symptom of widespread moral and religious decay. A few are worried largely because they fear that drug users may commit acts which harm innocent nonusers. All of these concerns are important in considering the role of mindaltering drugs in the occurrence of highway crashes, because these concerns have largely determined our perception of the problem of drugs and highway crashes. At times, they have led to preventive and corrective actions that not only are inappropriate but often sap away scarce funds and effort that should be devoted to more effective solutions.

      "title": "Non Smoking for Successful Aging: Therapeutic Perspectives",
      "abstract": "The smoke of cigarettes represents an important accelerator of the aging process, and there is no doubt that smoke is an important risk factor for many diseases, in particular for cardiovascular, neoplastic and respiratory diseases. Smoking plays an important role also in the development of other pathological conditions being particularly frequent in geriatric ages, such as dementia, osteoporosis, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, senile macular degeneration, nuclear cataract and alterations of skin. This means that smoke compromises not only life expectancy, but also the quality of the life, favoring the occurrence of non-autonomy. Non-smokers have a much higher life expectancy than smokers, and the suspension of smoking is accompanied, even in the elderly, by an increase in the survival time due to the reduction of smoke-induced biological damage. The first requirement of stopping smoking certainly is the motivation of the smoker himself to do this, since without this motivation any attempt is futile. Today numerous quitting strategies exist, either of pharmacological or non-pharmacological type, which are also advantageous for the elderly person. Approved pharmacological treatments include nicotine replacement therapies, bupropion, drugs targeting cannabinoid receptors and newer pharmacological approaches including the selective nicotinic partial agonists. Varenicline, an alpha4 beta2 nicotinic acetylcoline receptor partial agonist, is the most recently agent approved for smoking cessation. This drug works by reducing the strength of the smokers urge to smoke and by relieving withdrawal symptoms. The most effective smoking cessation programs involve a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioural and/or cognitive counselling to improve abstinence rates.

When the human body is exposed to these carcinogens for a long time, the carcinogens will cause \"mutations\" in the genes in the body and gradually accumulate, causing the cells to be unable to \"function\" normally, eventually leading to the occurrence of malignant tumors.Harmful substances such as nicotine in tobacco can activate cytokines and intermediate products of fiber formation, which accelerate the process of liver fibrosis and hinder the recovery of liver function in patients with liver disease. The condition will worsen with the increase in daily smoking, promoting the occurrence of liver cancer.",

Während die zentralen Themen früher praktisch ausschließlich in der Diskussion um die negativen Auswirkungen der Prohibition und der Forderung nach Entkriminalisierung bestanden, bestimmt heute mehrheitlich eine differenziertere Auseinandersetzung um Modelle nationaler Markregulierung nach dem Vorbild des Verbraucherschutzes legaler Substanzen wie Alkohol und Tabak die Debatte. Es wird argumentiert, dass internationale Konventionen nationale gesetzliche Maßnahmen im Umgang mit Cannabis ver- oder zumindest behindert haben und dass eine effektive Kontrolle eine Anpassung nationaler Gesetze an die unterschiedlichen Risiken der jeweiligen Substanzen erforderlich macht.",

      "title": "The Negative Impact of Food Neophobia on the People of Chandigarh Tri-City, India",
      "abstract": "Food neophobia (FN) is the person’s fear to try eating new or unfamiliar foods. Food neophobia is directly attached with low quality of diet in adults; thus, the understanding of the relationship between FN and food consumption in more depth appears to be a key issue [1]. There are various factors that influence this eating behaviour of a person such as fear, taste, unwillingness, bad experience and lack of knowledge etc. The level of food neophobia generally decreases with late childhood to adult and increases with adult to old age.\r\nThrough the demographical influences or the inherited properties of the individual food neophobia can be displaced.  At some point of time in our life we all have said no to some particular food item because of our liking or disliking. Sometimes we do not eat some food due to the fear of trying a new food. A bad experience with a particular food may become the reason with some people not trying new food; similarly, lack of knowledge about different foods has been a factor that many people avoid trying a new food. There may be many other reasons for people to avoid or not trying new food. These eating behaviours of people leave them from getting proper nutrition that they need. Because they have restricted them to limited types of food, they may not be eating enough vitamins or nutrients. It’s been observed that neophobia can not only lead to malnutrition, but it also refrain the individual from social abilities. Food neophobia also restricts the individual from taking the healthier alternative of the food and also restricts in trying the new or traditional food items [2] [3].\r\nThe aim of the study was to access the relationship between food neophobia with demographic factors, and education in adults living in urban versus rural areas. This research has been conducted in the Tri-city, Punjab India. Primary data was collected from urban, suburban and rural areas through Google forms, print questionnaires and personal interviews. The questionnaire used in the study indicates the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS), the gender based choices, questions regarding food choice based on demographic factors like gender, age and income, questions on eating behavior and the different eating habits in relation to urban and rural. Data were collected via questionnaire. Total 600 people of age groups (30-45 years & 46 – 60 years) among diversified population of tri-city, Chandigarh, Panchkula & Mohali were given the questionnaires to fill-up.  441 useful responses were received which includes 246 responses from females and 195 responses from males.\r\nThe questionnaire was designed in such manner that it captures data regarding age and gender under demography, and education among people residing in rural as well as urban areas of the tri-city.\r\nThis research will give a insight about the malnutrition due to food neophobia specially in females, we found that geographical location plays an important role and the type of food preferred by urban and rural and the outcomes due to eating habits. This study will give an insight about the eating habits in relation to income and expenditure. We found that food neophobia strongly influence the variables selected for the study. Overall, the results suggest that food neophobia is an important barrier to dietary change and addressing diet-related health problems.  Actions focusing on alternate food choices may help to reduce the neophobia in adults thus increase the chances of maintaining the nutritious diet. Certain theoretical and practical implications in relation to food consumption and food neophobia are offered. Further research is recommended to confirm the observed relationships under different socio-cultural conditions.",

      "abstract": "The urge to drink, also often referred to as craving, is an emotional state in which a person is motivated to seek and use alcohol. In abstinent alcoholics, this urge may contribute to the risk of relapse. Researchers have developed several models--including the conditioned withdrawal model, conditioned appetitive motivational model, social learning model, and information-processing model--to describe the role of urges in relapse. Several studies have evaluated the role of urges in predicting alcoholism treatment outcome and relapse. Some findings indicate that the degree of urge an alcoholic experiences when confronted with a simulated high-risk situation at the end of alcoholism treatment can predict subsequent drinking. Other studies, however, show inconsistent results regarding the role of urges in predicting treatment outcome. Overall, the study results suggest that urges do not necessarily increase the risk of relapse but may actually protect some drinkers against further drinking.",

      "title": "Shame as a Public Health Intervention",
      "abstract": "The bioethicist Daniel Callahan has recently argued for ‘stigmatisation lite’ as a way to reduce the incidence of obesity. ‘The force of being shamed and beat upon socially’ worked for him when he stopped smoking, and a positive application of social pressure has been influential in behaviour change related to, for example, the reduction of drink driving, so why can’t we shame people into losing weight? Criticism of the paper was swift and multifaceted, but it turned out that he didn’t intend to stigmatise the obese at all – only to use social pressure (if that is possible) on the not-yet-obese or just a little overweight. Nevertheless his paper provides an opportunity to re-evaluate the use of stigma and shame as interventions in public health policy.\r\nPublic health policy is an enterprise which outwardly promotes personal choice, but encouraging and facilitating decision making based on capitulating to social conformity seems at odds with respecting personal autonomy. Health professionals spend a good deal of time and energy trying to increase self-esteem in stigmatised groups, and so a suggestion that we deliberately increase stigma, lite or otherwise, seems odd. Public health policy which aimed to increase stigma might be acceptable if it worked, but Callahan offered no evidence that it would.\r\nBut the rejection of stigma and shame as public health tools to reduce obesity does not necessarily reject the use of social emotions in public health policy. Differences between guilt and shame are discussed and I argue that in some circumstances fostering guilt for direct harms to others may be ethically acceptable. Television anti-smoking campaigns are used as examples it is tentatively concluded that Callahan’s ill-received paper promoting obesity shame should not obscure the possibility of using social emotions in public health policy elsewhere.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a real challenge in current age. “Addiction is defined as addicted to something, when it comes to drug addiction, it says it’s a complex disorder in brain. Now, and again, which is non congenital and a chronic illness. When we analyzed in details we found that the addiction has multifaced impact and it is spread all over the globe. But to get a perfect and effective way to resolve the concern, it is important that more researchers get involved in finding the solutions. Even clinical trials are also suggested in some critical conditions. But for this paper, we will stick to the data published in press information bureau. Where we found that the very large population are addicted. This addiction can be of any forms or types, below are some of them. 1. Alcohol 2. Cannabis 3. Opioids 4. Sedatives 5. Inhalants 6. Cocaine 7. ATS 8. Hallucinogens This analysis will give you the glimpse of current situation on addiction, which is really terrifying and a real challenge to tackle for the betterment of the family, society and actually for the country.",

In the past years, the pharmacological and behavioural effects of alcohol, such us sedation, memory and learning impairment, were assigned to the main component of alcoholic drinks, ethanol. Recently acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol, seems to exert biological activity, besides its adverse effects. The aim of the present review is to elucidate the putative role of acetaldehyde in mediating the neuronal and behavioural features induced by ethanol intake.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that light to moderate amounts of polyphenol-rich alcoholic beverages like wine or beer could have health benefits. Scientists have long debated the effects of alcohol on immune function, showing on the one hand, that high doses of alcohol consumption can directly suppress a wide range of immune responses, and that alcohol abuse is associated with an increased incidence of a number of infectious diseases. On the other hand, moderate alcohol consumption seems to have a beneficial impact on the immune system compared to alcohol abuse or abstinence. Therefore, the link between alcohol consumption, immune response, as well as infectious and inflammatory processes remains not completely understood. With this in mind, it is important to realise that other factors, unrelated or indirectly related to immune function, like drinking patterns, beverage type, amount of alcohol, or gender differences, will affect the influence that alcohol consumption may have on the immune system. This review summarises published data describing the effects that light to moderate amounts of polyphenol-rich beverages like wine or beer seem to have on immunity in healthy adults.",

      "title": "Determinantes de las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva, dependencia a la nicotina y estadios del cambio en fumadores",
      "abstract": "Antecedentes La adiccion a los cigarrillos se debe principalmente a la nicotina que contienen, pero poco se conoce sobre su dosificacion en fumadores. La medicion de la cotinina, el principal metabolito de la nicotina, ayuda a caracterizar la dosis de nicotina recibida por los fumadores, reflejando diferencias en la conducta tabaquica y en la motivacion para dejar de fumar, en el tipo de cigarrillos fumados y en el metabolismo de la nicotina en diferentes poblaciones. Hipotesis 1. El numero de cigarrillos fumados sera el principal determinante de las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva: las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva se incrementaran al incrementar el consumo de cigarrillos. 2. Las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva seran mayores cuanto menor tiempo haya transcurrido desde que el fumador se despierta hasta que fuma el primer cigarrillo. 3. Los fumadores mas dependientes tendran concentraciones de cotinina en saliva mas altas que los fumadores menos dependientes. 4. Los fumadores muy dependientes y con altas concentraciones de cotinina en saliva estaran menos preparados para dejar de fumar. Objetivos 1. Caracterizar la distribucion de las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva en fumadores y los factores que la influencian. 2. Estudiar la asociacion entre el tiempo transcurrido hasta el primer cigarrillo fumado despues de despertarse y la concentracion de cotinina en saliva. 3. Analizar la relacion entre la dependencia a la nicotina y las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva. 4. Estudiar la preparacion para dejar de fumar (estadios del cambio de Prochaska y DiClemente) de acuerdo al perfil de dependencia y los niveles de cotinina en saliva. Metodologia Los datos provienen de dos estudios independientes. Uno de ellos es un estudio transversal (2004-2005) de una muestra representativa de la poblacion general de Barcelona (n=1245), en el que se utilizo un cuestionario sobre tabaquismo y exposicion pasiva al humo del tabaco, asi como una muestra de saliva para determinar la concentracion de cotinina. El otro tambien es un estudio transversal (2006) de una muestra representativa de la poblacion espanola ?l8 anos (n=2522), en el que se utilizo una entrevista telefonica sobre consumo de tabaco y exposicion al humo ambiental del tabaco. Se calcularon medias y desviaciones estandar o medianas y rangos intercuartilicos, segun fuera apropiado, para describir los datos. Se utilizaron analisis descriptivos y modelos de regresion multiple en funcion de los objetivos propuestos. Resultados Las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva aumentaron a mayor consumo de cigarrillos hasta llegar aproximadamente a los 20 cigarrillos, nivel donde las concentraciones de cotinina se estabilizaban. El consumo diario de cigarrillos, el momento del dia en que se fuma mas y el tiempo transcurrido desde que el fumador se despierta hasta que fuma su primer cigarrillo estuvieron significativamente relacionados con la concentracion de cotinina en saliva. Este ultimo en particular demostro ser un buen indicador de dependencia. Por otra parte, no se observo una asociacion entre las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva y los estadios del cambio, si bien en cada estadio se observo que las concentraciones de cotinina aumentaban a mayor consumo de cigarrillos, a mayor nivel de dependencia y a menor tiempo transcurrido hasta fumar el primer cigarrillo del dia. Conclusiones Las concentraciones de cotinina en saliva estan relacionadas con el consumo diario de cigarrillos, el tiempo transcurrido hasta fumar el primer cigarrillo del dia y el nivel de dependencia a la nicotina, no asi con los estadios del cambio en los que se encuentran los fumadores. El consumo diario de cigarrillos, el tiempo hasta fumar el primer cigarrillo y el momento del dia en que se fuma mas son buenos indicadores del nivel de dependencia del fumador.",

      "abstract": "Smoking is one of the most preventable causes of mortality and morbidity among Canadians, yet the use of tobacco remains an important and challenging public health issue., The current Canadian youth are one of the first generations that are more likely to be aware than not of the health risks associated with traditional tobacco consumption (e.g., cigarettes, chewing tobacco). Even though the prevalence of traditional tobacco consumption by youth may be lower than previous generations,, there are added concerns with the most recent invention of vaping devices and e-cigarettes. Vaping is recognized to be associated with significant adverse events with short-term use and the long-term implications of such a novel technology are unknown., Taken together, preventing tobacco or nicotine consumption, in any form, among youth is critical.Pharmacological therapy, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline, are effective in helping the general population of smokers quit using tobacco. Non-pharmacological therapies may also be useful in assisting patients who are ready to quit smoking. Examples of non-pharmacological therapies include behavioural therapy, physician advice, telephone-based interventions, and group/peer or individual smoking cessation programs delivered in person or remotely. In certain populations, such as pregnant women, non-pharmacological therapy, specifically cognitive behavioural therapy, can be as effective as NRT. In addition, pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies can be used alone or as a combined therapy. Overall, there is less evidence regarding which interventions are most effective for youth (defined by the United Nations as 15 to 24 years).,To inform policy decisions about using pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation among youth, specific evidence is required. As such, this report aims to review the clinical effectiveness of using a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological smoking cessation interventions or non-pharmacological smoking cessation interventions alone for youth. The current report also aims to review evidence-based guidelines regarding smoking cessation interventions for youth.",

      "title": "Quick nic: novel smokeless nicotine products and pediatric trends",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review The development and marketing of smokeless nicotine products in recent years have become increasingly popular among adolescents. In addition to well known conventional inhaled nicotine products, noninhaled products, such as nicotine toothpicks, orbs, lozenges, strips, and more, have dangerously captivated a new youth audience. Although smokeless nicotine products may seem to be less threatening than conventional inhaled nicotine products, there are significant risks associated with the use of these products, including addiction and severe health issues. The purpose of this review is to provide up-to-date information about alternative nicotine products currently on the market that may appeal to youth, and the dangers of nicotine use for pediatric populations. Recent findings Smokeless nicotine products appeal to minors with their varying flavors and discrete packaging. These products may lead to nicotine toxicity as well as severe health problems, such as cancer, issues with reproduction, and heart attacks. Nicotine is extremely dangerous for young children; in fact, using nicotine products before the age of 18 years can lead to addiction and is linked to an increased likelihood of experimenting with stronger nicotine products or illicit drugs. The development of inconspicuous nicotine packaging has led to increasing concerns for accidental nicotine exposure and overdose in youth. Summary Greater knowledge regarding current nicotine products on the market, specifically smokeless nicotine products, will help clinicians be more aware of the dangers associated with these products. Clinicians will be better able to provide their patients and families with proper guidance to avoid nicotine addiction, further drug use, and detrimental health issues. Caregivers and medical professionals must recognize novel and inconspicuous nicotine products commonly used among youth, understand the signs of nicotine abuse and dependence, and take measures to address possible nicotine-related health risks.",

En utilisant un modèle à effets fixes et des données de panel provenant de la cohorte Gazel, les résultats montrent que le choc de santé a un impact significatif sur ces comportements de santé.

Ces résultats sont à mettre en exergue avec ceux des tentatives d’arrêt ou de diminution de la consommation de tabac qui durent, en moyenne, 2,4 mois.

      "abstract": "The causal link between smoking and increased morbidity and mortality is firmly established: almost 6 million people globally die each year as a result of smoking and half of these die in middle age or before [1]. Most people continue to smoke because they are tobacco dependent. This dependence is the result of the effect of repeated nicotine delivery to the brain, which is coupled with smoking behavior and the sensations and cues that are associated with it. Within a relatively short time a 'drive' or 'hunger' is created that only smoking can satisfy. Periods of abstinence produce urges to smoke, or cravings for a cigarette, as well as a number of other symptoms that can make it difficult to maintain abstinence. These symptoms typically peak within the first 2 weeks of stopping smoking and dissipate over time [2]. In addition, one of the main reasons people smoke so frequently throughout the day is believed to be to stave off withdrawal symptoms before they manifest.",

While the decision to quit does not appear to be directly influenced by price, we find that the younger an individual is when they start using cannabis the less likely they are to quit. Therefore, low cannabis prices lead to early use and because of that they lead to a low quit rate and hence a longer duration of use.",

      "abstract": "Chili pepper and its major active compound capsaicin have long been used not only a daily food additive but also medication worldwide. Like in other human organs and systems, capsaicin has multiple actions in gastrointestinal (GI) physiology and pathology. Numerous studies have revealed that capsaicin acts on GI tract in TRPV1-dependent and –independent manners, mostly depending on its consumption concentrations. In this review, we will focus on the beneficial role of capsaicin in GI tract, a less highlighted aspect, in particular how dietary capsaicin affects GI health, the mechanisms of actions and its preventive/therapeutic potentials to several GI diseases. Dietary capsaicin affects GI tract not only via TRPV1-derpendent and independent manners, but also via acute and chronic effects. Although high dose intake of dietary capsaicin is harmful to human health sometimes, current literatures suggest that appropriate dose intake is likely beneficial to GI health and is preventive/therapeutic to GI disease in most cases as well. With extensive and intensive studies on its GI actions, capsaicin, as a daily consumed food additive, has potential to become a safe drug for the treatment of several GI diseases.",

Alcohol is having varying impact on health of people. Short-term effects include motor vehicle accidents, violence, injuries, and risky sexual behavior while long-term effects include carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, gastric ulcer, pancreatitis etc (2). Alcohol consumption is a major Public health Challenge. In India 18.8% males and 1.3% females above age of 15 years were consuming alcohol according to NFHS-5 Survey (3). In India different states are having different age limits for alcohol purchase and consumption. Although legal age for alcohol consumption in India varies from 18-25 years of age. States like Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland and union territory of Lakshadweep and Manipur has complete ban on sale &amp; purchase of same (4). Although some rules and regulations are there but still many people who are below this age limit they consume it. Alcohol is also one of the habit-forming substances so when control is not there people land up in chronic alcoholism. Reasons for increase in consumption of alcohol is rapid industrialization, nuclear family, staying away from warm family environment, peer pressure, pressure of job and performing well in life, i.e. target setting is there, increase social gatherings and alcohol consumption is considered as symbol of modernization.",

For India, this problem has been a unique one, with the consumption patterns either largely influenced by the socioeconomic backgrounds or dictated by the cultural diversity. With more than 200 million tobacco consumers in the country at present, it becomes imperative to address this health hazard and stir up strong measures toward damage control. This article addresses the tobacco problem, its evolution, and the factors that have affected the growth of Indian tobacco industry. It also highlights the current legislative measures against tobacco, fiscal gains to the government, and the serious health and economic impact to the consumer, compounded by the increasing cost of private health care in the present era of consumerism.",

En la actualidad, su consumo es un problema de salud publica, especialmente en la zona de Los Andes. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha, no se han estudiado los factores asociados al inicio de este habito. Por ello, se realizo un estudio cualitativo para describir los factores que motivan al inicio del consumo de chimo en un grupo de pacientes que acuden a consulta en la Facultad de Odontologia de la Universidad de Los Andes. Los resultados de esta investigacion, mostraron que los pacientes se iniciaron en el consumo de esta sustancia, motivados por familiares, amigos y companeros de trabajo. Al ser esta una practica comun en su entorno de vida cotidiana, su consumo y uso se percibe como normal, especialmente para las multiples aplicaciones clinicas. Por lo general tiene un significado que transciende el habito sin sentido. Reproduce, de alguna manera, las practicas socioculturales de los ancestros. Se sugiere explorar los factores asociados al consumo de chimo en consumidores que interactuen predominantemente en zonas urbanas.",

Although it is not approved for human use in many regions, it continues to be used in bodybuilding and athletics for physique and performance enhancement. Its appeal lies in its ability to influence muscle development and fat metabolism. Many individuals use it due to psychological motivators such as body image concerns and a desire for rapid physical changes. However, its use may result in side effects involving the heart, muscles, and overall physical well-being, such as arrhythmias, hypertension, and muscle spasms. In some cases, it has also been linked to accidental exposure through contaminated food. The widespread misuse of clenbuterol raises ethical concerns in competitive environments. More discussion is needed around developing safer methods of achieving similar goals, and there is a need for increased public awareness and caution regarding its use.",

The alkaloid nicotine present in the plant leafs is a stimulant and has an addictive effect. The tobacco plants have been historically grown and used for recreational purposes by the American local population. The dried tobacco leaves are consumed as chewing tobacco, snuff, and smoked in a variety of dispensations. Tobacco use (TU) has an adverse effect on various body systems and is a determinant for different diseases ranging from cancers to atherosclerosis. TU is a modifiable environmental risk factor for various diseases. Hence, with public health education and behavior modification, its burden can be reduced in a given society. Thus, the understanding of the incidence and prevalence of its use is necessary. This review attempts to sum up the significance and determinants of TU.",

The subsequent social changes which led to greater integration of the area with the rest of the country may have contributed to a decline in the practice. In recent years poppy tea drinking has been revived within the illicit drug using community and a survey using a self‐report questionnaire was carried out among patients attending the Cambridge Drug Dependency Unit. Forty‐three patients admitted to drinking poppy tea, usually during the summer months and on an intermittent basis. The potency of the infusion varied and was unpredictable but in general was low. Although poisoning from herbicides and pesticides was seen as the main risk, it is in the main perceived by drug users as a harmless secondary activity existing alongside the more regular and more potent drugs of misuse.",

      "abstract": "Ecstasy/MDMA is usually lumped with “club drugs” which is where ecstasy is more likely to be prevalent since it comes in hand with EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and other club music and is advertised as “Molly” to be a pure form of ecstasy which is very hard to know if it contains any MDMA at all. According to a study conducted by Johnston et al., the individual’s perceived risk and harmfulness of the drug determine usage. Risk was observed during a period of time and it can be alarming when perceived risk drops because it can have unpredictable effects on new population using ecstasy/MDMA. One of the highest predictors found if a young adult would participate in the use of ecstasy is the association with other ecstasy users and the types of events attended.\r\nPopularity of ecstasy/MDMA does not have a consistent measure of popularity since it is often changing and each risk perceived is effective to drops in popularity as well as when the risk is not seen as a big issue. During a longitudinal study Johnston et al. was able to see that while one year of high school students could have negative perceptions of a drug others could be exempt and would affect just those years of students.\r\nOne popular predictor found by Smirnov et al. was that much ecstasy use occurred under a specific type of music culture which was mainly electronic music and dance music in clubs as opposed to a diminished amount in places where there was live music. This shows that the social environment has a deep influence on the frequency that the drug is offered on individuals. This is because the basic perception of the drug is associated to be part of the electronic music scene.",

The study found that the death causes of kings were lifestyle habits that harm their health such as geriatric diseases, complications and various illnesses to shorten longevity which result from oily foods, sensual pleasures and the reduction of the resistance by lack of exercise. Most of the Joseon kings suffered from both a lot of work and strengthening their governing power, and it brought them a plenty of mental stresses with lack of exercise. These mental fatigues increased appetite for greasy food to cause disease, and then too much sexual solicitation of concubines was followed with fullness. Thus all the stresses could end up with overeating and too much intercourse to death.",

This is supported by an expanding body of evidence from animal studies, human neuroscience, and brain imaging. Obese and overweight individuals also display patterns of eating behavior that resemble the ways in which addicted individuals consume drugs. Scientific and clinical questions remain: Is addiction a valid explanation of excess weight? Is food addiction a behavioural (i.e., eating) or substance (i.e., sugar) addiction, or a complex interaction of both? Should obesity be treated as a food addiction? Should we distinguish food addiction from other forms of disordered eating like Binge Eating Disorder? It is also unclear what impact food addiction explanations might have on the way in which we think about or treat people who are overweight: What impact will a food addiction diagnosis have on individuals' internalised weight-bias, stigma, and self-efficacy? Should some foods be regulated like other addictive commodities (i.e., alcohol and tobacco), whose advertising and sale is restricted, or like certain foods, which are taxed? This Special Issue addresses questions raised by the concept of food addiction.",

It can range from just getting tired more easily than normal to a feeling of total exhaustion after not doing much. It can reduce your activities and take the edge off your pleasure in what you do manage. As this is probably one of the three or four symptoms that most reduces quality of life, it seems reasonable to start a discussion of managing specific problems with this one. Although we cannot suggest a ‘magic bullet’ of a drug that will eliminate fatigue, we can suggest ways of managing it. If you tire easily and have a very limited amount of energy, then it is very important to manage what energy you do have in the best way so that you are able to do more without becoming exhausted. There are various techniques that really do help.",

      "abstract": "L'OMS include dipendenza da tabacco nella lista dei disturbi legati all'uso di sostanze farmacologiche e come tale deve essere trattata. Quindi il fumo di sigaretta oltre ad essere un vizio e/o un'abitudine e una vera e propria dipendenza. Infatti, delle 4000 sostanze tossiche che contiene una sigaretta, troviamo nicotina che e quella sostanza che induce alla dipendenza. E' sostanza che fa si che il fumatore cerchi sempre un'altra sigaretta e non riesca a farne a meno. La medicina ufficiale solo nel 1988 ha affermato che nicotina dava dipendenza come altre droghe, quali l'eroina e cocaina: la nicotina e sostanza contenuta nel tabacco che porta alla dipendenza... l'uso del tabacco risponde ai criteri correntemente utilizzati per definire l'assuefazione. Ecco perche per molti fumatori e difficile smettere di fumare. In questa prospettiva le proprieta gratificanti della nicotina e delle altre sostanze psicoattive dopo somministrazione in acuto possono essere inquadrate nel costrutto teorico delle azioni di rinforzo positivo delle droghe, mentre le proprieta motivazionali dell’astinenza possono essere considerate alla stregua di rinforzi negativi alla sospensione delle droghe d’abuso. Da queste considerazioni nasce nel quartiere Scampia di Napoli “Il progetto sfuma”, fortemente voluto dal Ministero della Salute, il Ministero del Lavoro e della Previdenza Sociale, dalla Regione Campania e dal Comune di Napoli, come strumento utile per liberare risorse in questo campo per tutela della salute pubblica. Al momento sono stati selezionati 80 operatori che hanno partecipato ad un corso di formazione specifico (aula e stage) per poi essere inseriti nei centri antifumo coordinati da dirigenti sanitari.",

Signs of suicide could be the own home as the chosen location for heroin overdose and the presence of partners (\"moment of death companion\"). Interventions should include simple techniques such as first aid, naloxone administration, resuscitation, prevention of relapse of prisoners and social network extension involving maintenance programs.A droghasználatot önmagában is öndestrukciónak tekinthetjük, így közvetve kötődik a halállal kapcsolatos attitűdhöz, és jelentős számban fordul elő különböző, a narkotikumok által okozott suicidium a droghasználók körében. A tanulmány célja, hogy feltárja a drog–halál kapcsolat eredetét, hátterét, és azon belül a heroin okozta túladagolások okait a témával foglalkozó tanulmányok elemzésével, eredményeik összefoglalásával. A tiszta heroinos túladagolók életkora az évek folyamán fokozatosan nő. A rendőrségtől való félelem a túladagolás megelőzését és a mentők értesítését gátló tényező. Az öngyilkosság szándékosságára utaló jel lehet a saját otthon mint választott hely, vagy a társak jelenléte, ami a halál pillanatában biztosított társat jelentheti. (Azt, hogy nincsenek egyedül a túladagolás pillanatában.) Ezért a segítségnyújtás egyszerűbb technikáit kell bevezetni: elsősegélynyújtás, naloxonbeadás, újraélesztés, a börtönviseltek visszaesésének megelőzése, a szociális háló kiterjesztése, a fenntartó programokba való bevonás.

      "abstract": "Women with eating disorders sometimes smoke to control their weight. This study examined the relative contributions of the range of factors that motivate smoking in women with eating disorders. Twenty-five women with anorexia nervosa and 16 women with bulimia nervosa were compared with 21 women with a depressive mood disorder. Each completed measures of current and lifetime prevalence of smoking, motivation to smoke and dependence on smoking. Smoking was less prevalent in anorexia nervosa than in bulimia nervosa or in mood disorders. Although the eating-disordered women had a higher motivation to smoke for weight control than the mood-disordered group, overall motivation to smoke was higher in the eating-disordered women. Their strongest motivator for smoking was coping with stress. The eating-disordered women showed similar levels of dependence on smoking to the mood-disordered group, but tended to have a lower desire to give up smoking. Clinical interventions for women with eating disorders who smoke might be targeted at helping them cope with stress, as well as viewing their smoking as a method of weight control. Assessment of women with eating disorders should address the use of nicotine and motivations for its use, to help identify targets for intervention.

      "abstract": "Abstract Androgens, formerly known as anabolic‐androgenic steroids, mimic the effects of testosterone and are being increasingly abused for nonmedical purposes such as body and performance enhancement. Androgen abuse is associated with increased mortality, and multisystem adverse effects have been reported, including cardiovascular toxicity, infertility, hypogonadism, hepatotoxicity, and mental health disorders. Men may present with the negative health consequences of androgen abuse even despite cessation for a number of years. There is frequently a reluctance to disclose androgen abuse, and substances are often sourced from the black market, which is not regulated and where the products sold may be counterfeit. All men should be encouraged to stop androgen abuse. Managing associated adverse effects will be organ‐specific and is complex due to physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms, substance dependence, and high rates of relapse. Given the broad reach and prolonged adverse effects of androgen abuse, clinicians across medical specialties should have an awareness of androgen abuse, its increasing prevalence, and the harms it poses to men and their families. This narrative review aims to summarize the adverse effects and risks associated with androgen abuse.",

A growing body of both epidemiological and experimental evidences has reported the negative effects of incense use on human well-being, posing a potential threat at public significance. This work is a comprehensive review that covers the latest findings regarding the adverse impact of incense smoke on our health, providing a panoramic visualization ranging from mechanisms to implications. The toxicities of incense smoke come directly from its harmful constituents and deposition capacity in the body. Besides, reactive oxygen species-driven oxidative stress and associated inflammation seem to be plausible underlying mechanisms, eliciting various unfavorable responses. Although our current knowledge remains many gaps, this issue still has some important implications.",

However, severe reactions can develop, and a small proportion of these may be life-threatening. Before discussing specific drug eruptions, we should like to discuss the proof of a causal relationship between a given drug and an eruption. It is difficult to prove the precise etiologic agent for any suspected eruption. The only way to prove definitively that a given drug has caused an eruption is to discontinue the suspected drug, wait until the reaction clears, and then readminister the drug to observe if a relapse occurs. If the condition improves and ultimately clears entirely when the drug is withdrawn, and reappears when the drug subsequently is readministered, the drug may be regarded as the causal agent. However, readministering the suspected drug is very hazardous, and<i>we must emphasize</i>",

      "abstract": "A child will breath up to 3 times the volume per body weight compared to an adult. A child’s organs and immune system are not fully developed to offer protection from airborne and residual toxins compared to an adult. A child is unable to control their environment or escape their home environment, an adult can change jobs or leave a toxic environment. Thus, children are the most susceptible to the effects of toxins in their environment. Tobacco Smoke exposure is the greatest toxic exposure risk a child faces in a home environment. Tobacco Smoke exposure starts in the womb when the embryo embeds in the mother’s uterus and connects to their mother’s blood flow. Tobacco smoke contains many osteotoxic, nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic chemicals that significantly alter genetic material in the developing fetus and child, which has long-term health effects leading to poor bone health and skeletal diseases later in life. Three of the many thousands of toxins in tobacco smoke which are most osteotoxic, nephrotoxic, cytotoxic, and genotoxic are lead, cadmium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa often simply called anorexia is an eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of weight. People with anorexia place a high value on controlling their weight and shape, using extreme efforts that tend to significantly interfere with their lives. To prevent weight gain or to continue losing weight, people with anorexia usually severely restrict the amount of food they eat. They may control calorie intake by vomiting after eating or by misusing laxatives, diet aids, diuretics or enemas. They may also try to lose weight by exercising excessively. No matter how much weight is lost, the person continues to fear weight gain. Anorexia isn't really about food. It's an extremely unhealthy and sometimes life-threatening way to try to cope with emotional problems. When you have anorexia, you often equate thinness with self-worth. Anorexia, like other eating disorders, can take over your life and can be very difficult to overcome. But with treatment, you can gain a better sense of who you are, return to healthier eating habits and reverse some of anorexia's serious complications. The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. Bioactive phytochemicals in food supplements are a trending approach to facilitate dieting and to improve patients’ adherence to reducing food and caloric intake. The aim of this systematic review was to assess efficacy and safety of the most commonly used bioactive phytochemicals with appetite/hunger-suppressing and/or satiety/fullness-increasing properties. To be eligible, studies needed to have included at least 10 patients per group aged 18 years or older with no serious health problems except for overweight or obesity. Of those studies, 32 met the inclusion criteria, in which 27 different plants were tested alone or as a combination, regarding their efficacy in suppressing appetite/hunger and/or increasing satiety/fullness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction remains a popular yet controversial construct, which proposes that overeating and obesity arise from the consumption of “addictive” foods. This model rests on the assumption that foods, or their constituent macronutrients, elicit pharmacological effects on the brain analogous to those produced by addictive drugs. However, there has been no critical examination of whether the key pharmacological characteristics of addictive substances truly extend to food. In this chapter, we consider if two proposed addictive components of food, sugar and dietary fat, recapitulate the pharmacological properties of drugs, such as their impact on mesolimbic dopamine release. We find no convincing evidence to support the classification of sugar or dietary fats as addictive substances, particularly as addictive-like consumption in animals arises from orosensory effects alone. We caution against the implementation of food addiction as an explanation for disordered eating.",

Pagophagia (compulsive ice chewing) is a particular form of pica that is characterized by ingestion of ice, freezer frost, or iced drinks. It is usually associated with iron deficiency anemia or mental abnormalities like intellectual disabilities, autism, etc. Very few case reports have reported association of eating ice cubes with compulsive behavior or depressive disorders. In this case report, we present the association of pagophagia with sadness in a patient with recurrent depressive disorder. A 44-year-old female suffering from depressive disorder since the age of 33 years presented with symptoms of an intense desire to eat ice cubes that she was unable to resist and would feel better only after consumption of ice cubes or iced drinks. Initially she would consume about 250-500 g of ice cubes per day, but gradually the quantity of consumption of ice increased to about 10-12 kg of ice cubes per day. These symptoms were related to low mood and stress. The preoccupation with consumption of ice was associated with significant psychosocial dysfunction and interpersona problems with the spouse. She was managed with venlafaxine 187.5 mg/day and cognitive behavior psychotherapy (identifying her cognitive errors, generating alternative thoughts, problem solving, activity scheduling and mastery, and pleasure technique) with which her depressive symptoms improved and her pagophagia reduced significantly but did not subside completely. She learned to use alternative coping mechanisms to deal with her psychosocial stressors.",

      "abstract": "It has become obvious that `the war on drugs` has not dampened the use, abuse and trade of drugs; In fact, their use has increased. It is now long overdue to look into other reasons as to why drug use is so prevalent, especially in the modernized world, and how ancient knowledge of human being and spiritualized focus systems like yoga can contribute to our understanding of our tendency towards drug use. The marijuana, cocaine ecstasy, speed, alcohol, psychedelics, heroin and pharmaceuticals have effects on the body, mind and spirit according to the science of yoga. Yoga is an alternative, a positive way to generate a change in consciousness that instead of providing an escape empowers people with an ability to access a peaceful, restorative inner state that integrates mind, body and spirit. Yoga is a great way to slowly reintroduce someone to physical sensation. It is also very relaxing. So, in terms of anxiety, stress and depression that arise from intoxication, yoga is invaluable in helping people stay calm and grounded. It is increasingly being used in substance abuse treatment programs and through recovery to help prevent relapse, reduce withdrawal symptoms and drug cravings. It provides a healthy outlet to cope with potential triggers and daily life stressors. The yoga does not require expensive equipmentor a special location. It can be practiced anywhere at any time as needed. Coming from the Sanskrit word Yuj, which is interpreted to mean `union’, yoga is an ancient technique designed to bring mind and body closer together with the use of exercise, meditation and breathing. It has been traditionally recognized as a metaphysical and spiritual science leading to the union of individual consciousness and cosmic being with integration of body, mind and spirit. The psycho-somatic diseases and the therapy engulfing the modern world has already been dealt in detail through the psychotherapeutic concepts in the various yogic scripts right from the Vedic period up to the recent modern age. The ancient Vedicscripts vehemently discourage the usage of drugs for recreational purpose. Overuse of alcohol or any other intoxicant is condemned upon and there are lots of references that teach against using any such substance for intoxication. Desire leads to repeated sensual pleasure which leads to addiction. Addiction to alcohol can be overcome by diverting the mind to a spiritual path characterized by doing one`s duty coupled with yoga, meditation and relaxation techniques. The ancient Indian yogic texts strongly advocate the significance of de-addiction to alcoholism and drug abuse.

E-Cigarettes work by heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine, flavorings, and other chemicals. When the liquid is heated, users inhale an aerosol into their lungs. While e-cigarettes are generally considered less harmful than traditional tobacco products, they still contain potentially harmful chemicals, which can damage DNA and lead to cancer. Several studies have investigated the potential cancer risk associated with e-cigarette use, while other studies have suggested that e-cigarette aerosol may contain carcinogenic chemicals that could increase the risk of lung and bladder cancer in humans. However, these studies are limited in their scope and do not provide conclusive evidence. Overall, the long-term cancer risk associated with e-cigarette use remains uncertain, more research is needed to fully understand the potential risks and benefits of e-cigarettes.

      "abstract": "Women may have difficulty maintaining smoking cessation efforts due to negative affect and fear of weight gain. Dieting smokers who rely on cigarettes for affect regulation and weight management may be especially prone to weight gain and smoking relapse following initial smoking abstinence. The present study, which included 82 women smokers, assessed the relationship between dieting status, self-efficacy, and temptation to smoke and eat following a depressing or elating mood induction. Women with high levels of dietary restraint (i.e., more dieting behavior) had more confidence in their ability to refrain from smoking when in the elated mood condition, and they were more tempted to smoke when in the depressed condition. At low levels of dietary restraint (i.e., less dieting behavior), depressed or elated mood condition appeared to have little impact on women's confidence to refrain from smoking or their temptation to smoke. Dieting status seems to moderate the impact of positive and negative mood states, especially with respect to women's smoking behavior. These findings may have implications for dieters who are trying to quit smoking and also maintain their weight.",

Here, we report that behaviors that resemble three of the essential diagnostic criteria for addiction appear over time in rats trained to self-administer cocaine. As in humans, this addiction-like behavior is present only in a small proportion of subjects using cocaine and is highly predictive of relapse after withdrawal.

      "title": "PELATIHAN BAHAYA NARKOBA DAN KENAKALAN REMAJA TERHADAP MANAJEMEN KEUANGAN",
      "abstract": "Menurut UU No. 22 Tahun 1997, Narkotika adalah “zat atau obat yang berasal dari tanaman atau bukan tanaman baik sintesis maupun semi sintesis yang dapat menyebabkan penurunan atau perubahan kesadaran, hilangnya rasa, mengurangi sampai menghilangkan rasa nyeri, dan dapat menimbulkan ketergantungan”. Sebenarnya Narkoba adalah obat legal yang digunakan dalam dunia kedokteran, namun dewasa ini Narkoba banyak disalahgunakan. Bahkan di kalangan remaja tidak sedikit yang terjerumus dalam bahaya narkoba. Banyak dari mereka yang menggunakan Narkoba dengan alasan untuk Upaya pemberantasan Narkoba pun sudah sering dilakukan, namun masih sedikit kemungkinan untuk menghindarkan Narkoba dari kalangan remaja maupun dewasa. Hingga saat ini upaya yang paling efektif untuk mencegah pengaruh Narkoba pada remaja yaitu dari pendidikan, keluarga. Orangtua diharapkan mengawasi dan mendidik anaknya untuk selalu menjauhi narkoba. Dan hingga kini narkoba pun telah merajalela di kalangan para remaja. Hal tersebut akan mengganggu prestasi belajar siswa yang mengkonsumsi Narkoba tersebut. Jika para remaja khususnya usia sekolah mengkonsumsi Narkoba tanpa henti (ketagihan) akan merusak beberapa jaringan di tubuh pecandu yang mengakibatkan tidak konsentrasi dalam pelajaran, selalu gelisah, tidak fokus pada pelajaran sehingga prestasi siswa pecandu akan menurun. Jika banyak remaja yang banyak mengkonsumsi narkoba dan banyak pula remaja yang sekolah akan kehilangan prestasi belajarnya. Kenakalan remaja adalah pelampiasan masalah yang dihadapi oleh kalangan remaja yang tindakannya menyimpang. Menurut ahli sosiologi Kartono, Kenakalan Remaja atau dalam bahasa Inggris dikenal dengan istilah juvenile delinquency merupakan gejala patologis sosial pada remaja yang disebabkan oleh satu bentuk pengabaian sosial. Akibatnya mereka mengembangkan bentuk perilaku yang menyimpang. Sedangkan menurut Santrock “Kenakalan remaja merupakan kumpulan dari berbagai perilaku remaja yang tidak dapat diterima secara sosial hingga terjadi tindakan kriminal.” Dengan adanya kenakalan remaja maka akan berpengaruh terhadap keuangan pribadi seseorang. Kesuksesan financial seseorang ditentukan oleh perilaku keuangan inividu itu sendiri. Tentunya banyak faktor yang mempengaruhi perilaku manajemen keuangan. Dalam teori perilaku terencana berasumsi bahwa perilaku seseorang dipengaruhi oleh sikap dan norma lain yang dipengaruhi oleh faktor eksternal, contohnya pengalaman, tingkat literasi dan pengetahuan seseorang. Perilaku manajemen keuangan adalah “kemampuan seseorang dalam mengatur (perencanaan, penganggaran, pemeriksaan, pengelolaan, pengendalian, pencarian dan penyimpanan) dana keuangan sehari-hari. Munculnya perilaku financial management, merupakan dampak dari besarnya hasrat seseorang untuk memenuhi kebutuhan hidupnya sesuai dengan tingkat pendapatan yang diperoleh” (Al Kholilah &amp; Iramani, 2013). Dalam program kegiatan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat (PKM) kali ini sasarannya adalah para santriwan santriwati di yayasan Alkamilah dengan memberikan pengetahuan mengenai bahaya narkoba. Lembaga pendidikan diharapkan juga mampu mendidik mereka untuk menjadi generasi bebas narkoba dan kenakalan remaja khususnya para santri. Berdasarkan permasalahan yang dihadapi anggota Yayasan Alkamilah, Bojongsari, Depok, melalui kegiatan pengabdian kepada masyarakat (PKM) para dosen dan mahasiswa dari Universitas Pamulang mencoba membantu memberikan pelatihan-pelatihan yang dibutuhkan Yayasan Alkamilah untuk para anak didiknya. Diharapkan dengan pelatihan bahaya narkoba dan kenakalan remaja terhadap manajemen keuangan ini dapat membantu menambah ilmu pengetahuan, meningkatkan wawasan para santri di yayasan tersebut.

      "title": "Detoxification of Caffeine by Halotolerent Pseudomonas alcaligenes-N58",
      "abstract": "Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline xanthine alkaloid that acts as a stimulant drug. Caffeine is found in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some plants, where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants. It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the coffee plant and the leaves of the tea bush, as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut. Other sources include yerba mate, guarana berries, guayusa, and yaupon holly. In humans, acts as a central nervous system stimulant, temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but, unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is both legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks, enjoyed with great popularity. Caffeine is toxic at sufficiently high doses, Caffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called intoxication or colloquially the caffeine jitters. The symptoms of intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heartbeat, and psychomotor agitation. In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked. By considering this in the present study a bacterium halotolerant Pseudomonas alcaligenes N-58 is isolated from saline soils of Kolhapur District of Maharashtra. The isolate Pseudomonas alcaligenes N-58 was identified by 16srRNA analysis. Detoxification study indicated that the isolate degrades completely into non-toxic products at 37OC, 120 rpm agitation, within 48 hours of inoculation. The study indicated that the isolate Pseudomonas alcaligenes N-58 can be used in the detoxification of from the soft drinks and other caffeine-containing drinks.",

Alcohol forms part of our cultural culture and, in general, an excessive permissiveness to the consumption -even an abusive one- of alcoholic drinks is to be observed. But, at the same time, everything redolent of alcoholism is rejected. On the one hand, there is an endeavour to bestow a nutritive value, even to protecting one’s health, on beer and wine in particular, and on the other, a significant social rejection of abuse is to be seen although there are difficulties in defining what abuse signifies. False popular beliefs that give alcohol a stimulant, calorific and nutritive function and with the ability to provide strength and to increase sexual appetite still persist. Important publicity campaigns with more or less concealed economic interests assist in maintaining these ideas. Alcoholic beverages continue to preoccupy politicians and professionals more that the general public who feel it to be one instrument more in their lives, associated most of all with times of relaxation, fun, company or solitude.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking may interact with the metabolism of a number of drugs. This has been demonstrated clearly in pharmacokinetic studies in animals and man. However, tobacco smoking as a variant has been studied with relatively few clinically essential drugs and these studies do not always demonstrate a consistent effect of smoking. This review therefore not only records what data have emerged from pharmacokinetic or other studies, but it also attempts to determine whether such interactions have clinical significance. The main finding of this review is that, in the majority of examples, there is little evidence that there is a recognizable hazard from the interaction per se. The exceptions to this general conclusion are limited to four drugs: insulin, propoxyphene, propranolol, and theophylline preparations. With these drugs, there is some evidence of clinical importance of an interaction with tobacco smoking.",

He is willing to try stopping smoking again but wonders if it is too late for him to benefit from quitting and if he ever can quit. The patient’s smoking should be tackled as a standard part of treating his presenting problem, an asthma flare. Tobacco use should be attended to at all patient visits, but respiratory or cardiac symptoms provide a special opportunity. Specific symptoms that can be attributed to tobacco use, rather than risk of future disease, can motivate smokers to change behaviour.

      "title": "An Antidote for THC Overdose?",
      "abstract": "FigureFigureAre you tired of the partygoer who didn't know his THC limit and just took too big an edible and landed in your ED? Panic stricken and thinking he was going to die, only to take up a bed for hours and fall asleep until a friend picked him up? Now, thanks to the latest harebrained invention of a weed aficionado, say hello to HIBEGONE. (https://www.hibegone.com.) That's right, high-be-gone, the smartest name for an antidote since Digibind, brought to you by the makers of other brand names such as OG-Kush, Wedding Crashers, and Gorilla Glue (not made by the same people). Seriously, though, this new product aims to help those who have taken too much avoid the unintentional, nonlethal overdose that can land people in the ED. You have to hand it to the marijuana user community: They noticed a lack of treatment and devised their own. Proof of this is in increasing ED visits in Colorado and poison control calls in states with recreational laws in place. We have had more negative outcomes, but the seriousness of those visits and calls has still been relatively mild and often easily managed with good old-fashioned Ativan. (This is not to be confused with a discussion on Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, which is more akin to long-term subclinical overdose from THC.) Cannabis lore holds that individuals can employ some home remedies when too much THC causes panic and anxiety instead of the intended pleasant high, including, according to social media and the dark web, biting into a peppercorn, taking CBD, and waiting it out. We in the ED have access to Ativan, which is the mainstay for the typical overdose leading to anxiety. But most people don't have Ativan laying around. From this paucity of an antidote available to laypeople comes the people's solution to the THC OD, HIBEGONE, chemically known as THCV (tetrahydrocannabivarin). One article noted that THCV is a nonpsychoactive neutral CB1 antagonist/reverse agonist and may act as an agonist or antagonist at the CB2 receptor depending on dose. (J Cannabis Res. 2020;2[1]:6; https://bit.ly/3YVq0Q9.) THCV is thought to block the psychological effects of THC, but the process is unknown. It is also referred to as “diet weed” or “weederall” after an article reported on THCV decreasing fasting plasma glucose. (Diabetes Care. 2016;39:1777. https://bit.ly/45P4E9d.) Interestingly, most states won't allow it to be placed in a dispensary alongside the medications that would lead to its use because it is derived from hemp. The same law that allows it to be legal in all 50 states also makes it illegal to sell THCV in a dispensary in certain states. The last question I hope you are asking yourself is whether it works. I have no idea. THCV has been notoriously difficult to access. This makes it difficult to formulate an opinion on it from a clinical perspective, and the paucity of literature on it makes it difficult to decide on a scientific perspective, leaving us in the dark. I would love to hear from anyone who has seen a patient who has tried it as an antidote. Please send me your experiences at [email protected]. DR.

      "title": "Stimulants and Society",
      "abstract": "Accelerating our lives, one compound at a time by Tania Aftandilians At any point in time, our bodies can be pushed to speed up or slow down. Central Nervous System (CNS) stimulants accelerate our body while CNS depressants decelerate it. By examining some of the most famous members of the CNS stimulant family, such as caffeine, cocaine, methampheta- mines, and pharmaceuticals, one can better grasp how perva- sive stimulants are in our society. The use and study of stim- ulants have also fueled many debates, such as the dangers of caffeine during pregnancy or the administration of drugs for alertness in children. The world is moving faster today than it ever has before due to advances in technology, greater communication, and globalization. People are expected to do more in the same amount of time than they were just decades ago, and many are relying heavily on stimulants just to keep up. While small amounts of legal and appropriate stimulants are perfectly fine for most people, one must be careful not to overdo it because side effects, including dependency, can occur. These stimulating drugs that alter our state of being are extremely powerful, and they can do a lot of good as well as a lot of damage, depending on how they are used. Caffeine Since childhood, caffeine has been a pervasive part of most of our diets. It is found in many natural and processed foods such as chocolate and beverages (coffee, tea, and soda), as well as in pills such as No-Doze and Excedrin. Caffeine can influence almost all organ systems, but the drug predominantly targets the CNS and the cardiovascular sys- tem. At these sites, the chemical blocks receptors for adeno- sine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that aides in sleep and suppresses arousal. Caffeine also increases the effects of dopamine by blocking reuptake, which can make a person feel good. At mild doses, caffeine can be beneficial by caus- ing alertness without major side effects. This chemical may also have less understood benefits; for instance, it has been suggested that caffeine may help to prevent Alzheimer's dis- ease. Fortunately for all of the caffeine addicts out there, caf- feine is a relatively safe stimulant because it takes quite a large dose to produce negative effects. At these higher doses, this drug may cause vomiting, abdominal pain, agitation, and seizures. Consuming large amounts of caffeine on a regular basis can cause dependency and desensitization, meaning one's body may require increasing amounts of caffeine to produce the same effect. Toxicologists estimate caffeine's LD50 to be approximately 50 cups (or 50 caffeine pills) for a 60 kg person, meaning that this dose is lethal for fifty per- cent of the population (Erowid 2007). In the rare case that someone would consume this much caffeine, ventricular fib- rillation would occur, leading to death. While caffeine gen- erally does not lead to life-threatening addictions, many peo- ple cannot discontinue their use because of the potentially severe withdrawal symptoms. These may include: headache, fatigue, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depression, anxiety, flu-like symptoms, and motor and cog- nitive impairment. Moderate amounts of caffeine do not pose a threat to the average person, but pregnant women need to take caution. In a Kaiser study released in January 2008, 1,063 pregnant women were tested and those who consumed over 200 mg/day (two or more cups of regular coffee or five 12-ounce cans of caffeinated soda) were found to be twice as likely to miscarry as those who consumed no caffeine (Kaiser Permanente 2008). This study found that caffeine, and not other chemicals in coffee, was directly related to the height- ened miscarriage rate. Caffeine can be harmful because it crosses the placenta and reaches the fetus, which can have difficulty metabolizing the caffeine since its metabolic sys- tem is not fully developed. Adverse effects on fetal develop- ment may also be attributed to hindered cell development and decreased placental blood flow. Although a 100% cor- relation is not shown, Kaiser Permanente has great faith in the findings of this study and recommends avoiding or high- ly limiting caffeine intake during pregnancy. Many physi- cians have already been making this recommendation despite the lack of clear-cut evidence, simply to err on the side of caution. The main criticism of this particular study, as well as of many other similar studies, was that morning sickness may lead to confusing results in caffeine studies. This is because women with healthy pregnancies tend to have more morning sickness symptoms as a result of a proper hormonal balance, and the morning sickness often gives them an aversion to caffeine, leading them to consume less. Critics claim that women who appear to have lower rates of miscarriage con- sume less caffeine, when really they had healthier pregnan- cies to begin with (Grady 2008). Other confounders need to be taken into account, since miscarriages most commonly result from chromosomal abnormalities and infections, nei- ther of which can be attributed to caffeine.

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are popular devices designed to heat a liquid solution, often containing nicotine, that generates an inhaled aerosol, or vapor. e-Cigarettes have been marketed as healthier alternatives to traditional cigarettes. Thus, most adult users are current or former smokers who use e-cigarettes to reduce or quit cigarette smoking. Switching completely from cigarettes to e-cigarettes is associated with reduced toxicant exposure and reduced short-term respiratory symptoms; however, long-term health effects of e-cigarettes are unknown. Although a recent randomized trial suggests that e-cigarettes may promote smoking cessation, systematic reviews have had low certainty of evidence regarding cessation. e-Cigarettes pose several potential health risks, including exposure to heavy metals and toxicants, and nicotine poisoning. e-Cigarettes are also popular among youth, with rates of e-cigarette use surpassing those of cigarette use in this population. Youth e-cigarette use is associated with increased risk of subsequent cigarette and marijuana use. Screening for e-cigarette use in youth and adults, including pregnant women, in conjunction with screening for tobacco use, is advised. Education and interventions to prevent e-cigarette use should be provided to all youth. Youth should be counseled to stop using nicotine/tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Although the impact of e-cigarette use in pregnancy is unknown, nicotine is a teratogen; thus, pregnant women should be counseled to abstain from using all nicotine/tobacco products.",

      "abstract": "'Consonant' smokers know and accept the risks associated with tobacco consumption, and do not wish to change their smoking, whereas 'dissonant' smokers are tobacco consumers whose attitudes differ from their behaviour. Dissonant smokers have several options: to quit smoking (the optimal solution), reduce their smoking, switch products or brands, or do nothing. To date, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is the best-established medical aid to smoking cessation, but several important factors impact on NRT use. As smokers constitute a diverse group there is a need for various different formulations, some of which will suit certain smokers better than others. Smokers should be allowed to select their preferred products in order to increase compliance, and should also be permitted to combine various products if desired. Adequate dosage regimens should be stressed in order to avoid under-dosing, which is common with NRT. It is also essential that the medical system focuses increasingly on the diagnosis and treatment of those smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking. High nicotine dependence correlates with a high risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease; because these smokers cannot quit, cessation efforts have little impact on the incidence of tobacco-related diseases in this population. Additional smoking control interventions, such as smoking reduction therapy, are therefore required to treat this group. Our experience in Vienna shows that these smokers can be targeted through approaches that utilize new messages offering alternatives to cessation.",

      "abstract": "Reactions of novices to opiates range from extremely positive to completely negative, and the role these effects play in forming a drug habit has interested both scholars concerned with explaining the spread of heroin addiction and physicians troubled over the hazards of administering opiate medications. Although some observers have recently questioned heroin's euphoriant potential, research shows that many “normals” in laboratory studies and a majority of addicts on the street felt some euphoria during their first trial with an opiate. The higher proportion of euphoric responses among future addicts, commonly explained by reference to the prevalence of psychopathology in addict populations, is probably due to other differences as well. Subsequent opiate use where effects were unpleasant can still be traced to a continued interest in euphoria. Negative reactions caused some neophytes to discontinue use, but addicts-to-be were more motivated and learned from experienced users that undesirable side effects could be discounted as temporary and virtually all the addicts-to-be did achieve euphoria in a few tries. Thus, pre-dependence heroin use Is explained by pleasurable drug effects, but when exposure to euphoria occurs in a medical context, the risk of addiction Is minimal.",

      "abstract": "Stress is one of the common mental health problems in today's society. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between stress levels and smoking behavior. Smoking is a habit that is detrimental to health and can be a risk factor for a variety of serious diseases. However, many individuals who smoke may claim that smoking is their way of coping with stress. Data for the study were obtained through interviews and questionnaires given to several participants involved in smoking behavior. The data collected included stress levels, smoking history, and motivation to smoke. The results showed that there was a significant relationship between stress levels and smoking behavior. Individuals who experience higher levels of stress tend to be more likely to smoke or smoke more frequently. In addition, the study also revealed that many smoking participants reported that they smoked as a way to cope with stress. This study has important implications for treatments and interventions in reducing smoking. Understanding that stress can be a trigger for smoking can help in designing more effective evidence-based programs to help individuals cope with stress without having to rely on cigarettes. Better prevention and treatment efforts for individuals who smoke should also consider stress management as an important part of treatment. As such, the study could provide a better view of the complex relationship between stress and smoking and provide a foundation for better public health improvements in tackling the smoking problem",

      "title": "Characteristics of older dietary supplement users: review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Published literature reports rates of dietary supplement usage by individuals aged 60 years or more to be 16−60%. Prevalence figures are dependent on the population studied and the method of data collection. In general, older supplement users are female, Caucasian and well educated, with healthier lifestyle practices than non‐supplement users, and they are less likely to be overweight or to smoke. Neither income nor self‐rated health status are reliable predictors of supplement use in this group. In many cases older supplement users report higher intakes of several micronutrients from food than older non‐supplement users. Current patterns of supplement use by the older person reveal that although they consume a range of products, they do not supplement with nutrients that are of particular benefit to them. The supplements most commonly consumed by individuals aged 60 years and over are multivitamins and minerals, vitamin C and vitamin E preparations. There is insufficient data to quantify the dosage, frequency and duration of supplement use by the older population. Obtaining this information and data about herbal medicine use is an important step towards minimising the risk of drug–nutrient–herbal interactions. Identifying the health professionals who monitor the appropriateness and safety of supplement use in older individuals, particularly given the already high use of medication in this population, also needs to be a focus of future utilisation investigations. This systematic review of the literature published between 1982 and 2003 aims to measure the patterns of dietary supplement use by community‐living individuals aged 60 years and over and to profile the characteristics of older supplement users.",

Ten of the 16 had a previous substance abuse disorder (most commonly alcohol), two had a psychiatric diagnosis, and 14 of 16 were of the same sex. In addition, although subjects were not assessed for nicotine dependence, five were smokers who had a higher caffeine consumption than the nonsmokers. Obviously, caffeine consumption is markedly different from the use of drugs of abuse. For example, steadily increasing doses are generally not associated with caffeine ingestion and, of course, the destructive antisocial behavior provoked by drugs of abuse is clearly not associated with caffeine",

Sin ninguna base cientifica, muchos profesionales han considerado que el tratamiento antitabaquico en alcoholicos recientemente desintoxicados provoca recaidas etilicas. Por ello, habitualmente se pospone el tratamiento para dejar de fumar hasta el momento en que la abstinencia alcoholica esta mas consolidada. Sin embargo, aumentan las publicaciones de estudios que ponen entredicho esta creencia y cada vez es mas cuestionada la veracidad de este postulado. Cuando el abordaje terapeutico para el alcoholismo y tabaquismo es simultaneo, los resultados son mas evidentes en el caso del alcohol. Una posible explicacion de los pobres resultados en relacion al tabaco, podria residir en que hasta la fecha, los tratamientos antitabaquicos que se realizan en dichos estudios, son de baja intensidad.

      "title": "Introduction to Volume IV",
      "abstract": "The use of drugs for intoxication occupies a problematic space in the discussions of nineteenth-century inebriety. Physicians and reformers were familiar with alcohol consumption from first-hand experience, either of their own drinking or the drinking of people in their communities. Thus discussions about alcohol were not abstract. Notwithstanding that many of the images were stereotyped and at least moderately histrionic in construction, they drew upon familiar scenes and related to common (mis)conceptions of drink. The derelict drunk and the debased drinking space may have been tropes in nineteenth-century literature, but they were based upon familiarity. In contrast, drug inebriety was less common. Even though many people may have had experience with the effects of opium or other intoxicants (but most especially opium) through medical treatment, and even though some stories in popular fiction included elements of drug consumption, drug use was less public than drinking. As the chair of a mid-century select committee on intoxication in Canada West noted, drink was a public activity; opium consumption was done in private. 1 Moreover, as substances that were usually imported from faraway places, drugs like opium, cannabis, and cocaine were infused with exoticism, and racialized notions of the other. In much literature of the nineteenth century the meaning of opium, especially in its smoked form, was embedded in cultural myths of \"Asiatics\" or \"Chinamen\" in the Anglo-American world. Many of these images were delivered through the numerous accounts of westerners travelling throughout Asia as often brutal colonial regimes forced Asian nations to accept missionaries, most with a religious proselytization message, and almost always with a western superiority complex, into their territory.",

      "title": "Toxicology of Substances that Affect Performance and Behaviour",
      "abstract": "Abstract The use of drugs to enhance performance has become a matter of increasing concern in recent years. However, with the advent of a greater range of pharmacologically active substances, and the possibility of psychological or financial reward, the temptation to use drugs in the pursuit of enhanced sporting performance or body image has increased. Regulation of drugs in sport seeks to prevent the use of banned substances and techniques whilst allowing the legitimate use of therapeutic interventions for genuine medical conditions. The use of performance enhancing drugs may be accompanied by serious, even life threatening side effects. Performance enhancing drugs may be used at the time of competition, or as a ‘training aid’ outside the competitive season, for example to increase muscle bulk. Their effect may be to increase strength or to allow a greater power output, for example by increasing oxygen delivery to tissues. Abused drugs include androgenic anabolic steroids, creatine, beta‐2 agonists, beta blockers, peptide hormones and diuretics. Techniques to improve oxygen delivery include the use of high altitude training, autologous blood transfusions and the use of erythropoietin. Successful detection of abused drugs is fundamental for regulatory programs to be successful. Such programs should include random out of season testing, rigorous sample handling protocols and reliable analytical techniques. The advent of synthetic hormones with structures similar or identical to endogenous hormones presents significant regulatory challenges. Determination of the use of proscribed substances may involve setting threshold concentrations or defining acceptable ratios of different hormones. As more sophisticated techniques of abuse develop it may become necessary for regulatory programs to use increasingly invasive sampling techniques, to determine hormone profiles for individual athletes and even to undertake challenge tests which seek to differentiate endogenous from exogenous hormone production.",

Odour perception is both ortho and retronasal and both can alter. We know that over 250 drugs caused taste complaints and that zinc is not only essential for gustin but is also important with selenium in thyroid hormone metabolism. The development of novel foods using natural tastants as well as nutrient fortification and alternative modes of delivery are being developed in order to counteract the effects of conditions such as dementia and Parkinson’s disease. As well enjoyment, alteration in taste thresholds has an important safety aspect. Lower thresholds for salt recognition may result in individuals adding copious amounts of salt with resultant cardiovascular and metabolic consequences.

Our lifestyle can play a significant role in this. The aim of this review is to enhance public awareness of longevity and to emphasise the consequences of our daily habits.Materials and Methods. A literature review was carried out using the PubMed database, searching for the most recently published scientific sources.State of Knowledge. The review details the impact of individual lifestyle elements on quantity and quality of life. The benefits of physical activity were discussed, including the amount of exercise necessary per week to reduce mortality risk, and the most efficacious sport disciplines for health promotion. It also emphasises the significance of dietary habits and the role of phytochemicals. Additionally, it addresses the following questions: Does consuming small amounts of alcohol prolong life? What is the extent of the damage caused by smoking? How can stress and sleep be managed? Why are social relationships an important protective element? Finally, it considers whether there is a cure for longevity.Summary. A holistic approach that encompasses a sufficient level of physical activity, proper nutritional habits and the maintenance of a healthy body weight can contribute towards the attainment of longevity. Conversely, factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor stress or sleep management and loneliness can have a negative effect on life expectancy. A search is underway for anti-aging pharmacological compounds that are both efficacious and safe.",

The underlying causes are multiple and the diagnostic orientation depends on several anamnestic and clinical elements. The basic work-up includes biology and stool analysis. We present the case of a 14-year-old adolescent with chronic diarrhoea and weight loss for several months. Extensive complementary analyses were performed, all being totally negative. A careful repeated clinical history revealed that the patient had a significant nicotine intake, confirmed by a urine cotinine test. Withdrawal led to a resolution of the symptomatology. Nicotine consumption in the form of nicotine replacement products among young people is increasing rapidly. Nicotine has multiple health effects, including neurological, gastrointestinal and immune adverse effects.",

GTS occurs through skin exposure to dissolved nicotine from tobacco leaves. Symptoms of GTS include weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, abdominal cramps, breathing difficulty, abnormal temperature, pallor, diarrhoea, chills, fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate, and increased perspiration and salivation. The onset of the illness is three to 17 hours after exposure and the duration of illness is one to three days. Initial treatment includes cessation of work, change of clothing, showering, fluid intake, and rest. In more extreme cases, intravenous rehydration, anti-emetics, and dimenhydrinate are administered. Protective, water-resistant clothing; chemical-resistant gloves, boots, and socks; working in dry conditions; and dimenhydrinate can reduce the likelihood of contracting GTS. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> It is important to provide education to tobacco workers and employers about GTS. An international public awareness campaign about GTS timed to coincide with the tobacco harvest, along with enforced worker safety regulations, should be undertaken to protect the health of individuals working in tobacco production.",

Smoking not only causes detrimental effects on one's health, but also on one's social, professional and financial aspects of life as well. Despite knowing that smoking is dangerous and how it puts one's life at stake, many people ignore the risks and continue to smoke. A cigarette smoke contains more than 5000 chemicals, the main ingredients being tobacco and nicotine. At least 100 of these chemicals are carcinogenic, known to causecancers and other illnesses. Quitting cigarettes is not as hard as people think it is. It requires strong will power and motivation to quit smoking. Once a person becomes smoke free, the process of repair is initiated immediately. Within one week the person feels more energetic and healthy. Withinfew years the lungs become normal and return to their original state.

      "abstract": "This review examines the merits of 'food addiction' as an explanation of excessive eating (i.e., eating in excess of what is required to maintain a healthy body weight). It describes various apparent similarities in appetites for foods and drugs. For example, conditioned environmental cues can arouse food and drug-seeking behaviour, 'craving' is an experience reported to precede eating and drug taking, 'bingeing' is associated with both eating and drug use, and conditioned and unconditioned tolerance occurs to food and drug ingestion. This is to be expected, as addictive drugs tap into the same processes and systems that evolved to motivate and control adaptive behaviours, including eating. The evidence, however, shows that drugs of abuse have more potent effects than foods, particularly in respect of their neuroadaptive effects that make them 'wanted.' While binge eating has been conceptualised as form of addictive behaviour, it is not a major cause of excessive eating, because binge eating has a far lower prevalence than obesity. Rather, it is proposed that obesity results from recurrent overconsumption of energy dense foods. Such foods are, relatedly, both attractive and (calorie for calorie) weakly satiating. Limiting their availability could partially decrease excessive eating and consequently decrease obesity. Arguably, persuading policy makers that these foods are addictive could support such action. However, blaming excessive eating on food addiction could be counterproductive, because it risks trivialising serious addictions, and because the attribution of excessive eating to food addiction implies an inability to control one's eating. Therefore, attributing everyday excessive eating to food addiction may neither explain nor significantly help reduce this problem.",

      "title": "Electronic cigarettes, vaping-related lung injury and lung cancer: where do we stand?",
      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes have been considered a promising alternative to nicotine replacement products to help heavy tobacco smokers quit smoking. They work thanks to a heating coil causing evaporation of the liquid rapidly followed by cooling, thus creating an aerosol, a completely different mechanism from the combustion of tobacco in traditional cigarettes. The term 'vaping' indicates the use of electronic cigarettes or other devices to inhale heated, aerosolized nicotine, or other substances like cannabidiol, tetrahydrocannabinol, or butane hash oils together with solvents, mainly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine or their combination. A very fast increase of vaping among adolescents has been observed since electronic cigarettes and other vaping devices first appeared. Although electronic cigarettes have been advocated as a short-term cessation aid for tobacco smokers or as a long-term alternative, there is the concrete risk that they can be perceived by young nonsmokers as a less dangerous alternative to tobacco smoking, thus stimulating nonsmokers to start smoking rather than helping heavy tobacco smokers to quit smoking. Moreover, several cases of exogenous lipoid pneumonia and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with proven alveolar injury, as well as vaping-associated bronchiolitis obliterans, have been recently reported among electronic cigarette smokers, with severe clinical impact, thus posing the risk of the life-threatening toxic potential of vaping. At the moment, no definitive assessment can be made about the efficacy of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, and further studies are required about vaping-related life-threatening acute lung injury.",

The results of two field studies and one laboratory study showed that holding the volume of alcohol consumed constant and varying the haptic (i.e., weight) sensations individuals experience during consumption can influence these emotional responses and also perceived intoxication. Specifically, we manipulated haptic weight sensations by varying the weight of the cup/container (e.g., champagne flute) alcohol was consumed from and showed that consuming champagne from lighter (vs. heavier) flutes leads to enhanced positive feelings, reduced negative feelings, and increased perceived intoxication.",

      "title": "Nicotine: From plants to people",
      "abstract": "Nicotine is naturally present in many crops, including but not limited to tobacco, eggplant, and tomatoes. Only in the tobacco plant is nicotine present in high enough quantities (~2% of dry weight) to have pharmacological effects. People have recognized the stimulating effects of the smoke created by burning dried tobacco leaves for thousands of years, and cigarette smoking remains the most common form of nicotine uptake from tobacco. Decades of epidemiologic data show that smoking causes a number of serious diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Undoubtedly, the best way to avoid the harm from smoking is to never start. For current smokers, quitting smoking altogether is the most effective way to reduce the risk of harm and smoking-related disease. Along with other aspects such as taste and ritual, nicotine is one of the reasons people smoke. Nicotine, while addictive and not risk-free, is not the primary cause of smoking-related diseases. Indeed, experts agree that smoking-related diseases are caused primarily by chronic exposure to the harmful constituents that are produced when tobacco is burning. Nevertheless, many people still mistakenly believe that nicotine is a major cause of tobacco-related diseases. While nicotine-containing products should not be used by certain groups of people - such as minors, people with or at risk of heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, or seizure, pregnant or breast-feeding women or women who think they may be pregnant - delivery of nicotine by less harmful means can support public health goals by encouraging smokers who would otherwise continue smoking to switch to less harmful products. It is, therefore, pivotal to address the biggest misconceptions about nicotine to empower smokers to make informed decisions. In this article, we discuss basic facts about nicotine, its effects on the human body, as well as the risks related to nicotine consumption.",

      "title": "The Debate Surrounding Slow-Release Oxycodone",
      "abstract": "In recent weeks there have been numerous media reports of deaths among young people experimenting with illegal use of a slow-release oxycodone preparation. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a strong warning regarding this drug and the need to prescribe it cautiously. The reasons for the excessive number of deaths associated with the street use of slow-release oxycodone are not clear. One possible explanation is that in recent years opioids have been made available in higher oral and transdermal presentations for the management of cancer pain. These presentations make it much easier for patients who require escalating doses to receive adequate analgesia, but they are quite capable of causing death in an opioid-naïve patient. If an abuser crushes the slow-release pill and proceeds to snort it, inject it, or take it by mouth, the problem is compounded because of the very fast delivery of the opioid dose. This is highly likely to result in serious toxicity or death in the naïve person. It also is not clear why slow-release oxycodone is associated with more deaths than highly concentrated preparations of slow-release morphine or transdermal fentanyl. It may be related to the wider availability of this agent, or perhaps to the belief among street users of a stronger euphoriant effect compared with other opioids. There is still a widespread belief among street users about the stronger euphoriant properties of heroin as compared with morphine, although randomized controlled trials have failed to demonstrate significant differences. Similarly, randomized controlled trials conducted by our group and others have failed to demonstrate significant differences in either analgesia or side effects with slow-release oxycodone as compared with other opioids such as slow-release morphine. In recent years it has been clearly established that the majority of cancer patients will need at least one opioid rotation due to either side effects or incomplete analgesia. Therefore, the availability of different opioid formulations of very similar properties is necessary for optimal management of pain. It is important that highly concentrated opioid formulations be available for the management of cancer pain. One way to minimize the risk of severe toxicity or death related to the use of opioids by acquaintances of cancer patients is help patients and families understand that, while these agents are safe and effective for the patient because of the development of tolerance, they are potentially lethal to naïve friends or relatives who may ingest the agents. It will also be important to educate street users about the potential lethal effects associated with crushing and snorting or injecting these pills. The extremely high level of attention to this issue by the media is of great interest. Various media approached me for interviews four times within a period of approximately two weeks. The subject has also captured the attention of government officials and medical organizations such as the American Medical Association. In Canada, similar, or even more, attention has been given to the debate about legalization of heroin, and more recently marijuana, for terminally ill patients. It is important to ensure that the needs of cancer patients and their families in having access to different opioids and other effective drugs be protected. Unfortunately, however, despite the enormous publicity about these issues, there will be very little impact on the overall quality of life of advanced cancer patients and their families. The media, government, medical organizations, and the general public have only limited time to allocate to specific issues. The debate about specific drugs or issues such as euthanasia distracts from the public's understanding and ability to address the main problem for these patients—which is that the great majority of American patients with advanced cancer will unfortunately die without access to palliative care or adequate assessment and management of their physical and psychosocial suffering. There are significant barriers to increased access, including lack of trained physicians, lack of opportunities to train in palliative care, and serious financial and reimbursement issues. These problems are complex and do not lend themselves to sound-bite, simplistic coverage, no matter how well-meaning, by the media, public relations pronouncements by medical organizations, or piecemeal, one-issue legislation. We should not let this latest debate distract us from the larger issue of improving the day-to-day care of cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Drugs are widely discussed and broadcast in mass media, such as television shows and social networks. Drugs are often discussed because of their abuse in society. Drugs cause many problems in communities such as Indonesia. Drug addiction cases often occur in Indonesia, ranging from minors, teenagers, adults to the elderly. In fact, illegal drugs or narcotics and dangerous drugs were initially only intended for anesthesia during surgery, for medicinal purposes or could also be used as rituals in ancient times, but as times change and people get older, drug abuse is becoming more common. The situation of drug abuse in society could be caused by the influence of the social environment, or even by oneself.",

In emerging evidence, it is shown that e-cigarettes are not effective in helping adult smokers quit and that youth using e-cigarettes are at risk for becoming nicotine dependent and continuing to use as adults. Important gaps in our knowledge remain regarding the long-term health impact of e-cigarettes, effective strategies to prevent and reduce adolescent e-cigarette use, and the impact of provider screening and counseling to address this new method of nicotine use.",

With a different curing process and in the absence of combustion, several carcinogens are reduced, if not eliminated. Epidemiological studies in Sweden, where snus were developed and adopted by approximately 20% of males, have found few, if any, increases in oral/head cancers or cardiovascular risks. Although snus are considerably safer than cigarettes from the perspective of an individual smoker, from a broader societal perspective, at least three problems suggest the need for regulatory oversight: (1) Snus could serve as a “gateway” product for adolescents; (2) snus could serve as a temporary bridge/replacement product for smokers in situations in which cigarettes cannot be used, thus dampening their motivation to quit smoking; and (3) studies have found potentially heightened risks of pancreatic cancer, premature birth, dental disease, and oral lesions among users.",

Increasingly being sold as a dietary supplement, many people, particularly those in the health and fitness community, where it is touted as a fitness and muscle building aid, are consuming caffeine anhydrous on a daily basis. We report a case of fatal caffeine overdose in a 39-year-old man resulting from the self-administered ingestion of approximately 12 g of pure caffeine anhydrous. Autopsy blood caffeine levels were 350 mg/L. We recommend mandated labeling of pure caffeine anhydrous, highlighting the toxicity risk of ingesting this chemical; and we recommend ensuring that caffeine levels are included in the comprehensive forensic toxicology panel performed on all cases.",

Smokeless tobacco (ST) use among Indiana youngsters is higher than its use among youngsters nationally. More than 10% of current Indiana high school junior and senior female students report some ST usage. ST ingestion causes addiction and serious health consequences, including various forms of cancer and significant dental diseases. It is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. Nicotine levels in ST are very high, and ST intake is rapidly addicting. Tobacco companies have been accused of \"graduating\" youthful customers from flavored lower-nicotine \"starter\" products to forms that contain a more highly concentrated nicotine content. Clinicians should routinely ask children, teens and adults about ST use. Early intervention in youth who are experimenting with ST or using \"starter\" products may prevent addiction and disease. Physicians should be alert to the intraoral physical signs of ST use. To strengthen their tobacco intervention skills, physicians should require continuing education training regarding ST.",

      "title": "Driving While Stoned: Issues and Policy Options",
      "abstract": "Abstract THC is the most commonly detected intoxicant in US drivers, with approximately 13 % of drivers testing positive for marijuana use, compared to the 8 % that show a measurable amount of alcohol . Because cannabis use remains detectable for much longer than alcohol, and also for long after the driver is no longer impaired, the difference in rates does not show that stoned driving is more common than drunk driving. Nonetheless, cannabis intoxication while driving is on the rise and has been shown to impair reaction time and visual-spatial judgment. Many states, including those where cannabis sales are now permitted by state law, have laws against cannabis-impaired driving based on the drunk-driving model, defining criminally intoxicated driving as driving with more than a threshold amount of intoxicant in one’s bloodstream—a per se standard—as opposed to actual impairment. That approach neglects crucial differences between alcohol and cannabis in their detectability, their pharmacokinetics, and their impact on highway safety. Cannabis intoxication is more difficult to reliably detect chemically than alcohol intoxication. A breath alcohol test is (1) cheap and reliable; (2) sufficiently simple and non-invasive to administer at the roadside; and (3) a good proxy for alcohol in the brain, which in turn is (4) a good proxy for subjective intoxication and for measurable driving impairment. In addition, (5) the dose-effect curve linking blood alcohol to fatality risk is well-established and steep. None of those things is true for cannabis. A breath test remains to be developed. Oral-fluid testing can demonstrate recent use but not the level of impairment. A blood test requires a trained phlebotomist and therefore a trip to a medical facility, and blood THC levels drop very sharply over time-periods measured in minutes. Blood THC is not a good proxy either for recency of use or for impairment, and the dose-effect curve for fatality risk remains a matter of sharp controversy. The maximum risk for cannabis intoxication alone, unmixed with alcohol or other drugs, appears to be more comparable to risks such as talking on a hands-free cellphone (legal in all states) than to driving with a BAC above 0.08, let alone the rapidly-rising risks at higher BACs. Moreover, the lipid-solubility of THC means that a frequent cannabis user will always have measurable THC in his or her blood, even when that person has not used recently and is neither subjectively intoxicated nor objectively impaired. That suggests criminalizing only combination use, while treating driving under the influence of cannabis (however this is to be proven) as a traffic offense, like speeding.",

      "title": "Consommation de cannabis chez l'adolescent : quels sont les risques ; quels sont les outils à la disposition du médecin généraliste pour le dépistage et la prise en charge? État des connaissances au travers d'une revue de littérature",
      "abstract": "En France, le cannabis est la drogue illegale la plus repandue chez les jeunes. L'âge moyen de la premiere consommation se situe a 15,3 ans. Le jeune consommateur s'expose a des risques somatiques, psychologiques et sociaux souvent meconnus. Toutefois peu de medecins generalistes pensent devoir s'impliquer dans la prise en charge des usagers de cannabis. Une revue de litterature a ete effectuee pour faire le bilan des connaissances sur les risques lies a l'usage de cannabis chez l'adolescent et mettre en avant les outils d'aide a leur prise en charge au cabinet de medecine generale. L'objectif de cette etude est de permettre de consolider et d'etayer les notions actuelles afin de pouvoir prendre en charge de maniere optimale l'adolescent consommateur. Les etudes recentes montrent que, chez cette population, le cannabis agit en alterant la maturation cerebrale. En effet, la consommation induit l'apparition de troubles psychologiques tels que des troubles anxieux pouvant amener a la depression. On lui trouve egalement une responsabilite dans certains troubles cognitifs tels que la degradation des fonctions executives et de la memoire avec un effet-dose prouve surtout si l'exposition survient avant 15 ans, pouvant ainsi induire un echec scolaire. Des recommandations existent, basees sur le reperage precoce, l'evaluation et l'intervention breve. Des outils standardises sont a disposition du medecin generaliste afin de depister et d'evaluer les consommations. L'entretien motivationnel, l'intervention breve, les therapies systemiques sont autant de therapies ayant fait leurs preuves dans la prise en charge des jeunes consommateurs. La litterature nous montre que la consommation de cannabis chez l'adolescent est une problematique de sante publique qui doit interpeller le medecin generaliste dans sa pratique et l'inciter a reperer les sujets a risque. La prise en charge de l'adolescent usager reste complexe et necessite une approche globale psycho-sociale et familiale.",

Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours. Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache, drowsiness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression, sweating, nausea, hyperexcitability, irritability, and anxiety. Hangovers are rough. And the more you drink the night before, the more severe your hangover symptoms might feel the morning after. Most of the time you just need to drink water, eat some food, and walk it off. But if you’ve had too much to drink, you may be harming your body and need to see your doctor for treatment. Let’s look at how to tell the difference between a mild, temporary hangover that you can treat at home and one that may need some extra medical attention. Each of these 10 common symptoms stems from a physiological response to the presence of alcohol in your digestive and urinary systems, especially your stomach, kidneys, and bloodstream.",

      "abstract": "There are a large number of smokers who want to quit smoking but have failed in their attempts to do so, with many having been unsuccessful at quitting multiple times over their lifetime. The existing marketed nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) have only marginal effectiveness and none provide a comparable physiological response to that derived from cigarette smoking; that is, rapid absorption of nicotine from the lung leading to peak levels of nicotine in the bloodstream to target the receptors in the brain. Instead, existing NRTs produce a slower and delayed rise in nicotine blood levels which is less effective at reducing the craving sensations. Published data for electronic cigarettes show that they typically deliver nicotine with a profile closer to that for nicotine patches, with a slow rise that can take 30–60 min, or longer, to reach the same peak nicotine concentration that is produced in less than 3 min from a single cigarette. A number of attempts have been made to develop an inhaled product which would deliver the nicotine through the lung and mimic the physiological response from smoking, but many of them produced intolerable aversive reactions or delivered an ineffective dose. This paper discusses examples of the potential for the recent inhaled nicotine products in development to be effective as NRTs, but is not meant to be a comprehensive review.",

Chemotherapy has not been shown to produce dramatic losses of taste or smell, but systematic studies on various chemotherapeutic agents and types of cancer are lacking. Radiation therapy does produce clear losses of both taste and smell. Both chemotherapy and radiation therapy alter the pleasure produced by taste and smell through the formation of conditioned aversions. That is, foods consumed in proximity with the nausea of therapy come to be unpleasant. The impact of conditioned aversions can be diminished by providing a scapegoat food just before therapy. Alterations in foods may be beneficial to the cancer patient. Increasing the concentrations of flavor ingredients can compensate for sensory losses, and providing pureed foods that retain the cognitive integrity of a meal can benefit the patient who has chewing or swallowing problems.",

The transfer of positive research findings to the competitive environment has proved problematic for some individuals. More recent applications involve serial ingestion of bicarbonate over several days before competition or during high-intensity training sessions over a few weeks. A number of research questions need to be addressed to enhance applications of bicarbonate loading in the elite sport environment.

      "title": "Reducing risk in smokers",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For smokers who want to quit, nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion are frequently recommended. Currently, disagreement surrounds the extent of risk reduction from quitting, the consequences of the change of nicotine replacement therapy to over-the-counter status, and the safety and efficacy of new tobacco products being marketed by tobacco companies. This article reviews the current evidence relevant to these and other developments in smoking interventions and describes the most effective strategies that smokers can use to reduce their risk. Recent findings Although it may take approximately 10 to 30 years of abstinence for former smokers’ risk of lung cancer to reach that of never smokers, quitting at any time is substantially less risky than continuing to smoke. Quitting after diagnosis also prolongs survival. Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy are effective pharmacotherapies, doubling quit rates compared with self-quitting. However, many users of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy are using it inappropriately. More research is needed to determine the long-term health effects of modified tobacco products and their efficacy in helping smokers quit. Switching to “low tar” filter cigarettes to reduce lung cancer risk, however, is clearly ineffective. The most effective interventions for quitting continue to be a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic approaches. Summary Health care practitioners should encourage all smokers to attempt cessation and emphasize pharmacotherapy as an important aid to quitting. Professionals who educate patients on the appropriate use of pharmacotherapy and follow-up on smokers’ attempts to quit will help reduce the societal burden and personal risks of smoking.",

The basic model shows that the stationary status of an alcoholic is improved by the difference between his rate of time preference and the rate of return on his status and that this improvement is amplified by the ratio of the instantaneous suffering-relief effect to the status-eroding effect of alcohol. The extended model shows that society’s reaction to alcoholism may lead to permanent cyclical alcohol consumption.",

      "abstract": "Over-the-counter dietary supplements to treat obesity appeal to many patients who desire a \"magic bullet\" for weight loss. Asking overweight patients about their use of weight-loss supplements and understanding the evidence for the efficacy, safety, and quality of these supplements are critical when counseling patients regarding weight loss. A schema for whether physicians should recommend, caution, or discourage use of a particular weight-loss supplement is presented in this article. More than 50 individual dietary supplements and more than 125 commercial combination products are available for weight loss. Currently, no weight-loss supplements meet criteria for recommended use. Although evidence of modest weight loss secondary to ephedra-caffeine ingestion exists, potentially serious adverse effects have led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban the sale of these products. Chromium is a popular weight-loss supplement, but its efficacy and long-term safety are uncertain. Guar gum and chitosan appear to be ineffective; therefore, use of these products should be discouraged. Because of insufficient or conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of conjugated linoleic acid, ginseng, glucomannan, green tea, hydroxycitric acid, L-carnitine, psyllium, pyruvate, and St. John's wort in weight loss, physicians should caution patients about the use of these supplements and closely monitor those who choose to use these products.",

The cause of this inconsistency is unclear. Using theoretical models of preference reversal and econometric empirical analysis, this study finds that the number of calories eaten per meal increases and the quality of the diet decreases as people wait more than six hours to eat their next meal, work more than fifty hours a week, and consume a larger amount of food away from home. These situational factors are important even for consumers who have considerable knowledge about diet and health. Regardless of one's favored dietary prescription, this study shows how well an individual's intentions to eat healthfully changes with time pressures, hunger, and food source. As people change their dietary goals based on prevailing nutritional lore, such situational factors will continue to interfere with one's long-term health objectives. This is especially relevant in an era where obesity is a leading health issue for individuals and for the costs of health care. Any advice and action that can improve diet quality and reduce caloric intake on a convenient basis is valuable for individuals and the overall economy.",

Nicotine has been used extensively in physiology laboratories to understand human and animal nervous systems. In 1967, Lichtneck and Lundgren, two doctors from the University of Lund, proposed the development of a nicotine-containing chewing gum. Nicotine replacement therapy is now widely used in smoking cessation practice and is available in many forms including electronic cigarettes and other vaping devices. Nicotine is produced by the plant for its own benefit as a deterrent to sap-sucking insects, and it is an effective insecticide.",

      "title": "The biomedicalisation of smoking cessation: a mixed methods study of lay perspectives on nicotine addiction",
      "abstract": "Biomedical models of addiction are becoming increasingly prevalent in public discourse about cigarette smoking, however there is some concern that smoking is becoming overly medicalised. Neuroscience research has revealed that nicotine use is associated with long-lasting changes in the brain, and these findings are being presented in the media and in advertising campaigns for smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. The “brain disease model of addiction”, which posits that chronic drug use leads to long-term changes in brain networks that make it very difficult to quit, is increasingly being applied to tobacco dependence. This is controversial in the tobacco control field, where population-based strategies have been successful in reducing the prevalence of smoking. Proponents of a biomedical model of tobacco dependence believe that it will lead to increased treatment seeking, more efficacious treatments, and a reduction in stigma. Critics of a biomedical model of nicotine addiction have expressed concerns that it will reduce individual responsibility for smoking, increase stigma, and undermine individuals’ beliefs in their ability to quit. While these competing views on the impacts of biomedical models of addiction have been debated in the academic literature, it is unknown to what extent members of the public endorse a biomedical model of tobacco dependence, and have incorporated it into their everyday understandings of smoking. This research examined the influence of biomedical discourses of smoking on lay beliefs of Australian smokers and non-smokers about tobacco dependence and its treatment. It also explored daily smokers’ attitudes to the labelling of nicotine addiction as a “brain disease.” A mixed methods approach was used to ascertain the extent to which biomedical understandings of smoking have been incorporated into lay discourse on smoking and quitting; how Australian smokers understand nicotine addiction and the role of the brain; and how endorsement of the brain disease model of addiction may be related to smokers’ attitudes towards smoking cessation and preferences for quitting methods. The thesis is comprised of three studies. Firstly, a secondary analysis of data from interviews with 55 members of the general public, including never smokers, ex-smokers and current smokers. The data was analysed to ascertain public attitudes on the best methods for quitting smoking. Results revealed that while cessation medications were frequently described as a helpful means to quit, the role of willpower, choice, and motivation were seen as central. Medications were often described as a “second line of defence”, or as aids to be used alongside counselling or behavioural strategies. A second qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 29 daily smokers about their views on smoking cessation and their understanding of the role of the brain in smoking. The results revealed positive attitudes to quitting without assistance. Cessation medications were not perceived as magic bullets, and willpower and personal responsibility were emphasised. While many smokers were aware that smoking affected their brain, few agreed it was a brain disease. Participants expressed concerns that biomedical understandings of smoking could increase the stigma of smoking, diminish personal responsibility for cessation, and deter smokers from seeking treatment. These qualitative results informed the design of a quantitative survey completed by 1538 Australian smokers. This survey examined endorsement of neurobiological explanations of smoking, and their relationship to self-efficacy and treatment preferences. Approximately one third of participants agreed that smoking was a brain disease and more than half agreed that smoking changes the chemistry of the brain. Endorsement of the brain disease label, and agreement that smoking changes the chemistry of the brain, were associated with greater intention to use cessation medications. However the effect sizes were small, suggesting that beliefs about smoking and the brain may have modest real world impact. Contrary to the claim that promotion of brain-based explanations of smoking will increase feelings of fatalism, this survey shows that agreement with the claim that smoking is a brain disease was associated with higher self-efficacy. A medical, or chronic disease, model that emphasises the role of neurochemistry in tobacco dependence, while becoming more dominant in academic discourse, was not accepted by most Australian smokers. Concerns about negative consequences of describing smoking in this way, and wariness about the motives behind public health anti-smoking campaigns, were reasons behind this rejection. Consistent with existing literature on lay understandings of health and illness, alternatives discourses that describe it as a matter of willpower, choice, and a habit, remain strongly rooted in public dialogue about smoking. This means that smokers are unlikely to see the terminology of smoking as a “brain disease” positively. However, smokers were interested in information about the effects of smoking on the brain, and further research should investigate constructive ways of presenting this information in health promotion material and clinical interactions. Biomedical explanations of smoking should acknowledge the agency of individuals and the complexity of addiction to cigarettes in order to be believable and acceptable to smokers.",

As pointed out with regard to attributing causation between alcohol use and alcohol related problems: 'Causality here is not a matter of Newtonian physics, and uncertainty is part of every equation' (Edwards et al., 1994). The uncertainty in attributing causation is all the greater with substances other than alcohol and tobacco. Users of illicit drugs seldom use only one drug exclusively. Heroin users in some countries, for example, will often use benzodiazepines. In many countries the majority of illicit drug users also use tobacco. Attributing causality to the use of a particular drug is therefore difficult.",

These choices involve both motivational and executive function processes. Problems arise when there is excessive motivation to eat and low impulse control, a situation we have termed reinforcement pathology. Motivational and executive function processes have also been implicated in the development of drug dependence and addiction. In this review we discuss the application of reinforcement pathology to obesity, and implications of this approach for obesity treatment.",

The aim of the systematic review was to determine the influence of caffeine on cardiorespiratory functions and physical performance. The method was the collection of relevant literature in the period from 2011-2022, and their analysis. The results clearly show the benefit and positive influence of caffeine on both investigated areas. The recommended consumption of caffeine should be higher than 75mg in order to expect positive changes and effects. Also, doses above 600mg should not be exceeded due to side effects, especially on the heart. It is necessary to consume caffeine for at least 45 minutes before the planned activity to ensure complete absorption. Caffeine is a very powerful supplement, it is only necessary to take care of the method and amount of dosage.",

Lo que surgio en forma de jarabe, como un remedio casero para los problemas digestivos, eleva cada dia mas su oferta y demanda. Su consumo, entre otros efectos, es capaz de producir sensacion de placer en las personas, lo que la llevo a ser consumida de manera abusiva. Sin embargo, sus compuestos ocasionan grandes y graves problemas de salud que pueden llevar a convertirse en un adicto o, inclusive, a la muerte. Objetivo: Describir las causas y consecuencias del consumo abusivo de Coca Cola. Metodos: Estudio descriptivo de corte longitudinal retrospectivo. Resultados: El dulce y refrescante sabor de la bebida y la presencia de compuestos como cafeina, la atropina y la egnonina, que contiene en menor porcentaje, explican el componente adictivo de la Coca Cola. Entre los componentes toxicos se destaca el acido fosforico, que tiene un efecto corrosivo. La aparicion de diabetes mellitus, anemia, perdida del esmalte de los dientes, envejecimiento y obesidad, forman parte de los efectos daninos a la salud. La sustitucion por otras bebidas mas inocuas, forma parte del tratamiento. Conclusiones: La cafeina constituye su principal componente adictivo, el consumo con fines de placer provoca serios problemas de salud.

I show that allowing for the effect to occur gradually over several years leads to the conclusion that a rise in cigarette prices is actually associated with a long-run reduction in body mass index and obesity. This result is robust to the different ethodologies used in the literature. I also provide evidence that indirect effects on exercise and food consumption may explain the counterintuitive result. I hypothesize that people who quit smoking experience a renewed interest in their health, increased confidence in their self-control, and a replenished stock of willpower, causing them to make healthier decisions in other areas as well.",

Surveys of police detainees and those incarcerated show that cannabis use is more prevalent among these groups than the general community. Police strategies that involve proactive policing and include effective partnerships with other stakeholders in their local community may be the most effective strategies in regards to drug law enforcement.

Em se tratando da diferenca entre os sexos, os efeitos do alcool sao mais rapidos no sexo feminino, visto a maior proporcao de tecido gorduroso, por variacoes no decorrer do ciclo menstrual e por diferencas na concentracao gastrica do metabolismo do alcool. Uma das possiveis formas de analisar o enfrentamento da dependencia de alcool se da atraves do conceito de resiliencia de um individuo, compreendida como sendo a habilidade de um individuo para se recuperar das adversidades e se adaptar positivamente em situacoes de tensao e estresse. O uso excessivo de alcool pode afetar, ainda, a qualidade de vida do ser humano, seja individual ou social, causando doencas, no figado, estomago e/ou depressao, problemas no trabalho, de cunho legal ou algum episodio de violencia. O presente estudo tem por objetivo analisar a resiliencia e a qualidade de vida de mulheres que fazem uso excessivo de alcool em Joao Pessoa – PB. A dificuldade em encontrar uma amostra com caracteristicas tao peculiares, faz desta populacao, rara ou de dificil acesso. Como alternativa para estudar esse tipo de populacao o Respondent Driven Sampling (amostragem dirigida ao participante) se mostrou eficiente, pois utiliza como forma de recrutamento a possibilidade de calcular a probabilidade de selecao de um individuo indicado aderir a pesquisa. E importante ressaltar a dificuldade na realizacao do metodo visto a ideia de estimulos financeiros ou bonificacoes que nao e permitida pelos comites de etica brasileiros. O metodo permitiu analisar informacoes de 36 mulheres. Destas, 9 eram sementes que buscavam apoio no no CAPSad III, Centro POP e Ruartes. Todas consumiam o alcool em combinacao com outras drogas, especialmente a maconha e o cigarro. Com o AUDIT foi possivel observar que as mulheres necessitavam de avaliacao diagnostica e tratamento, visto que 80,6% estavam na zona de risco 4. O WHOQOL-bref evidenciou a baixa qualidade de vida dessas mulheres, principalmente no que se refere ao meio ambiente. O CD-RISC10 atenta para o baixo nivel de resiliencia. E importante ressaltar que ao analisar o nivel de resiliencia em relacao as zonas de risco do AUDIT observou-se que as mulheres que estao na zona 4 possuem, em sua maioria, resiliencia intermediaria a baixa. Os resultados evidenciaram que resiliencia esta associada a religiao, ao uso de crack, antidepressivos e cigarro, e pelos dominios 1(Fisico), 2 (Psicologico) e 4 (Meio ambiente) de qualidade de vida. Com o presente estudo foi possivel observar a magnitude dos problemas advindos do uso excessivo de alcool para mostrar a importância de apresentar a sociedade o quao complexa e essa problematica, de modo que possamos expor ao governo como auxilia-los a tomar as decisoes cabiveis para apoiar, nao apenas as mulheres, mas todos os que precisam de ajuda para tratar o vicio do alcool.",

      "abstract": "Summary It is widely accepted that tobacco use is primarily a problem of drug dependence, with nicotine serving as the addictive agent. Nicotine itself is of some value as a therapeutic aid for people trying to give up smoking. The possible applications in this area of a different class of drug, nicotine antagonists, are reviewed. The receptor mediating the main central effects of nicotine resembles nicotinic‐cholinoceptive sites in ganglia of the autonomic nervous system; drugs which block ganglionic transmission also block the central effects of nicotine, including the positively reinforcing effect sought by smokers. Possible sub‐populations of smokers who might benefit from antagonist therapy are proposed, and the advantages and limitations of such an approach are discussed. Future prospects probably depend on the development of agents with more selective effects than those presently available.",

Should I encourage adolescents to choose e-cigarettes over regular cigarettes if they decide to smoke? Are e-cigarettes less harmful and a potential smoking cessation method for adolescents? Answer While e-cigarettes do not have carcinogenic tobacco, most contain nicotine, which not only leads to addiction, but can also impair brain development and cognitive function in youth. Recent studies have also shown that adolescents who use e-cigarettes are more likely to begin smoking tobacco cigarettes. It is therefore essential that physicians explain to adolescents the risks and health concerns e-cigarettes present, and implement measures to prevent or cease e-cigarette use.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco addiction is one of the oldest known addictions with annual death toll of three million. And India is the second largest consumer of tobacco in the world because of easy availability of variety of smoking and smokeless tobacco products in the market. This has made the situating very complex in India, as the same tobacco generating billions of revenues for India is also a financial burden over the health care sector. Tobacco is a risk factor for approximately 50 serious health care diseases including infertility. But it is surprising that only 22% of the general population are familiar with the reproductive risks associated with smoking. This shear ignorance has led to increase in smoking among women too. Tobacco use not only decrease fecundity and reproductive potential of the individual, but also causes relationship disharmony among the already emotional wrecked infertile couple. Though this stress might be the contributory factor towards tobacco abuse but ironically this tobacco use further escalates the financial ‘stress’ in these couples. Multiple attempts may be required during the process of quitting and the likelihood of success increases with each attempt. The ultimate key is counselling, education, and encouragement at each clinical visit.",

The nadir was reached during World War II; not only had usage gone down prior to those hostilities, but it declined even further as the disruption of international transportation cut down on supplies. From being easily available and commonly used, heroin, morphine and cocaine almost faded out of nonmedical situations: when someone was caught with drugs, the event elicited headlines and comment. Once commonplace, narcotics use waned into little more than rumors about this physician or that movie star. Personal knowledge of a “dope fiend” was unusual for the vast majority of Americans by the 1950s.",

      "title": "Should I Stop Smoking",
      "abstract": "1. The Problem A few weeks ago I firmly decided to stop smoking. There are many good prudential reasons for this decision: the health risks, the economic cost, the regular morning-cough, the smell in my home, the troubles I have to go through in order to satisfy my addiction in an increasingly non-smoking society, the uneasy experience of being controlled by the habit and the accompanying loss of dignity. And then there are the health risks, of course. Slow death in lung cancer is hardly appealing and neither are the other various troubles that without doubt will hit me within the next twenty years. Add to these all the benevolent reasons which could be mobilised in support of the same thesis (dangers for people in my surroundings, the smell of my clothes and my body and other inconveniences to them caused by my disgusting habit), and the case for my obligation to stop smoking seems overwhelming, no matter what set of basic ethical norms and values is applied. There is one problem, however ? a problem I share with many other smokers: I have a weak character. I could, if I flexed the muscles of my will-power to their extreme, probably endure the problems of abstinence. However, in past attempts to 'kick the habit' I have never in fact done so and this is due to my strong tendency to yield to the temptation of the moment. But, since I in fact have such a lousy character, may I not as well yield immediately? Would the few weeks of pointless struggle really amount to anything more than sheer masochism: agony leading up to nothing? Might I not just as well have another cigarette immediately, thereby avoiding a non-negliable amount of pointless suffering? Intuitively, the correct answer to these questions seems to be affirmative. I should, therefore, have another cigarette. But since the same reasoning applies to any single cigarette I may smoke in the future, and since to stop smoking involves abstaining from each such cigarette, this line of reasoning seems to lead back to the negation of the thesis above: I should not stop smoking! This, then, is the problem I want to address: Can the just outlined paradox be resolved, and, if so, should I really try to stop smoking in light of the facts about my weak character? It is a real problem, I should know, because the story I have told is about myself and it is true. But how should we reflect on it? I will approach it from two different viewpoints: first, from the perspective of normative ethics and, secondly, from the perspective of decision theory. My conclusion will be somewhat perplexing: on the one hand, although partly faulty, the reasoning sketched above is mostly correct, but, on the other, people like me (people with a weak character, that is) should in general avoid to think along such (albeit correct) lines.",

Weight gain, reported by most of the subjects, was not a significant reason given for resuming smoking. Caution is urged in interpreting stated reasons for return to cigarette use since many seem to be guilt-reducing justifications for succumbing to intense cravings to smoke.",

De hecho, ha pasado de ser una region de produccion y transito a una de consumo. A todo esto se suma el incremento sostenido de la violencia, que muchos atribuyen de manera directa a las drogas. El articulo analiza la relacion entre drogas y violencia y asegura que no es posible concluir que haya un vinculo directo de causalidad entre ambas. Se trata en realidad de un tema muy complejo que deberia debatirse seriamente, incluyendo las propuestas de despenalizacion, aunque hasta ahora las posiciones se fundamentan en temas valoricos y morales antes que en datos empiricos",

We present and discuss the case of a man in his 20s who was in continuous alcoholic intoxication until he finally abused with methanol and was admitted to a hospital, where he died six days later. When it comes to intoxication, there are often no apparent findings that could help in determining the cause and manner of death.

Such placebo-like effects are typically attributed to conditioning, motivation, or expectations about product efficacy. The present research shows such effects can also occur because, under some conditions, people are more prone to underestimate the time to onset of products they have used in the past. These recollections of too short a time to onset alter people’s experience of products and cause them to report more rapid effects. Participants who were led to believe there was a strong causal link between having consumed a product and improved performance on a task recalled that less time elapsed before they experienced an effect. In subsequent consumption, they felt comfortable using the product later in time, started working on a similar task earlier upon use, experienced the product’s effect sooner, and were less inclined to switch to competing products.",

      "abstract": "Long-term smoking for several years has been known to cause severe ailments in humans from the beginning. Even after knowing that this dangerous addiction is a life-threatening deal, still, ironically, the prevalence of smoking is more or less not getting reduced to a desirable extent. Those who smoke are becoming miserable because of their habit of smoking. Still, on the other hand, due to passive smoking, many more innocent lives are also adversely affected for no fault. This aspect of smoking, i.e., passive or second-hand smoking, is a fearful complication of smoking which is seldom seen with other modes of addiction. Time and again, numerous researches have highlighted the adverse effects of smoking on the human body and the interference it does bring in one's life. Smoking contributes to the deterioration of many preexisting ailments and depletes many valuable aspects of the human body. Smoking thus has a devastating effect on almost all of the tissues of our body and thus exerts its effect on nearly all the major organs. This review article is made by analysing various findings from many researches conducted across the globe by having a thorough search of Pubmed database, which in turn is the main methodology of the article. This review article aims to provide a simple and subtle understanding of the ill effects of smoking on the human body by serving the readers with a readymade platter of comprehensive knowledge about smoking coupled with efforts to eliminate the associated myths.",

      "abstract": "Testosterone is among the oldest drugs in medicine. It has a long efficacy and safety record for its prime role of androgen replacement therapy in men with androgen deficiency. Testosterone and synthetic analogue androgens have also been used in pharmacological androgen therapy (PAT) to produce androgenic effects on marrow, muscle or bone. Although PAT is increasingly being superseded by newer, more expensive drugs, androgens remain cost-effective in many older applications. Androgen misuse is the systematic over-prescribing for unproven medical indications. Misuse is increasingly evident for male ageing (\"andropause\") and some other clinical conditions. Further trials for new indications for androgens require reliable safety data, but rising costs may make it increasingly attractive to circumvent the need for evidence by promoting off-label mass marketing. Androgen abuse is the illicit self-administration of often massive doses of androgens for non-medical purposes — notably power sports and body building. In parallel with effective detection reducing androgen abuse in elite sports, more focus is needed on non-sporting cosmetic, recreational and occupational androgen abuse. Despite ongoing androgen misuse and abuse, testosterone remains under-prescribed for younger men with classical androgen deficiency that frequently remains undiagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Energy drinks are frequently marketed to individuals interested in athletics and an active lifestyle. From 2001 to 2008, estimates of energy drink use in adolescent to middle-aged populations ranged from 24% to 56%. Most energy drinks feature caffeine and a combination of other components, including taurine, sucrose, guarana, ginseng, niacin, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin. This article examines the evidence for 2 commonly purported uses of energy drinks: athletic performance enhancement and weight loss. Observed ergogenic benefits of energy drinks are likely attributable to caffeine and glucose content. There is conflicting evidence regarding the impact of energy drinks on weight loss, although some data suggest that combining energy drink use with exercise may enhance body fat reduction. As with any pharmacologically active substance, energy drinks are associated with adverse effects. Combining energy drinks with alcohol exacerbates safety concerns and is an increasingly common practice contributing to toxic jock identity among college-aged male athletes. Practitioners should monitor identified populations likely to consume these loosely regulated beverages.",

      "abstract": "The attitude towards alcohol is ambiguous and mainly depending upon the role attributed to it:as a stimulant, as a pharmacon or as a drug the person may be addicted to. Acute and chronic alcohol intoxication may be followed by psychic and somatic leasons. As far as pregnancy is concerned, leasons due to chronic alcohol consume have to be considered as maternal factors of high risk to the pregnancy. Acute alcohol intoxication may be harmful for the pregnancy as well as gametogenesis and gametes and embryo. Alcohol has been used in obstetrics as an analgetic during delivery, for premedication in obstetrical operations, for elimination of edema in toxicosis, as an abortifacient and as adjuvant in termination of lactation. Critical evaluation shows that these indications are only of historical value. Today more effective and specific compounds are available and as for the narcotic effect is concerned the dosage of the new narcotics of course is more exact. Alcohol recently has been proposed as a tocolytic agent. Although today other tocolytics are available, it should be kept in mind as a substitute if the use of beta-mimetic substances is not possible. The controversy about the value of alcohol in therapy or prevention of newborn hyperbilirubinaemie is not yet resolved, but should be clarified since this therapy--if of value--would constitute one of the rare possibilities to interfere with the fetal metabolism.",

Between one quarter and one third of all homicides are due to alcohol. Increasing the price of alcohol, reducing its availability, and redesigning drinking venues can all reduce alcohol-related violence. Banning alcohol advertising is also likely to reduce alcohol-related violence, since such advertising increases the risk of drinking that is risky for violence. Alcohol-related violence is set to increase as more of the world’s population start to drink alcohol, fuelled by the marketing strategies of the alcohol industry. Alcohol, a cause of significant harm to people other than the drinker, is the only major ‘psychoactive drug of abuse’ not subject to international legal regulation.",

      "abstract": "Junk food is analogous to slang language used. Junk food had a dire impact on the mental and physical health. Knowingly or unknowingly people get attracted towards it without knowing how harmful it is on our mind and body. Advertisement and social media play very important role in sales and consumption of junk food. A short-term benefit has worst effect not only on our bodies but also on our productivity. Some of the Junk food also include harmful chemicals and salt which can adversely affect our health. Eating appropriate food at right time is equally important. Awareness about the worst side effect of junk food will help to avoid from the healthy diet regimen. Home-made food and balance diet awareness is lacking among most of the people in today’s busy and digital world. Wrong food practices may lead to major health issues like cardia attack, dyslexia etc. This study shed light on the reasons of popularity of junk food, contribution of junk foods to poor health, effect of junk food on productivity, corporate role for employee’s health and awareness and reasons for avoiding the junk food.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Popular energy drinks containing caffeine, taurine or guarana are currently generating a lot of interest. Their supply is an increasingly popular method of boosting the body. Therefore, it is important to know the effects of such drinks on health. Objective: A review of the literature on the health effects of energy drinks with a focus on the value of their consumption in athletes. Current Knowledge: Many studies have been made and numerous medical cases have been analyzed to assess the health effects of energy drinks. The most commonly described complications are those involving the cardiovascular and neurological systems, but there are also cases of gastrointestinal, kidney, gynecological or skin diseases. The severity of these complications depends on the amount of energy drinks consumed and the time interval in which they were drunk. Nowadays, athletes are increasingly turning to energy drinks to boost their performance. It is also noticeable that children and adolescents who should not consume caffeine or sugar in excess consume this type of drink. Conclusions: The growing popularity of energy drinks, including among professional athletes as well as children and adolescents, is leading to an increasing number of complications due to their excessive consumption. Therefore, further research on their health effects and harmfulness is needed to determine their safe use.",

      "title": "Weight Loss Nutritional Supplements",
      "abstract": "Obesity has reached what may be considered epidemic proportions in the United States, not only for adults but for children. Because of the medical implications and health care costs associated with obesity, as well as the negative social and psychological impacts, many individuals turn to nonprescription nutritional weight loss supplements hoping for a quick fix, and the weight loss industry has responded by offering a variety of products that generates billions of dollars each year in sales. Most nutritional weight loss supplements are purported to work by increasing energy expenditure, modulating carbohydrate or fat metabolism, increasing satiety, inducing diuresis, or blocking fat absorption. To review the literally hundreds of nutritional weight loss supplements available on the market today is well beyond the scope of this chapter. Therefore, several of the most commonly used supplements were selected for critical review, and practical recommendations are provided based on the findings of well controlled, randomized clinical trials that examined their efficacy. In most cases, the nutritional supplements reviewed either elicited no meaningful effect or resulted in changes in body weight and composition that are similar to what occurs through a restricted diet and exercise program. Although there is some evidence to suggest that herbal forms of ephedrine, such as ma huang, combined with caffeine or caffeine and aspirin (i.e., ECA stack) is effective for inducing moderate weight loss in overweight adults, because of the recent ban on ephedra manufacturers must now use ephedra-free ingredients, such as bitter orange, which do not appear to be as effective. The dietary fiber, glucomannan, also appears to hold some promise as a possible treatment for weight loss, but other related forms of dietary fiber, including guar gum and psyllium, are ineffective.",

In contrast, alcohol consumption was associated with a mixed effect on biological aging and pronounced nonlinear effects. At low and heavy levels of alcohol consumption, there was accelerated biological aging, whereas at intermediate levels of consumption there was a relative decelerating effect. The decelerating effects of alcohol were particularly notable at loci for which methylation increased with age.These data support prior epidemiological studies indicating that moderate alcohol use is associated with healthy aging, but we urge caution in interpreting these results. Conversely, smoking has strong negative effects at all levels of consumption. These results also support the use of methylomic indices as a tool for assessing the impact of lifestyle on aging.",

      "title": "Editorial: Vaping and Cardiovascular health � An opportunity or a risk?",
      "abstract": "The history of smoking dates back to the ancient times and mankind has been smoking different plant materials for the leisure and addiction. One of its kind, tobacco cigarette smoking was introduced in the 19th century and its use increased exponentially by the mid of 20th century. Initially it was thought that the tobacco cigarette smoking had some medicinal properties but as the rate of tobacco smoking increased, the adverse effects started appearing and by the end of 20th century it was a well-known fact that tobacco cigarette smoking was a health hazard and a major risk factor for the fatal diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases1. With the emergent side effects and health hazards tobacco cigarette smoking was discouraged on a larger scale in the society and the search for the alternative to it led to the creation of E-cigarettes in the early 21st century.&#x0D; Since the introduction of vaping i.e., use of E-cigarettes, E-hookahs, vape pens or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), it is taken as a safe alternative of tobacco cigarettes smoking and a way to help in smoking cessation2. The perception of less harmful tobacco smoking substitute, extensive marketing and a vogue of vaping have resulted in an explosive increase in the use of vaping devices among the former smokers, current smokers and even in never smoker adolescents and young adults in the past two decades. According to the National Health Interview Survey (NIHS), the number of E-cigarette users increased to 8.1 million in United States in 20183 and according to National Youth Tobacco Survey in US 19.6% of high school students and 4.7% of middle school students are regular users of E-cigarettes4.&#x0D; Most vaping devices are made up of four components, including: a cartridge or pod containing e-liquid, a metallic heating coil, a battery and a mouthpiece. The e-liquid contains chemicals like propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavoring substance and varying amount of nicotine. Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin act as solvent carriers. When a person puffs/inhales, it activates the heating coil that causes the e-liquid to vaporize that is inhaled by the person. The vapors or aerosols that are inhaled deliver certain chemicals into the body that are mainly:&#x0D; &#x0D; Nicotine&#x0D; Organic volatile compounds generated by heating of solvent carriers such as glycols, glycerin, toluene that cause irritation to the eyes, oral and laryngeal mucosa.&#x0D; Carbonyls such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, acrolein and glyoxal which are carcinogenic and cause extensive damage to the lungs.&#x0D; Chemical present in flavoring agents like Diacetyl, acetyl propionyl and acetoin cause severe asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans&#x0D; The contaminants that may be the tobacco derived alkaloids and nitrosamines&#x0D; Metal particles from the heating coils like chromium, cadmium, nickel, lead; and particles of copper, nickel, and silver&#x0D; &#x0D; These chemicals are responsible for the injuries to the respiratory mucosa, skin and are considered as carcinogens.&#x0D; The cardiovascular effects of vaping are mediated by:&#x0D; &#x0D; Nicotine, it has been demonstrated that activation of nicotinic Ach receptors causes release of catecholamines and promotes hemodynamic alterations, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and arrhythmogenesis5.&#x0D; Increased oxidative stress that is produced due to aerosolized chemicals, metals, particulates and acrolein. It causes generation of oxygen derived free radical species causing inflammation and damage to the endothelial cells, reduced bioavailability of NO, plaque destabilization, platelet activation and thrombus formation causing myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular events5.&#x0D; &#x0D; Though tobacco cigarette smoking is 3 times more harmful than vaping6 the studies have shown that the vaping is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events as compared to non-users and the use of tobacco cigarette smoking along with vaping cause the highest number of cardiovascular events as compared to non-users, vaping or tobacco cigarette smoking alone7.&#x0D; The vaping epidemic and its potential hazards can be controlled by certain measures:&#x0D; &#x0D; Regulating the advertisements of e-cigarettes&#x0D; Reducing the access of adolescents and young adults to the vaping products&#x0D; Public awareness campaigns to educate children and adults about the harmful effects of vaping&#x0D; Reducing the second-hand exposure to vaping aerosols by precluding its use in the indoors and public spaces.&#x0D; &#x0D; The studies so far have not proved vaping to be an effective tool for smoking cessation, instead the user who start vaping for smoking cessation often end up using both and the use of vaping among adolescents increases the propensity of them to become tobacco cigarette smoker. In the author�s opinion the use of vaping should not be recommended, and its use should be discouraged owing to its adverse effects on health.",

For example, individuals with psychiatric disorders smoke at two to three times the rate of the general population and account for the use of about 44% of all cigarettes consumed in the US. There are effective psychosocial and medication treatments for nicotine dependence. There are seven Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for use in nicotine dependence treatment, including bupropion (Zyban), varenicline (Chantix), and five nicotine replacement medications (patch, gum, spray, inhaler, and lozenge). Psychosocial treatments are also very effective, however, this option has been more difficult to access. Many treatment providers do not offer these psychosocial approaches, however, counseling services are available via internet sites and phone lines. The best treatment outcomes occur with integrated medication and behavioral therapy, however, access to treatment and reimbursement to providers continues to be a barrier.",

Typical arguments against recreational drug use focus on legality, purposefully undermining the ability to reason, and harmful health effects. This argument recovers St. Thomas Aquinas' account of delectatio (pleasure) to argue that the pleasure sought in recreational drug use is immoral due to its disproportionality to the good achieved in the act of taking drugs. It then examines the use of alcohol as a helpful example for this argument since the recreational use of alcohol in low quantities is a case which can diminish the applicability of traditional arguments against recreational drug use.",

This is contradicted by the fact that when fully aware of the health impact, most tobacco users want to quit but find it difficult to stop due to the addictiveness of nicotine. Henceforth, Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) came into existence which temporarily replaces much of the nicotine from tobacco to reduce motivation to consume tobacco and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Various alternative nicotine sources (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) have been incorporated into tobacco cessation programs. Recent research is more focusing on rapid delivery of nicotine (Nicotine preloading, true pulmonary inhaler) and immunological approaches (nicotine vaccine) to tackle nicotine dependence. These NRTs are in general well tolerated and have minimal adverse effects. The review aims to summarize literature on various modes of nicotine replacement therapy methods currently used to treat nicotine dependence, and to give an overview about future possible approaches to treat tobacco use disorder.",

However, electronic cigarettes often deliver more potent forms of nicotine, such as nicotine salts and synthetic nicotine, which are masked by appealing aromas and flavors, thereby attracting nonsmoking children and adolescents. On the other hand, adults dependent on freebase nicotine (found in conventional cigarettes) often become addicted to these new forms of nicotine in electronic cigarettes. Dual use is common and poses significant health risks, potentially exceeding those of using either product alone. Dual users experience increased odds of COPD, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. Electronic cigarettes represent a new challenge for global public health and health professionals. There are currently no specific guidelines for vaping cessation treatment.

      "abstract": "Health is the starting point for everything. You can't be productive or feel good if you're constantly exhausted or dealing with a headache, right? For instance, if I don't maintain a healthy diet, take a break from exercise, face a difficult emotional situation, or lack good sleep, my work satisfaction and productivity take a nosedive. During the height of the coronavirus pandemic, I found myself exercising less, eating poorly, and having disruptive sleep patterns. This lifestyle took a toll on me and led me into such a state of frustration and lack of motivation that my doctor suggested I see a psychotherapist for potential depression. At that time, I was about to relocate, so therapy was put on hold. However, after moving to another country, I realized I needed a change. I delved into health-related literature, tried various approaches, and tweaked my routines in numerous ways. When I started properly caring for my sleep, physical activity, nutrition, and mental health, the benefits were soon apparent. I regained my motivation and energy, and within six months, I was feeling even better than before the pandemic. This experience taught me the fundamental importance of health and well-being, and I have maintained these practices ever since.",

      "title": "Caffeine Content of Decaffeinated Coffee",
      "abstract": "Caffeine is the most widely consumed drug in the world with coffee representing a major source of intake. Despite widespread availability, various medical conditions necessitate caffeine-restricted diets. Patients on certain prescription medications are advised to discontinue caffeine intake. Such admonition has implications for certain psychiatric patients because of pharmacokinetic interactions between caffeine and certain anti-anxiety drugs. In an effort to abstain from caffeine, patients may substitute decaffeinated for caffeinated coffee. However, decaffeinated beverages are known to contain caffeine in varying amounts. The present study determined the caffeine content in a variety of decaffeinated coffee drinks. In phase 1 of the study, 10 decaffeinated samples were collected from different coffee establishments. In phase 2 of the study, Starbucks espresso decaffeinated (N=6) and Starbucks brewed decaffeinated coffee (N=6) samples were collected from the same outlet to evaluate variability of caffeine content of the same drink. The 10 decaffeinated coffee samples from different outlets contained caffeine in the range of 0-13.9 mg/16-oz serving. The caffeine content for the Starbucks espresso and the Starbucks brewed samples collected from the same outlet were 3.0-15.8 mg/shot and 12.0-13.4 mg/16-oz serving, respectively. Patients vulnerable to caffeine effects should be advised that caffeine may be present in coffees purported to be decaffeinated. Further research is warranted on the potential deleterious effects of consumption of \"decaffeinated\" coffee that contains caffeine on caffeine-restricted patients. Additionally, further exploration is merited for the possible physical dependence potential of low doses of caffeine such as those concentrations found in decaffeinated coffee.",

The vast majority of them have drawn alcohol from the maternal breast and have been educated to believe that alcoholic drinks are the healthiest that exist; they see no alcoholic problem. The brewer, the distiller, the saloonist can find no alcoholic problem which will restrict their business. The ordinary merchant fails to recognize any alcoholic problem which forbids a reciprocity of business between himself and the vendor of alcoholics. The professional man searches in vain for an alcoholic problem which will offend the consciences of his clients.

Smokers have tried everything from “low” or “light” cigarettes; nicotine-infused chewing gum, lozenges and lollipops; dermal patches; and even hypnosis. The latest craze in the quest to find a safer source of nicotine is the electronic cigarette. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have swept the internet, reaching a rapidly expanding international market. Boasting nicotine delivery and the tactile feel of a traditional cigarette without the dozens of other chemical constituents that contribute to carcinogenicity, e-cigarettes are often portrayed as less risky, as a smoking reduction or even a complete smoking cessation product, and perhaps most troubling for its appeal to youth, as a flavorful, trendy, convenient, and easily accessible alternative to cigarettes.",

Through a review of literature relevant to the topic, a reflection is proposed that, among other aspects, classifies drug consumption into two modes, functional and dysfunctional, where in the former, it is used as a \"tool\" for work, without causing impairments to its performance, and in the latter, there is a change in consumption pattern, severely affecting professional performance. In the transition from functional to dysfunctional use, the drug ceases to be a means to become an end in itself, and although this does not occur with the majority of users, the conclusion is that, even in functional use, the individual's relationship with their activity is essentially adaptive, and therefore cannot be considered healthy.",

      "abstract": "El consumo de tabaco es un habito muy extendido en nuestra sociedad, a pesar de las graves consecuencias que esta adiccion conlleva para la salud. Aunque se ha demostrado que las senales asociadas al tabaco juegan un papel muy importante en su mantenimiento, todavia sigue abierto el debate sobre la naturaleza apetitiva o aversiva de los estimulos  de  tabaco.  Este  estudio  investiga  la  naturaleza  de  los  estimulos de tabaco en mujeres no dependientes de la nicotina (n = 21) y en mujeres con dependencia moderada (n = 16) o alta (n = 16) de acuerdo con el test de Fagerstrom. Para ello, se registraron los cambios electrodermicos y la respuesta de parpadeo del reflejo de sobresalto mientras las participantes contemplaban imagenes eroticas, neutras, de mutilaciones y de tabaco. Como era esperable, los grupos mostraron mayores cambios electrodermicos y el patron tipico de modulacion del reflejo de sobresalto ante las imagenes desagradables y agradables, consistentemente con las estimaciones subjetivas en valencia afectiva y arousal.  Sin  embargo,  la  reactividad  psicofisiologica  ante  las  imagenes  de tabaco  difirio  en  funcion  del  nivel  de  dependencia  de  la  nicotina.  Para  el grupo no dependiente (no fumadoras), las imagenes de tabaco fueron consideradas  tan  poco  activadoras  como  las  neutras  y  mas  desagradables, provocando parpadeos de menor latencia que las imagenes neutras. No obstante, a medida que aumentaba la dependencia, la reactividad psicofisiologica  ante  las  imagenes  de  tabaco  se  parecia  cada  vez  mas  a  la provocada por las imagenes agradables. Asi, solo el grupo con alta dependencia presento inhibicion y mayor latencia del parpadeo ante las imagenes de tabaco que ante las neutras. Estos resultados son consistentes con trabajos anteriores que demuestran que las imagenes asociadas al tabaco activan el sistema motivacional apetitivo en los fumadores y, ademas, sugieren que este efecto podria estar modulado por  el  grado  de  dependencia  de  la  nicotina.",

Die im Laufe der Zeit einsetzende Alkoholgewoehnung gibt dem jungen Fahrer das Gefuehl, auch nach hohem Alkoholkonsum noch fahrtuechtig zu sein. Die Motive zum Vieltrinken decken sich mit denen, die aus der Suchtforschung und -praxis bekannt sind. Bezueglich der psychischen Problematik gibt es keinen Unterschied zwischen einem jungen Fahrer mit Alkoholproblemen und einem aelteren, der mit Alkohol im Strassenverkehr auffaellig wurde. Die wesentlichen psychischen Unsicherheiten sind trotz altersbedingter Veraenderungen im Umfeld geblieben: nicht nein sagen koennen, sich leichter ueberreden lassen, Flucht vor Problemen, Aerger und Stress werden mit Alkohol heruntergespuelt. Bei entsprechender Behandlung kann ein Fuehrerscheinentzug im fruehen Lebensalter eine Chance fuer eine Neuorientierung sein mit Auswirkungen auf das ganze weitere Leben. Die Nachschulungsmassnahmen im Rahmen des Fuehrerscheins auf Probe sind insofern unzureichend, als sie bei hoeheren Promillewerten keine Suchtpraevention ersetzen koennen. Gefordert werden abschliessend die 0,0-Promillegrenze und ein frueherer Einsatz geeigneter Praeventionsmassnahmen. Titel in Englisch: Looking for freedom? Alcohol and young drivers.

      "abstract": "El cigarrillo electrónico (e-cig) es un dispositivo con forma de cigarrillo convencional que libera determinadas dosis de vapores de nicotina a través de un proceso de calentamiento electrónico. Los cartuchos de nicotina tienen mucha variabilidad en la cantidad de nicotina liberada, incluso dentro de la misma marca. No todas las marcas admiten que contienen nicotina, pero esta se detecta en la mayoría de unidades analizadas. El e-cig contiene habitualmente propelentes como el propilenglicol, que es un producto irritante pulmonar. El efecto respiratorio a corto plazo del vapor de un e-cig es similar al causado por el humo del cigarrillo y es causa de broncoconstricción. La mayoría de marcas contienen glicerina, y se ha detectado al menos un caso de neumonía lipoidea por esta sustancia. Muchas marcas contienen trazas de N-nitrosaminas, metales pesados y otros productos que se encuentran en el humo de los cigarrillos convencionales en mucha mayor proporción. Actualmente no se dispone de evidencia científica de que sea un dispositivo eficaz para dejar de fumar, por lo que no debe recomendarse de forma proactiva para este fin y puede interferir en el uso de tratamientos de evidencia científica demostrada para dejar de fumar. Puede tener un efecto indeseable al promover el inicio del consumo en adolescentes o retener a fumadores adultos en el consumo de nicotina y en la dependencia gestual. No se conoce bien la toxicidad de los vapores pero se sabe que no son inocuos, por lo que no deberían utilizarse en espacios públicos cerrados. The electronic cigarette (e-cig) is a device with a conventional cigarette shape that releases a determined dose of nicotine vapour through an electronic heating process. The nicotine cartridges vary significantly in the amount of nicotine released, even within the same brand. Not all brands admit that they contain nicotine, but this is detected in the majority of units analysed. The e-cig usually contains a propellant, such as propylene glycol, which is a lung irritant. The short-term respiratory effect of the vapour of an e-cig is similar to that caused by the smoke of a cigarette, and is a cause of broncho-restriction. The majority of brands contain glycerine and at least one case of lipoid pneumonia has been detected due to this substance. Many brands contain traces of N-nitrosamines, heavy metals, and other products that are found in conventional cigarette smoke, but in a much higher proportion. There is currently no scientific evidence available that shows it is an effective device for quitting smoking, thus it should not be pro-actively recommended for this purpose, and may interfere with the use of demonstrated scientific evidence-based treatments for quitting smoking. It may have an undesirable effect on promoting the starting of smoking in adolescents or keeping adult smokers consuming nicotine and on gestural dependency. The toxicity of the vapour is not well known, but it is known that they are not innocuous, thus they should not be used in closed public spaces.",

      "title": "Why I Smoke: Sociology of a Deadly Habit",
      "abstract": "Smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the United States. In the twenty first century everyone knows the harm that smoking can cause and yet people still willingly risk their lives for the habit. I am one of these people. I would not throw myself in front of a bus; I would not take Drano from my kitchen and choose to ingest it. One of human being's greatest instincts is survival. So why do I engage in this life threatening activity? The question cannot simply be answered in one way. There are physical, biological, social, and psychological reasons for the attraction of cigarettes. For our purposes I will use various sociological theories to understand why smoking has become such a huge force in my life and how society has played a role in this manifestation. Perhaps through researching why I smoke I will be able to see how I can stop. To people of my generation smoking carried along a million perceptions of what it symbolized. Smoking was cool and sexy. When we used to play house in third and fourth grade part of the game was to make fake cigarettes and pretend we were smokers. One of the most popular candies among my friends was candy or gum cigarettes that our parents would buy us. When my dad was a smoker I used to steal his packs and throw them away because I was taught in school how bad cigarettes were for you. As I got older and my parents became less and my peers more significant, it mattered more to me what kind of persona smoking illustrated than what I had been taught. I remember the first cigarette I ever smoked. I was in the seventh grade, twelve years old, behind a tree in my back yard with my best friend. She had smoked before, I hadn't. The girl I was with was a new friend. Until I met her I wasn't much of a rebel; I was more of a drama kid violin player who did what her mother said. This new friend was different from any I'd ever had. When she lit the cigarette and taught me how to inhale, I did not hesitate--as far as I can remember. It was too exciting; doing something I knew I shouldn't. It wasn't about smoking the cigarette, it was about what that symbolized in the life of junior high kids trying to find their place. I didn't start buying my own packs of cigarettes until the end of eighth grade. It became a pastime, a social event. We'd all go buy cigarettes after school and sit in the woods or at the park, or outside the mall and smoke them together. We'd practice how we smoked and look at ourselves in the mirror. When I was young the antismoking campaigns you see today weren't around. We knew it was bad for you but it was still cool. It said something about who you were and almost defined the kind of person or group you fit with. In ninth grade I began to be loyal to a certain brand of cigarettes, Parliament Lights. Despite what common research says I had never even seen these brands advertised before. I started smoking them because it was what all of my friends smoked not because Joe Camel told me to. Throughout my first two years of high school I was still a social smoker and could smoke and quit as many times as I wanted to. The fact of the matter is addiction sneaks up on you. Nicotine is an addictive substance. Obviously some of the reasoning for my becoming a full fledged smoker had to do with my body's dependence on the drug. At the same time cigarettes are addicting in other ways. I became socialized into and addicted to the smoking lifestyle. After all of my friends would sit down to eat, or when we were bored, upset, needed a break from work, or were drinking at a party, we would smoke a cigarette. It's a social thing. Sitting down with friends, smoking and talking is something that has occupied a great amount of time in my life. Smoking is even a way to make new friends. Asking for a lighter is a great pick up line at a bar. At Orientation before my first year of school I didn't know one single person. The boy sitting across from me at the lunch table said he was getting up to go smoke a cigarette. …",

      "abstract": "Alcohol abuse is widespread among all the peoples and cultures nowadays. In modern society alcoholism is not viewed as a disease any longer; it is more considered a behavioural disorder caused by dynamic and stressful life relations where alcohol abuse turns to be a lifestyle. Alcohol is the most commonly used drug among the young, which is not illegal, but it is illegal and forbidden for those who are under age. The reasons for alcohol consumption among the young are numerous: boredom, desire to be different or to be accepted by peers, fear of not belonging to a group or hope that it brings feeling of relaxation and joy, bad family relations with lack of communication, alienation and parents' attitude towards drinking alcohol and so on. All these have a great impact on young people's behaviour. Alcohol can cause permanent serious consequences if it is abused at an early age. A lot of research on alcohol abuse among the young has been done in the world as well as in our country. According to the alarming research statistics more and more youngsters start abusing alcohol sooner than ever before. The purpose of this paper is to present alcohol drinking among the young as a community health problem, to point at consequences of alcohol abuse and its harmful impact on human organism and to emphasize the role of a nurse in carrying out preventive programmes in kindergardens, primary and secondary schools.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco control policy seems to be based on a utilitarian principle that public health is best served by a range of measures that will provide overall population benefit. Aspirin may have a potential wider role since meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows it reduces the risk of a first vascular event and also cancer. Are smoking cessation and the public health potential of aspirin different? The benefit versus risk balance of aspirin, an inexpensive and easily available medicine, deserves serious consideration as a public health measure in middle age. Smoking cessation and wider aspirin use are not seen as either competing or duplicating policy areas, but complementary. Their comparison has been purposefully selected because of common impacts, namely reduced vascular disease and cancer with increases in undesirable effects, notably gastrointestinal pathology. Part of the driver for this paper is to convey the message that public health policy has benefits and risks and the concept of a universally effective policy is unrealistic. Is it time for public health action to increase the use of aspirin?",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion of the vaping market which has led many to question whether vaping can assist people in smoking cessation, or if it in fact paves the way for new smokers. While there has not been conclusive evidence regarding vaping as a smoking cessation tool, there is striking evidence that vaping is linked to new smoking addictions, especially in teenagers and young adults. Despite the prevalent belief that tobacco is more harmful to the body, early research on vaping has already shown very detrimental effects, and the comprehensive effects may become much clearer in the years to come. To curtail the rapidly increasing number of teenagers and young adults vaping, strict action must be taken. Legalization with tight control of vaping products would focus the efforts on those attempting to quit, while helping to prevent acquisition by teenagers and young adults that are not of legal age. In the years to come, vaping controls should be carefully considered to ensure that the purported benefits of helping those overcome a smoking addiction are not outweighed by the unintended consequences of creating a teenage demographic addicted to vaping.",

He is the director of psychiatric training at The Cambridge Hospital and a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School. Zinberg contends that the use of any involves values and rules of conduct, which he calls social sanctions, as well as patterns of behavior, which he calls social rituals. Zinberg argues that American culture minimizes the importance of social mores that can enhance our capacity to control use. He is convinced that the term drug abuse must be dropped from our vocabulary if we are to understand why and",

In this paper1 the drinking behavior of a Canadian Cree group is described and examined within the framework of theoretical schemes which attempt to explain drunken demeanor. The Cree data support the theory of MacAndrew and Edgerton who argue that drunkenness is equivalent to a time-out from daily behavior and tasks. The theory that drinking to the point of intoxication indicates sociocultural pathology among the Cree is rejected.",

El problema se agrava debido, por una parte a la falta de información sobre los riesgos que presentan estas sustancias y las medidas de seguridad que deben adoptarse durante su uso, y por otro lado al exceso de confianza, que hace abstracción del peligro cuando se trata de exposiciones a pequeñas dosis de tóxico por desconocer los efectos acumulativos que producen estas sustancias cada vez que ingresan al organismo. En el Ecuador existen pocos estudios que caracterizan la exposición a estas sustancias y ninguno sobre la incidencia del síndrome neurotóxico, siendo un importante campo de investigación. Los trabajadores que están expuestos a sustancias químicas neurotóxicas se han asociado con efectos adversos en la salud humana, por su peculiar agresividad y porque comprometen la seguridad del trabajador antes de quebrantar directamente su salud. Ingresan en el organismo por vía respiratoria, dérmica o digestiva, presentan gran afinidad con las grasas por lo que se acumulan y afectan a los sistemas, órganos y tejidos grasos como el sistema nervioso central, la médula ósea y el hígado. Se han detectado efectos inmediatos (agudos) y a largo plazo (crónicos), dependiendo de la intensidad y duración de la exposición.

      "abstract": "Summary The term ‘fat burner’ is used to describe nutrition supplements that are claimed to acutely increase fat metabolism or energy expenditure, impair fat absorption, increase weight loss, increase fat oxidation during exercise, or somehow cause long‐term adaptations that promote fat metabolism. Often, these supplements contain a number of ingredients, each with its own proposed mechanism of action and it is often claimed that the combination of these substances will have additive effects. The list of supplements that are claimed to increase or improve fat metabolism is long; the most popular supplements include caffeine, carnitine, green tea, conjugated linoleic acid, forskolin, chromium, kelp and fucoxanthin. In this review the evidence for some of these supplements is briefly summarized. Based on the available literature, caffeine and green tea have data to back up its fat metabolism‐enhancing properties. For many other supplements, although some show some promise, evidence is lacking. The list of supplements is industry‐driven and is likely to grow at a rate that is not matched by a similar increase in scientific underpinning.",

Cultural variations exist in its use; however, the West in particular has witnessed a surge in flavoured waterpipe tobacco use, known as moassel. This is typically shared among peers for 30-45 min, and is now the second most popular form of tobacco consumption after cigarettes in 20 out of 30 European countries. Contrary to the common belief that it is a safer method of tobacco intake than cigarettes, waterpipe tobacco smoke composition is known to contain significant quantities of harmful toxicants akin to cigarette smoke composition. Studies on the long-term health effects of waterpipe tobacco smoking, although of low quality in these early research stages, suggest significant morbidity and mortality is associated with its use. Cessation outcomes are promising although more work is needed to develop and test waterpipe-specific interventions. The waterpipe industry remains largely unregulated and threatens to undermine existing tobacco control policies. Government, policy makers and public health agents should consider waterpipe tobacco smoking as a growing public health concern that warrants attention, particularly in regions of high prevalence.",

The consumption of alcohol may be considered to be culturally rooted when compared with other drug use which follows a more recent epidemic pattern. For those who use other drugs, for example cannabis and cocaine, alcohol is commonly used in conjunction. Clearly the level of alcohol use and abuse is high in Spain and constitutes a severe public health and socioeconomic problem.",

      "title": "Tobacco based dentifrices: still not squeezed out",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Thirty-five percent adults (274.9 million) consume tobacco in India in some form or other with 21% (163.7 million) adults using only smokeless tobacco, 9% (68.3 million) only smoking and 5% (42.3 million) users of both smoking and smokeless tobacco.[1] The history and cultural rooting of smokeless tobacco when compared to smoking represents a distinctive challenge in India's tobacco control measures. The usage of tobacco based dentifrice may sound improbable and odd but it is very frequently practiced in rural areas of South Asia. The overall national prevalence of usage of tobacco based dentifrices was found to 5% in patients aged above 15 years in India.[1] However, tobacco based dentifrices are worryingly more frequently used by females (6.3%) in contrast to males (3.3%) and are also popular in children, thus posing a unique conundrum to tobacco control advocates.[12] Tobacco toothpaste (creamy snuff) and tooth powder are perhaps the most commonly marketed tobacco based dentifrices.[2] The various other tobacco based dentifrices used commonly are Gul (a pyrolyzed tobacco product), mishri (roasted and powdered tobacco), gudakhu (paste of tobacco and molasses), tapkeer (dry powdered snuff) and tobacco water (manufactured by passing tobacco smoke through water used only for gargling) that are commonly used in various parts of rural Asia.[1] The presence of nicotine in these dentifrices, even in small quantities, could lead to addiction and these dentifrices can lead to pathologies in oral cavity such as abraded teeth, dentinal hypersensitivity, pulpitis, teeth staining, gingival recession and oral mucosal premalignant lesions.[2] The usage of tobacco based dentifrices should be dealt with more seriousness and should be dissuaded sharply. There is a need to develop evidence based, culturally appropriate economic intervention for control of tobacco based dentifrice usage and an analysis of motivating influences for its practise should be conducted as there is a lack of research on factors leading to its usage.[3] Overall, the public health challenge of smokeless tobacco (especially tobacco based dentifrices) merits far greater interest and action than it has so far received.[4] Though there is a legislative ban of usage of tobacco in dentifrices, the effectiveness of this ban needs to be implemented properly as there is an easy availability of these dentifrices.[5] Moreover, the perceived prevalent misconceptions about efficacious use of tobacco based dentifrices in teeth cleaning need to be dismissed. Tobacco industries also deceptively market their products as herbal based, mouth freshener, and teeth whiteners that further increases the vulnerability of the less educated residents in rural areas. Growing prevalence of tobacco related cancers can be controlled only if there is a greater sustained public awareness about manifold risks of tobacco in its various forms and a better scrutiny of tobacco based dentifrices, especially in rural areas.",

Climate may be made to help toward it in some cases; but it does not always help—sometimes it hinders, and greatly does so. It is a pitiable waste when it does not help; it ought always to benefit somewhat or not be invoked. Many times it is worse than useless, and brings disappointment and chagrin where it ought to give comfort, and so throws discredit on the whole subject. A measure capable of so much good ought not to be discredited by the unwise use of it, or by unwarrantable belief in it. Fatuous faith leads to neglect of other needful things. Because",

Pourtant, il est scientifiquement prouve que la consommation chronique de cannabis est nefaste pour la sante. Les legislations a travers le monde sur l’usage recreatif du cannabis sont plus ou moins severes ; cependant, la plupart des pays ont signe les conventions internationales. Leur but est de limiter la production et le commerce de substances interdites en etablissant une liste de ces substances, qualifiees de stupefiants, dont le cannabis fait partie. Pourtant, il ne faut pas oublier qu’avant d’etre une drogue, le cannabis, Cannabis sativa L. , est avant tout une plante. Et comme beaucoup d’autres, ce vegetal constitue une matiere premiere pour la fabrication de medicaments. Les etudes se multiplient aujourd’hui sur le sujet et prouvent que le cannabis et ses composes, notamment le tetrahydrocannabinol et le cannabidiol, offrent des perspectives therapeutiques nouvelles dans de nombreuses pathologies, dont certaines pour lesquelles l’arsenal therapeutique actuel est faible. Les cannabinoides pourraient ainsi constituer une nouvelle classe de medicaments. Apres une periode de « diabolisation », l’opinion mondiale et les legislations sur le sujet sont en train d’evoluer, et ce de maniere variee selon les pays. En France, le decret du 5 juin 2013 autorisant pour la premiere fois la mise sur le marche de medicaments a base de cannabis est la preuve de cette evolution.",

      "title": "A Literature Review on Holistic Well-Being and Dopamine Fasting: An Integrated Approach",
      "abstract": "Popularly known as dopaminergic detox or dopamine fasting, it is a concept that aims at reducing dependence on instant satisfaction gratification and overstimulation to attain mental clarity, lessen anxiety, and be able to enjoy everyday events again. Digital detox has been a part of the dopamine fasting concept for several years now. However, some critics argue that this notion has no scientific proof behind it and may fail to deal with the problem of dopamine dysregulation. Some intense types of dopamine fasting which include extreme isolation or strict dieting can result in damage to mental health as well as physical fitness. The objective of the article is to understand what dopamine fasting means and see the literature and evidence available on the topic. Indexes like PubMed, Scopus, OVID, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched using the keywords to understand the existing knowledge about dopamine fasting. The literature review was then written to incorporate the understanding in a way that can be implemented practically. Recent studies have shown that individuals who engage in dopamine-fasting-like ideologies may experience reduced impulsive behaviors, increased focus on tasks, and reduced overwhelm. However, extreme forms of dopamine fasting can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and malnutrition, which can have detrimental effects on mental and physical health. Hence, the effects of dopamine fasting can vary greatly among individuals, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. It is essential to consider individual needs and preferences when incorporating dopamine fasting into one's lifestyle and explore alternative practices that align with the principles of dopamine fasting. Understanding and respecting these differences is crucial in determining the most suitable strategies for maintaining a balanced dopamine response and overall psychological health. The benefits of dopamine fasting can be tremendous if done correctly but it depends on every individual to find the correct way and in the modern day, the practices can become tough to implement.",

      "abstract": "The depletion or reduction of bodily carbohydrate reserves is associated with fatigue during endurance exercise. Various carbohydrate supplementation and exercise regimens have been used experimentally to increase carbohydrate reserves before exercise or to maintain the availability of carbohydrate for oxidation during exercise. On the other hand, the improved endurance capability observed after aerobic training has been attributed to an increased oxidation of fat relative to carbohydrate; this carbohydrate sparing presumably delays the point at which reduced carbohydrate reserves cause fatigue. This effect has led to the suggestion that a greater availability of fat during exercise can improve performance via the carbohydrate-sparing effect of “fat loading.” Although this is a plausible hypothesis, it is not supported by a sufficient number of valid, credible, and replicated studies. Thus, it appears prudent to advise endurance athletes to consume a diet that is largely carbohydrate to optimize training and competitive performance and, more importantly, to promote optimal health.",

      "title": "Clinical use of sibutramine",
      "abstract": "Since obesity is a chronic disorder, a long-term approach is essential, and modern obesity pharmacotherapy means medicating as an adjunct to diet and physical activity not only to achieve weight loss, but also to maintain it. Sibutramine is a US Food and Drug Administration- and European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products-approved medication with demonstrated efficacy in long-term obesity management. It is a norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitor and produces weight loss by a dual mechanism: reduction of food intake and increase in energy expenditure. Sibutramine is given once daily in doses ranging from 5-15 mg. The amount of weight lost with sibutramine is related to both the dose of the drug and the intensity of the behavioral therapy component. Sibutramine produces a weight loss from baseline of more than 5% in over 75% of patients who are prescribed 15 mg daily, and it produces weight loss that averages 5-8% from baseline, independently of the behavioral approach. Weight loss with sibutramine is associated with improvement in waist circumference, lipids, glycemic control, uric acid and health-related quality of life. Sibutramine use is associated with small increases in mean resting blood pressure, but the individual response is variable and not all patients will have blood pressure increases. The drug is also associated with small increases in mean heart rate and should therefore not be used in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmia. Because it is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, sibutramine should not be used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or noradrenergic agents, and caution is advised in prescribing sibutramine to patients on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Given the growing appreciation for the health benefits that can be achieved with even a relatively small weight loss, physicians must become adept in office approaches to achieve modest weight loss. Sibutramine is a useful adjunct to diet and physical activity approaches and can help selected patients achieve and maintain weight loss with concomitant health benefits.",

Although smoking is associated with weight loss, it increases insulin resistance and attributes to other features of the metabolic syndrome, increasing the cardiometabolic risk profile. Whether vaping has the same deleterious effects on metabolic parameters as regular cigarette smoke has not yet been studied thoroughly in humans. However, animal model experiments attribute comparable effects of e‐cigarette smoking, even without nicotine exposure, on weight and metabolic parameters as compared to smoking cigarettes. In this review paper, we want to give an overview of published data on the effects on weight and cardiometabolic parameters of e‐cigarette use and formulate some mechanistic hypotheses.",

One of the manifold negative consequences for mental health will probably be an increase in the prevalence of psychoses -- not only acute, toxic psychosis but also chronic psychoses. Schizophrenic psychoses are expected to be triggered at an earlier age and to be negatively influenced in their course. This eventuality could have deleterious consequences not only for many currently healthy individuals predisposed to psychosis, but also for the disability pension.",

Por cuestiones de estigmatización se aduce que los pueblos indios beben más que los mestizos, o bien se cree que los pobres toman más que los ricos. Con fines de diferenciación conceptual, el alcoholismo está referido al aspecto clínico y epidemiológico, visto como enfermedad; e \"ingesta de alcohol\", hace énfasis en la práctica de tomar alcohol considerando cuatro aspectos básicos: la cantidad, la calidad de la bebida, la frecuencia de consumo y el tiempo de práctica.",

Elle s'est diffusee bien au-dela de son milieu originel, elle jouit d'une bonne image et son prix baisse.L'origine de la cocaine est l'Amerique latine, 95% du trafic arrive par la mer, mais d'autres voies sont utilisees : la route ainsi que les voies aeriennes par le biais des « mules », ces passeurs qui peuvent ingerer de la cocaine enrobee dans du latex. L'Afrique de l'Ouest prend une part de plus en plus importante dans l'acheminement de la drogue vers l'Europe.En Europe occidentale, on observe une augmentation de l'utilisation de cocaine et de crack mais aussi une augmentation de la demande de traitement. Or il n'existe pas de traitement medicamenteux specifique, et en particulier de traitement de substitution pour ces formes de toxicomanies. La cocaine est un puissant stimulant. Elle provoque une dependance psychique importante et il est tres difficile d'arreter une consommation intense de cocaine tant le besoind'en reprendre (appele craving) est important. L'apaisement, meme avec la consommation d'une autre substance, est tres difficile a obtenir. Les effets sur le cerveau mais egalement sur les systemes cardiovasculaire et respiratoire peuvent etre redoutables. En outre, la plupart des utilisateurs de cocaine consomment d'autres substances ce qui rend leur prise en charge plus difficile. Des centres de soins specialises se developpent afin de mieux prendre en charge ce type de patients et surtout de limiter les risques associes (transmissions virales etc.).",

The popularity of e-cigarette has increased rapidly in recent years. The increase in its use during the adolescence period is attention-grabbing. Despite the fact that e-cigarette has become popular in a dramatic way, there are certain differences of opinion regarding its long-term effects on health, in particular. While some people assert that it is less harmful than conventional cigarettes, some others assert the contrary. Although e-cigarette contains less toxic substances compared to conventional cigarette, it contains certain carcinogens existing in conventional cigarette such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. It also contains heavy metals (nickel, chrome) that conventional cigarette does not contain; and therefore, raises concerns about health. E-cigarette leads to upper and lower respiratory tract irritation as well as an increased airway resistance and an increased bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract. It may also cause tahcycardia and increase diastolic blood pressure. Although e-cigarette has been found to have certain benefits in terms of smoking cessation, most of the studies have shown unfavorable results. In this collected work, the effects of e-cigarette on health and its role in smoking cessation are discussed in detail.",

Recientemente se han introducido los sistemas electronicos de administracion de nicotina, comunmente conocidos como cigarrillos electronicos. Este trabajo tiene como objetivos describir y exponer la composicion de los cigarrillos electronicos, efecto sobre la salud y necesidad del conocimiento de este dispositivo en la practica medica comunitaria. Desarrollo El cigarrillo electronico es un dispositivo con forma de cigarrillo convencional, consta de boquilla, bateria, camara de vaporizacion, el cartucho de la solucion, que es el que contiene el liquido que se convierte en aerosol, formando particulas finas y ultrafinas en fase gaseosa. Libera determinadas dosis de vapores de nicotina y otras sustancias a traves de un proceso de calentamiento electronico. Los cartuchos tienen mucha variabilidad en la cantidad de nicotina liberada, contiene otras sustancias como el propilenglicol, glicerina vegetal, propanodion, altas concentraciones de particulas PM 2.5, carcinogenos como los hidrocarburos aromaticos y aluminio, entre otros productos irritantes de las vias respiratorias. Conclusiones Actualmente se debate en cuanto a la seguridad y efectos sobre la salud, tanto del usuario como de los que estan expuestos a ese vapor.

      "abstract": "Abstract Our investigation of a cluster of three fatal overdoses casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that overdoses result from unregulated changes in the purity of street heroin. Use of alcohol or other sedatives can make an otherwise safe dose of heroin (or other opioids) lethal. In addition users can knowingly increase their dose, usually as an indulgence. Some media reporting of this cluster of deaths was accurate, but there was also sensationalization, perpetuating stereotypes about the drug market that may be untrue. Information flow within the using community was relatively accurate, but slow, possibly because it was the holiday season. Larger studies to substantiate our findings are needed. In addition, introduction of a user‐organization‐based epidemiological monitoring system for overdoses would be a valuable public health measure. [Bammer G, Sengoz A.

      "abstract": "Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and diminishes a person’s overall health. Millions and millions of peoples have health problems due to habit of smoking. It is now a burden worldwide because smoking addiction of teenagers increasing immensely. Globally, smoking is not only a leading cause of cancer as well as various heart diseases. Smoke contains several carcinogenic pyrolytic products like Polycyclic Aroma0tic Hydrocarbons (PCAH), acrolein etc. are irreversibly binds to DNA, causes genetic mutation and cancer. Various methods exist which allow a smoker to see the impact of their tobacco use, and the immediate effects of quitting. Using biochemical feedback methods include breath carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring, cotinine (metabolite of nicotine) can allow tobacco-users to be identified and assessed, and the use of monitoring throughout an effort to quit can increase motivation to quit. Pharmacologic smoking cessation aids like Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), bupropion, varenicline, cytisine etc. are recommended for all smokers trying to quit. Varenicline appears to be more effective than other available pharmacologic smoking cessation aids. Offering the choice of pharmacologic therapy in addition to supportive counseling, which is now available in the market, should help family physicians achieve greater success assisting their patients with smoking cessation. Family physicians should share the evidence with patients and encourage them to use pharmacologic therapy and counseling to improve the likelihood of success.",

      "title": "Commentary on Brose <i>et al</i>. (2015): Protecting individual and public health by regulating electronic cigarette nicotine delivery",
      "abstract": "Brose and colleagues 1 used a national data set from Great Britain to demonstrate that, in current tobacco cigarette smokers, daily but not non-daily electronic cigarette (e-cig) use shows a significant association with increased tobacco smoking cessation attempts and reductions in smoking behavior. However, e-cig use was not shown in this study to be associated significantly with tobacco smoking cessation. Taken together, this new study 1 and the extant literature (e.g. 2, 3) provide little empirical support for the contention that e-cig use leads reliably to smoking cessation for the majority of users. Tobacco cigarette smokers self-administer the stimulant drug nicotine with every puff that they inhale, and most of them are dependent on the drug 4. This dependence makes cessation difficult, in part because of an aversive abstinence syndrome that occurs during a cessation attempt (e.g. 5). Nicotine replacement medications act by delivering nicotine to the user and thus suppressing at least some aversive abstinence symptoms: the more nicotine, the greater the symptom suppression (e.g. 6). E-cigs are not marketed as medications in many countries, but are a class of products that use an electric heater to aerosolize a liquid that usually contains some combination of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, flavorants and nicotine. Despite not being marketed as medications, many smokers are attempting to quit tobacco cigarettes by using e-cigs daily; however, there is little information regarding the long-term health risks associated with daily e-cig use. Putting aside that concern, if daily e-cig use is to lead to smoking cessation for the majority of users, then e-cigs will probably need to deliver nicotine in doses necessary to suppress abstinence symptoms as effectively as a tobacco cigarette. Unfortunately, there is wide variability in e-cig nicotine delivery: 10 puffs from an e-cig may, for example 7, or may not 8, result in reliable nicotine delivery to the user's blood. Differences across studies can be explained by a combination of factors, including characteristics of the e-cig device and liquid, as well as user behavior 9. Those e-cig device/liquid combinations that are most likely to lead to smoking cessation may well be those that approximate the nicotine delivery profile of a tobacco cigarette (e.g. 10). Strangely, e-cigs that are far less effective at delivering nicotine continue to be marketed to smokers. For instance, 50 puffs from either of two Blu e-cig (Lorillard, Inc., Greensboro, NC, USA) models that are currently available on the US market deliver 23–53% less nicotine to the user relative to approximately 10 puffs from a conventional tobacco cigarette 11, yet Blu e-cig brands are rated as the most popular among US young adults 12. Perhaps relatedly, more than 80% of all US televised e-cig advertisements geared toward youth and young adults were for Blu e-cigs 13, and 90% of all US advertising expenditures for e-cig brands have been for Blu E e-cigs 14. The fact that some e-cigs that are advertised to youth and young adults actively also deliver very little nicotine is reminiscent of so-called ‘starter products’ common in the smokeless tobacco arena 15. Starter products allow nicotine-naive users to self-administer low doses of nicotine without experiencing drug-mediated adverse side effects and then, as tolerance develops, these users can ‘graduate’ to products that deliver increasing doses of the drug (e.g. 15). Public health policy-makers may want to recall this industry strategy when considering regulatory action regarding e-cigs. Further complicating this issue is that at least 466 distinct brands of e-cigs are marketed currently 16, some by major tobacco companies. Tobacco companies in particular may be interested in smokers who purchase an e-cig as part of a smoking cessation strategy but, as Brose et al.’s 1 data suggest, ultimately do not quit smoking, perhaps because the e-cig they bought underperforms a tobacco cigarette in terms of nicotine delivery to the user. Under this scenario, the tobacco company that sells the under-performing product profits from sales of e-cigs and tobacco cigarettes, while the smoker who purchased the under-performing product in addition to tobacco cigarettes continues to be at risk for tobacco-caused disease and death. Much has been written about the potential for e-cigs to provide public health benefit through a dramatic reduction in tobacco cigarette smoking (e.g. 17). This potential benefit may require science-based regulatory intervention to ensure that e-cigs deliver nicotine effectively to cigarette smokers, while avoiding e-cig-induced nicotine dependence in non-smokers via the starter product strategy. Also, some e-cig device/liquid combinations on the market today may deliver nicotine more effectively than the highly addictive tobacco cigarette 18; there is no clear public health rationale for such products, and regulation can help to limit their availability. Relevant foci for regulatory intervention that address drug delivery include product characteristics 9 and nicotine flux 19. Without meaningful, science-based regulation, there may be many future opportunities to report, as do Brose et al. 1, that e-cigs are not effective tools for helping the majority of smokers to quit using lethal tobacco cigarettes.

A sub-group of 28 of the 59 were polydrug users who used opiates, these polydrug users used the largest quantities of cocaine, most often, during their heavy use period and reported most problems with cocaine use. They were also most likely to be unemployed or have low incomes. Nonetheless, both polydrug and heavy users had reduced their cocaine use to relatively low current levels.

When we drink a drink, it enters the stomach and enters the bloodstream through the bloodstream. Blood transports it through the body into all organs and parts of the body. From all this it is clear that prolonged consumption of alcohol causes numerous damages throughout the body. Alcoholism is a long-term and chronic illness, and an alcoholic is a person who has become physically and mentally addicted to long-term drinking. Many physical and mental disabilities develop as a result of addiction, and social difficulties occur. Current inebriation and alcoholism should be differentiate. Not every inebriation means alcoholism, but every alcoholism starts with occasional inebriation. From time to time, inebriation becomes more and more frequent until it develops into a true disease.",

      "title": "USO DA AURICULOTERAPIA PARA A REDUÇÃO DO TABAGISMO",
      "abstract": "O cigarro e um dos produtos mais consumidos no mundo. Um de seus principais componentes, a nicotina e considerada fator causador de dependencia por se tratar de uma substância psicoativa que promove prazer e alteracoes no cerebro quando ingerida. Dessa forma, o estado comportamental e emocional do usuario e modificado, induzindo-o ao consumo viciante. Apesar de todo o conhecimento adquirido sobre os maleficios do tabagismo, milhares de pessoas continuam fumando e, a cada ano, novos fumantes surgem. Entretanto, torna-se importante salientar que atualmente ha uma grande preocupacao em promover a saude e qualidade de vida dos individuos, pois inumeras sao as campanhas e programas de tratamento para a reducao do ato de fumar, sejam por meio de entidades publicas ou mesmo privadas, pois o tabagismo tambem e um grande causador de molestias que reduzem a capacidade funcional dos individuos, impactando na produtividade dos mesmos. Dentre as inumeras tentativas de oferecer terapias que auxiliam o fumante a abandonar o ato de fumar, encontram-se as terapias integrativas e complementares. Praticas terapeuticas oriundas da medicina natural e oriental, as quais tem se mostrado serem bastante eficientes no controle e reducao do vicio de fumar. A auriculoterapia, pratica terapeutica pertencente a medicina tradicional chinesa, tem se destacado cada vez mais no cenario mundial como poderosa ferramenta para combater diversas molestias que interferem na manutencao da saude dos seres humanos, pois uma vez que se baseia na estimulacao de pontos distribuidos em areas especificas do pavilhao auricular, ocasiona modificacoes nao so em padroes funcionais do organismo, como tambem tem se mostrado eficiente em questoes comportamentais. O presente trabalho teve por objetivo, avaliar a eficacia da auriculoterapia como recurso auxiliar para a reducao do tabagismo, bem como acompanhar o grau de satisfacao dos participantes na pesquisa. Por se tratar de um estudo experimental de carater qualitativo, a metodologia empregada ocorreu atraves da aplicacao de sementes de mostarda em pontos especificos do pavilhao auricular, como indicado pela bibliografia e selecionados pelos pesquisadores. A amostra foi composta por nove participantes, homens e mulheres, maiores de 18 anos, que fumavam a partir de 15 cigarros por dia e que expressavam vontade de parar de fumar. A eficacia do tratamento foi avaliada atraves da analise e da comparacao do questionario de tolerância de Fagerstrom, aplicado no inicio e no final do tratamento; do questionario de evolucao, aplicados apos cada encontro e do questionario de satisfacao, que foi respondido no final do periodo de tratamento. Alem disso, utilizou-se tambem o diario de campo, para anotacoes diversas relatadas pelos participantes que integram a amostra. O trabalho desenvolveu-se atraves de seis sessoes, uma vez por semana, em que eram estimulados os pontos auriculares atraves da fixacao de sementes de mostarda ora na orelha direita e ora na esquerda. Os resultados obtidos indicaram que o uso da auriculoterapia mostrou-se satisfatorio para a reducao do tabagismo, pois houve reducao significativa no numero de cigarros fumados por dia, como apontados no teste de tolerância de Fagerstrom. Sugere-se, pela relevância do tema, a continuacao do experimento. Palavras chave: tabagismo; terapias integrativas e complementares; auriculoterapia.",

Whether it is a prescription medicine, an ‘over-the-counter’ pharmaceutical or a herbal remedy, pills and potions are seen by many as a quick and easy solution to problems which have little or nothing to do with medical disorders. Family doctors are besieged by distressed and demanding people who would much rather walk out of the surgery with a prescription than set about the more demanding task of finding practical solutions to their economic, social, and interpersonal difficulties. In this context it is hardly surprising that there is an equally unprecedented appetite for ‘recreational’ psychoactive drugs.",

      "title": "Making Decisions About Supplement Use",
      "abstract": "The use of dietary supplements is widespread among athletes in all sports and at all levels of competition, as it is in the general population. For the athlete training at the limits of what is sustainable, or for those seeking a shortcut to achieving their aims, supplements offer the prospect of bridging the gap between success and failure. Surveys show, however, that this is often not an informed choice and that the knowledge level among consumers is often low and that they are often influenced in their decisions by individuals with an equally inadequate understanding of the issues at stake. Supplement use may do more harm than good, unless it is based on a sound analysis of the evidence. Where a deficiency of an essential nutrient has been established by appropriate investigations, supplementation can provide a rapid and effective correction of the problem. Supplements can also provide a convenient and time-efficient solution to achieving the necessary intake of key nutrients such as protein and carbohydrate. Athletes contemplating the use of supplements should consider the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. Some ergogenic supplements may be of benefit to some athletes in some specific contexts, but many are less effective than is claimed. Some may be harmful to health of performance and some may contain agents prohibited by anti-doping regulations. Athletes should make informed choices that maximize the benefits while minimizing the risks.",

A war on drugs will not solve all the problems posed by cocaine. Alternative strategies must address fundamental problems in ghetto life: violence, poverty, poor health, no education, no jobs, and few reasons for not taking drugs. Despite warnings of pharmacological determinism, cocaine is like other psychoactive drugs. Even with cocaine, when alternative behaviours are possible most people avoid out-of-control use. Public health strategies promoting a harm-reduction policy offer advantages. Recent reductions in cocaine use are a consequence of education, awareness of good health practices, and interest in other activities. Alternatives could include cocaine in a safer, non-lethal and controllable form but are unlikely in a political climate where politics and law prevail rather than medicine and humanity.",

The habit-forming properties of smokeless tobacco are similar to those found with other tobacco products. A double standard is apparent when the use of smokeless tobacco is condoned.

      "abstract": "Caffeine is a very popular compound widely available in various beverages. It is generally regarded as safe, but several lethal outcomes have been reported after large overdoses. A 21-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department (ED) after ingestion of approximately 100 caffeine tablets, each containing 200 mg, resulting in a total amount of about 20,000 mg of caffeine. She was very irritable and complained about nausea, vomiting, and headaches. While the initial electrocardio graphy (ECG) showed ventricular bigeminy, most of the patient’s symptoms were gone after supportive care with anti-emetics and benzodiazepine. The rhythm was converted to a sinus rhythm without anti-arrhythmics. Because caffeine tablets are unavailable in Korea, acute large-dose caffeine overdoses have been relatively rare. However, there is an increasing risk of caffeine exposure through highly concentrated “energy drinks” or caffeine tablets from purchases on-line. Thus, physicians should be prepared to deal with the severe toxic effects of an acute caffeine over-dose.",

      "title": "Help your patients kick the habit with NRT",
      "abstract": "A: Nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes—one of the hardest addictions for our patients to overcome. There are two reasons why it's so difficult to quit smoking: the psychological strength of the habit and the physiologic strength of the withdrawal symptoms. NRT provides clean nicotine in a pharmaceutical form and can be used to assist patients in breaking the habit of smoking by easing their cravings for nicotine and lessening withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, restlessness, depression, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, hunger, and poor sleep. If your patient uses a sufficient dose of NRT in the right way, the cravings and withdrawal symptoms are reduced by 50%, allowing him the freedom to work on the behavioral habits that trigger cigarette use.Figure: Q: Last issue you discussed the importance of helping patients with smoking cessation. How can nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) be used to do so?You should familiarize yourself with the various types of NRT that are available so you can educate your patients about their proper use. Many smokers don't use NRT correctly and, therefore, won't achieve relief when using it. Nicotine patches, gum, and lozenges are available over the counter. Nicotine nasal sprays and inhalers (also known as puffers) require a healthcare provider's order. The nicotine patch can be used in conjunction with other NRT; in fact, combining the use of two types of NRT at the same time is proven safe and effective and will increase your patient's quit rate. NRT should only be used for patients who smoke 10 or more cigarettes a day. It's intended to complement other smoking cessation treatments, such as counseling, online programs, and quit lines; NRT shouldn't be viewed as a treatment unto itself. Stress to your patient that NRT doesn't make him stop smoking; behavior change and other types of support are essential. Instruct your patient not to smoke while using NRT because this can increase his chance of a cardiac event, although this is rare. It's recommended that patients use NRT for at least 8 to 12 weeks to have the best chance of quitting smoking. Patients usually have no problem discontinuing NRT use. Patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and those with heart disease should consult their healthcare provider before starting NRT. Instruct your patient to notify his healthcare provider of his decision to quit smoking because both quitting and the use of NRT will usually require a change in the dosages of other medication he may be taking. Also, if your patient is using the nicotine patch, instruct him to inform his healthcare provider before undergoing magnetic resonance imaging because transdermal medication patches may cause burns during the procedure. NRT is a safe and effective way to help your patients kick the habit. The consistent use of NRT doubles a patient's chances of quitting smoking.",

      "abstract": "Creatine is a natural component of the diet found primarily in animal products. Creatine synthesized in the liver is also released into the blood circulation. An important question to be answered regarding creatine supplementation was whether muscle total creatine concentrations could be increased. The vast majority of short-term creatine loading studies show a significant increase or a small nonsignificant increase in body weight up to about 1.5 to 2.0 kg. Increased lean body mass and muscular strength are primary goals of many individuals using creatine and performing weight training. The mechanisms linking long-term creatine supplementation to improvements in body composition and strength are more diverse. One theory is that creatine supplementation enhances the intensity of individual resistance exercise workouts, which over time augments muscle strength and body composition responses to resistance training. Short-term creatine supplementation has no effect on heart rate at rest or during exercise, even when performed in a high heat/humidity environment.",

Finding the scientifically validated boundary between acceptable moderate use and excessive consumption is a matter of individual metabolism, history of consumption, cultural environment, and, often, family history.",

Many adults use e-cigarettes for cigarette smoking cessation, but e-cigarettes are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and insufficient evidence exists to recommend their use for this indication. There are 7 available FDA-approved medications for cigarette smoking cessation; these include 5 nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), bupropion, and varenicline. Varenicline is a partial neuronal α-4 β-2 nicotinic receptor agonist whose use results in decreased craving and withdrawal symptoms. It is initiated 1 week before a patient's cigarette quit date. It is generally taken orally at 0.5 mg daily for 3 days, with the dosage increased to 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 days and then to 1 mg twice daily thereafter. The typical duration of treatment is 12 weeks, but some patients may be candidates for 24 weeks of treatment. Potential adverse effects include nausea, headache, and vivid dreams. Precautionary prescribing warnings include suicidal ideation and depressed mood. In 2011, FDA issued a safety alert regarding the potential risk of cardiovascular events in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease.3",

However, far too little attention has been given to the consequences of the use of social drugs such as ethanol and tobacco, which are by far the most commonly abused substances during pregnancy. While the deleterious effects of cocaine or amphetamines on the mother and the fetus are more pronounced and easier to detect, the addiction to ethanol and tobacco is usually subtle and more difficult to diagnose. As a result recreational use of alcohol and tobacco may continue undetected in pregnancy, significantly effecting pregnancy outcome and obstetric and anaesthetic management of these patients.

      "title": "Brain Health and Online Gaming",
      "abstract": "Now there is a world of 'serious' play-interactive games that are good for you and your brain. Brain fitness games with a foundation in science offer a varied, complex workout across different brain areas and aim to increase brain reserve, which is widely believed to delay mental deterioration. Many of us have one or more areas in our lives that we would like to improve: we want to lose a few pounds, break our nicotine addiction, or be more focused at work and at home. We don't have to look far to find a seemingly limitless variety of options offering to solve nearly any problem. We can purchase self-help books, join the local gym, even hire a personal coach. Yet despite these solutions, many of our issues are never fully resolved. The opportunities for change remain, but we eventually lose our drive to participate in them. Fortunately, there may be an effective alternative on the horizon: video games. Video gaming-perhaps an unlikely and potentially powerful medium for selfimprovement- has been gaining a lot of attention recently. The media has frequently portrayed video games in a negative light, often highlighting the addictive nature of games or the influence of violent gaming on the development of children. Recently, with blockbuster game franchises such as Nintendo's Brain Age and Wii Fit reaching new audiences with positive, family friendly experiences, more people are becoming aware that entertainment can be a motivational tool for healthy living. If games can help us to make important aspects of our daily routine more accessible and engaging, we are more likely to do things we are less motivated to do-especially when it comes to reaching long-term health goals that can be difficult to achieve and maintain. The Rise of Online Gaming The commercial release of video games began in the 1970s. These early games were simple experiences like Pong, a primitive table tennis game that originally sold around 19,000 units. Over the past four decades, video games have become more sophisticated and expanded into new mediums such as mobile phones and social networks, bringing in new audiences hungry for new experiences. As a result, the games industry has grown faster than any other entertainment sector and has recently surpassed global revenues of the music and film industries (Entertainment Retailers Association, 2010). As high-speed Internet connections have gained widespread adoption, games have branched from boxed retail products into downloadable games and online browser-based games. This shift has given rise to new genres such as casual games, which can be played quickly and easily with little learning curve, and social games, which are integrated into platforms such as Facebook. These new genres further broaden the demographic of game players. As of 2010, 42 percent of game players are female, and 29 percent are older than 50 (Entertainment Software Association, 2010). Games: More than Entertainment Interactive games are no longer the sole domain of the stereotypical male teenage gamer, and, as a result, the types of experiences being offered have also diversified. While nearly all games strive to deliver an entertaining experience, not all games have the primary purpose of entertainment. A genre that fits this description is serious games, which we define as interactive content that uses entertainment for the purpose of education and/or training. This genre encompasses a wide range of topics, such as health, education, and corporate training. Serious games are a subset of the emerging genre known as lifestyle games, which, in contrast, are generally less academic and more focused on delivering top-tier gaming experiences that can improve a person's life. Wii Fit is an example of a successful lifestyle game that has resonated strongly with broad audiences, including avid gamers as well as those new to video games. …",

      "abstract": "Two contrasting viewpoints by Stimson and Chapman in this edition illustrate the divisions in the public health community over e-cigarettes. Stimson argues that we should embrace and promote e-cigarettes, while Chapman highlights the pitfalls of this simplistic approach. Such contrasting views are perhaps inevitable given the infant evidence base surrounding this rapidly emerging technology, but the consequent uncertainty about the population impacts of e-cigarettes should preclude an overly firm stance either for or against—as we outline below, it is simply too early to know.\n\nTwo key questions surround this debate: are e-cigarettes an opportunity or threat to public health and how can we ensure benefits are maximized and harms minimized? As Michael Russell wrote in 1976, ‘people smoke for the nicotine but they die from the tar’. E-cigarettes deliver the nicotine without the tar, as their use involves no combustion. Common sense therefore dictates that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than cigarettes, and for the individual smoker who cannot or does not want to quit, there is little doubt that switching to e-cigarettes will be beneficial.\n\nThe population-level impacts, however, are far less certain. If taken up only by smokers or those who would otherwise have taken up smoking and if effective as a cessation aid, e-cigarettes will undoubtedly be a force for good. Conversely, if the heavy marketing of e-cigarettes, which has been found …",

      "abstract": "Vergeleken met circa tien jaar geleden is het aantal rokers en cannabisgebruikers onder jongeren licht gedaald en is het condoomgebruik toegenomen. Negatieve trends zijn de toename van overgewicht en alcoholgebruik. Psychische problemen komen relatief veel bij jongeren voor, maar zijn in de afgelopen twintig jaar nauwelijks toegenomen. Dit blijkt uit een RIVM-rapport over leefstijl (roken, alcoholgebruik, overgewicht, cannabisgebruik en riskant seksueel gedrag) en psychische problemen (emotionele problemen en gedragsproblemen) onder de Nederlandse jeugd. De gezondheid van de jeugd van 0 tot en met 18 jaar is over het algemeen goed. De ongezonde leefstijl van jongeren kan echter leiden tot ongezondheid; op de korte termijn, maar vooral op latere leeftijd. Daarom is preventie belangrijk. Preventieve interventies moeten een combinatie zijn van gedragsbeinvloeding van de jongere zelf en maatregelen gericht op een gezonde leefomgeving. Bovendien moet de aanpak meerdere ongezonde leefstijlfactoren omvatten, zoals roken, drinken en riskant seksueel gedrag, omdat deze vaak bij dezelfde jongeren voorkomen. Ongezonde leefstijlfactoren en psychische problemen komen vaker voor onder laagopgeleide jongeren. Jongeren op het VMBO vormen een omvangrijke en belangrijke doelgroep om de geschetste problemen te voorkomen. De relatie tussen etniciteit enerzijds en een ongezonde leefstijl en psychische problemen anderzijds is niet eenduidig.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in Children of Substance-Abusing Parents",
      "abstract": "In recent years, the American public has become increasingly concerned about the adverse effects parental substance abuse can have on the development of children. Issues surrounding \"crack babies\" and adult children of alcoholics have been widely discussed in the popular media, and have been addressed by lawmakers, educators, and health practitioners around the country. Although scientific evidence on this topic clearly lags behind public concern, a growing body of research data documents the ways parental substance abuse can reverberate throughout the lifespan of offspring. Until recently, most scientists have focused on the issue of whether parental substance abuse affects the development of children. They have asked questions about whether prenatal exposure to a particular drug is associated with a particular developmental problem: For example, is maternal crack use related to premature birth, does maternal alcoholism cause mental retardation, is maternal heroin abuse associated with attention deficits in school-age children, or are children raised by alcoholic parents likely to have drinking problems themselves? Although studies posing questions, such as these, have often found that prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse increases the likelihood that children will have developmental problems",

Cependant, il a ete montre, grâce a de nombreuses etudes, que le cannabis avait un impact negatif sur l’evolution de la maladie chez les patients schizophrenes. Sa consommation entraine une augmentation du nombre de rechutes, une augmentation du nombre d’hospitalisations et elle entraine egalement une resistance aux medicaments antipsychotiques. De plus, les patients schizophrenes consommant du cannabis sont moins observants avec leur traitement.\nPour cette these, une etude a ete menee au Centre Hospitalier specialise du Rouvray, sur deux groupes de patients atteints de schizophrenie (ceux consommant du cannabis et ceux n’en consommant pas).

In Indonesia, according to the Indonesian Ministry of Health in 2018, the prevalence of depressive disorders in Indonesia is 6.1%. Based on the 2013 Riskesdas report, the prevalence of suicide in Indonesia is mostly carried out by women, which is around 0.8% compared to men, which has a prevalence of 0.6%. Until now, the first line of depression therapy is the Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitor (SSRI) group. Although this drug is effective in improving symptoms of depression, this drug can cause several side effects such as insomnia or drowsiness, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. Therefore, we need an alternative medicine that can replace conventional medicine which has less side effects. Cinnamon is one of the many plants found in Indonesia which is believed to have the potential to overcome various diseases. Based on previous research, there are many active components contained in cinnamon that have anti-depressant effects. Active components such as Phenol, Cinnamaldehyde, Turmerone, Proanthocyanidin and Linalool as well as Eugenol can provide anti-depressant effects through anti-inflammatory prevention.",

      "abstract": "The pharmacotherapy currently used for alcohol dependence may reduce alcohol consumption and extend abstinence periods. However, it is effective in only about 30% of addicted subjects. Alcohol dependence is often accompanied by tobacco addiction, which can be caused by the fact that both alcohol and nicotine interact with neuronal nicotinic receptors. Experimental studies have been shown that varenicline, a nicotinic α4β2 partial agonist considered to be the most effective drug for smoking cessation, reduces voluntary ethanol intake and alcohol-seeking behaviour in experimental animals. In addition, varenicline reduces alcohol consumption and attenuates alcohol craving among heavily drinking smokers. These effects are probably the result of specific alcohol–medication interactions. Varenicline seems to be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol dependence, especially for subjects addicted to both alcohol and tobacco. Stosowana obecnie farmakoterapia zespołu uzależnienia od alkoholu pomimo zmniejszania spożycia alkoholu i wydłużania okresu abstynencji jest skuteczna zaledwie u około 30% osób uzależnionych. Uzależnieniu od alkoholu często towarzyszy uzależnienie od tytoniu, co może wynikać z faktu, że zarówno etanol, jak i nikotyna wpływają na neuronalne receptory nikotynowe. Wareniklina, częściowy agonista receptorów nikotynowych α4β2, uznawana za najskuteczniejszy lek w terapii uzależnienia od tytoniu zmniejsza u zwierząt doświadczalnych dobrowolne spożycie alkoholu oraz motywację do jego poszukiwania. Zmniejsza również konsumpcję etanolu oraz łagodzi objawy głodu alkoholowego u palaczy nadużywających alkoholu. Działanie to może wynikać ze specyficznego oddziaływania leku z etanolem. Wydaje się, że wareniklina jest obiecującym lekiem w terapii uzależnienia od alkoholu, szczególnie u pacjentów jednocześnie palących papierosy.",

      "abstract": "Prevention of injury involves identifying risk factors that would predispose one to injury and developing strategies to attenuate or eliminate their presence. Because muscle glycogen depletion is associated with fatigue and injury, it should be treated as a possible risk factor. Muscle glycogen stores are derived almost entirely from carbohydrate intake. Because there is a limited capacity to store muscle glycogen, and because muscle glycogen is the predominant fuel in exercise of moderate to severe intensity, the nutritional focus should be on carbohydrate consumption. Easy-to-follow nutritional strategies should be employed that will maximize muscle glycogen stores and delay the onset of fatigue. Individuals involved in activities lasting less than 60 minutes need to consume an adequate amount of carbohydrate daily and a pre-event meal before the start of the activity. However, individuals participating in activities longer than 60 minutes or participating in activities requiring repeated bouts of high intensity exercise need to: 1) consume an adequate amount of carbohydrate daily, 2) practice carbohydrate loading, 3) consume the pre-event meal, and 4) ingest carbohydrates immediately before, during, and after the activity.",

It is the life source of millions of tobacco farmers. The farmers relay their life on their farming. In these two contrary issues, the government as the organization that manages every aspects of its people’s life should make a regulation that comforting for both parties. They have to apply a new rule that advantage the economic sides of the farmer as well as protecting the society from the bad side effects of tobacco.

Areca nut chewers get used to the habit mainly due to social influence, stress, or lack of awareness. Some studies have reported a dependence syndrome related to areca nut chewing. Even though there are many ongoing research studies regarding tobacco addiction, less concern has been given to the areca nut addiction. There are only few studies related to areca nut cessation, and even those few cessation programs are mainly designed using tobacco cessation methodology. Sociocultural influence, behavioral factors, and accessibility are the main barriers to cessation.

      "title": "Staying Healthy",
      "abstract": "To move towards recovery after a first episode of psychosis, patients must focus on both their mental and physical health. People with a serious mental illness are usually less healthy than those without such an illness. This may be because of the illness itself, fewer opportunities for health care, or unwanted effects of the medicines taken to treat mental illnesses. People with a long-lasting mental illness sometimes also deal with other issues, such as cigarette smoking, drug abuse, unhealthy eating habits, little exercise, and having few relationships with others. Even though it can be difficult at times, living a healthy lifestyle is necessary for patients to feel better and move towards recovery. In this chapter, we discuss problems sometimes faced by people with psychosis and ways to deal with and overcome these issues. Specifically, this chapter focuses on the importance of not smoking cigarettes, staying away from alcohol and drugs, having a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise, and having good social support from family and friends. One problem sometimes faced by people with psychosis is cigarette smoking. About one in five people in the general population in the United States (about 21%) smoke cigarettes. Fortunately, this percentage is now decreasing because of the growing awareness of the health risks posed by cigarette smoking. However, a large percentage of people with psychosis smoke. For example, most people with schizophrenia (between 50% and 90%) smoke cigarettes. What’s more, this percentage has not decreased in recent years. People with psychotic disorders also have smoking behaviors that can cause even greater harm. Some of these behaviors include smoking heavily—up to two or three packs a day—and smoking cigarettes down to the filter where the greatest concentration of nicotine is. Why are people with psychosis so likely to smoke, and to smoke so heavily? Most researchers believe that it is because of the relationship between cigarette smoking, nicotine, and the symptoms of psychosis (see Chapter 2 on What Are the Symptoms of Psychosis?). Nicotine is a drug that affects anyone who uses it. In most people, nicotine may slightly improve attention and memory.",

      "title": "Effects of exercise on appetite control: implications for energy balance",
      "abstract": "At a time of increased obesity, decreased physical activity, and high food consumption, the relationship between physical activity and appetite control needs to be examined. Many people believe that the energy expended as a result of physical activity generates a drive to eat. However, a counterintuitive conclusion arises since there is no compelling evidence that increased physical activity increases energy intake. A suppression of hunger occurs following intense exercise; however, this effect is brief and has no influence on energy intake. Indeed, there does not appear to be any within-day effect of exercise on energy intake. Day-to-day effects of exercise on energy intake could occur, but only a few provocative data exist showing a delayed effect of exercise on energy intake 2 d later. Therefore, there appears to be only a weak short-term coupling between energy expenditure and energy intake. What about the effects of increased physical activity on food selection? The natural hypothesis would be that the energy reserves used during exercise would estimate a drive for a particular nutrient. There is no clear consistent evidence to indicate that in the short-term, exercise induces changes in food or nutrient preferences. In the long-term there is some evidence that physical activity is associated with an increase in carbohydrate intake, but it is uncertain whether these changes are biologically driven for a result of changes of a psychological nature. Contrary to a popularly held view, food selection and nutrient intake constitute patterns of behavior held in place by environmental contingencies and short-acting post-ingestive physiological responses; these patterns of behavior are relatively immune to modulation by the metabolic effects of exercise.",

      "abstract": "Helping cigarette smokers to permanently stop smoking is one of the most effective ways to prevent cancer. A physician's instruction to a patient to stop smoking and to offer assistance in this endeavor is an important motivator. Current guidelines state that clinicians should encourage all smokers who want to quit to use medications and should offer psychosocial therapies, as well. It has been shown that even brief clinician advice about smoking cessation increases quit rates. Five medications—bupropion, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, and nicotine patch—and one proven psychosocial therapy (behavior therapy) appear equally effective and safe; i.e., they all double quit rates and are associated with a less than 5% dropout rate due to adverse events. In 1998, approximately one third of those who attempted to quit smoking used a medication. Attending group behavior therapy to supplement medications increases quit rates but is not essential for medications to work. As there are no proven treatment-matching protocols, patients should choose the treat-ment(s) they believe will be most effective for them. In the future, people who continue to smoke will be individuals with severe nicotine dependence or psychiatric symptoms; thus, clinicians will increasingly be called on to provide pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.",

Food and physical activity differ substantially from tobacco in that they are essential to life.Whereas the goal with tobacco control is therefore to eliminate all use, obesity control focuses on reducing some behaviors (excessive and unhealthful food intake) and increasing others (physical activity). Moreover, tobacco control involves preventing use of a single product while controlling food intake requires addressing a variety of products, and engaging in sufficient physical activity may require encouraging a range of activities and dedicating a period of time daily.",

      "title": "Sense passar-se de la ratlla la normalització dels consums recreatius de drogues",
      "abstract": "La normalitzacio dels consums de drogues es un fenomen sociocultural esdevingut en els darrers vint anys en els paisos de l'Europa Occidental. La normalitzacio es tant el proces historic com l'actual escenari dels consums de drogues. Despres de la crisi de l'heroina dels vuitanta canvia l'escenari dels consums de drogues. Es difongueren els consums d'extasis, cocaina i cannabis en els contextos de festa entre joves normalitzats, on els consums nomes representaven un element secundari en la seva vida. Els nous consums es desvincularen del mon marginal de l'heroina i comportaren consequencies menys problematiques. En aquests darrers vint anys, els consums han deixat de generar alarma i s'ha produit un assentament cultural dels consums, es a dir, per les persones coneixedores del mon dels consums, drogar-se en certs temps i contexts es un element funcional acceptat. L'escenari actual es producte del proces de la normalitzacio, on la gran majoria de consums son compatibles amb les responsabilitats, generen pocs problemes i els consumidors es mantenen normalitzats socialment. Per tant, la normalitzacio es cada vegada mes accentuada i mes si es te en compte que per questions generacionals, cada vegada hi ha mes poblacio adulta que s'ha relacionat amb les drogues d'una manera satisfactoria. Resultat del proces de normalitzacio ha emergit el discurs de la normalitzacio. Aquest delimita els consums que s'entenen com acceptables i normals i tambe els potencialment problematics. Cada consumidor realitza una apropiacio subjectiva del discurs de la normalitzacio per a consumir i evitar danys indesitjats. A aquesta apropiacio se l'anomenara el discurs de la regulacio. L'acceptabilitat o refus dels consums es producte del discurs de la regulacio que continuament avalua la funcionalitat dels consums per a obtenir plaer. Per a entendre els consums com a normals, el discurs de la regulacio avalua el context, el temps, la frequencia, i les consequencies que provoquen. La imbricacio dels elements ha de ser compatible amb les responsabilitats del consumidor per a mantenir-se normalitzat. Si el consumidor realitza consums problematics l'entorn li penjara l'etiqueta de problematic i haura de modificar-los per a mantenir la normalitat. En el marc de la Societat de Consum a mes del discurs de la regulacio, la voluntat de mantenir-se institucionalitzat, permet que la gran majoria de consumidors no desenvolupin problemes. Tot i el proces de la normalitzacio els consums de drogues continuen remetent a estigma en diversos contexts formals (ambit laboral, familiar...), per aixo els consumidors han de saber manejar aquest tret. La majoria davant d'una interaccio opten per una posicio ajustada, es a dir, prefereixen amagar el tret de consumidor per a evitar consequencies negatives, tot i que, consideren que l'estigmatitzacio es desproporcionada. Altres es situen en la posicio autoestigmatitzada, tot i ser consumidors consideren que els consums son negatius i es un tret desviat. I els darrers, els transformadors mantenen un compromis politic per desestigmatitzar els consumidors, consideren que els consums son part de la societat i que no s'ha d'amagar el tret de consumidor. Es presenten en societat com a consumidors tot i la possible estigmatitzacio que poden sofrir. Aquests son els que mes ajuden a la normalitzacio social dels consums de drogues. En l'actual escenari dels consums, les politiques de drogues continuen perseverant amb el model prohibicionista. Tot i la implementacio de la reduccio de riscs i danys com a practica efectiva per abordar els consums, les mirades normalitzadores cap els consums continuen sent minoritaries. Per tant, vist l'actual escenari de normalitzacio i normalitat dels consumidors la revisio de les politiques de drogues esdeve necessaria.",

An emerging theme in smoking cessation treatment is the development of methods for interfering with these reinforcing effects. By attenuating nicotine reinforcement, treatments may enhance a smoker's chances of successfully remaining abstinent. Several treatment approaches will be described, including the use of denicotinized cigarettes, nicotine vaccines, nicotinic receptor agonists and antagonists, and modulators of brain reinforcement processes. These techniques highlight the numerous sites along the path between the cigarette and the brain that can be targeted for intervention. In addition to unimodal therapies, treatment combinations will be discussed that might more effectively block cigarette reward and thereby further enhance smoking abstinence.",

Although e-cigarettes are now regulated in Europe, we are still awaiting national regulation in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nOne can envisage three possible scenarios in which e-cigarettes are used: one good, two bad. Potentially, they could be useful to help tobacco smokers quit, replacing cigarettes and slowly dialing down nicotine levels, much as other nicotine delivery devices (gum, patches, inhalers, and so on) do. That would be a good thing, although the research that is starting to accumulate about this therapeutic use of e-cigarettes is so far not promising.2\n\nSecondly, e-cigarettes could be used to maintain a tobacco habit by allowing smokers nicotine intake in tobacco free areas, such as the workplace or home, because the vapor emitted from e-cigarettes is odorless and presumed to be not toxic.

Coffee, in particular, is the favored caffeine source in the United States, where more than 150 million people drink coffee on a daily basis. Coffee, one of the richest sources of antioxidants in the average American's diet, contains caffeine and other antioxidants that have the potential to confer both beneficial and adverse health effects. A growing body of research shows that coffee drinkers, compared to nondrinkers, may be less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, stroke, depression, death from any cause, and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Coffee appears to have a neutral effect on cardiovascular health. Although more research is clearly needed, coffee, when consumed without added cream or sugar, is a calorie-free beverage that may confer health benefits, especially when used in individuals who do not have adverse subjective effects due to its stimulating effects, and when coffee is substituted for less healthy, unnatural, and/or high-calorie beverages, such as colas and other sugary and artificially sweetened sodas and soft drinks.",

First, when there is no awareness that smoking can be responsible for a physical disease, e.g., chronic obstructive lung disease or a dependence disorder. Second, when smokers actually seek treatment but fail to respond positively. The first kind-resistance related to lack of awareness-may not be so common in adult US smokers, but is more common among young smokers. Information is crucial to increase awareness. However, such information must be presented in such a way that smokers respond to it. Whether a smoker takes action will also depend on what options and choices are available. Encouraging abrupt cessation as the only option is unlikely to motivate the smokers who have tried to quit many times and failed and those who do not want to give up completely. Alternatives such as quitting gradually-even harm-minimization-should be considered. Hopefully, taking some control over smoking with the help of, for example, nicotine replacement can increase self-efficacy and motivation to quit. For those who find it impossible to quit, harm-minimization procedures should definitely be invoked.",

      "title": "EFEITOS CARCINOGÊNICOS E MUTAGÊNICOS DO CONSUMO DE ÁLCOOL SOBRE O TRATO GASTROINTESTINAL SUPERIOR: UMA REVISÃO DE LITERATURA",
      "abstract": "O presente artigo é uma revisão de literatura que tem como objetivo discutir a relação entre o consumo excessivo de bebidas alcoólicas e o fato da mesma aumentar as chances de desenvolvimento de câncer de boca, faringe e laringe quando comparada com a população normal. Associado a isso, os efeitos antioxidantes do vinho como prevenção desse tipo de câncer são citados; todavia, de modo geral, não existem comprovações científicas a respeito dessa afirmativa. Discussão: O câncer sendo o resultado de modificações genéticas, que ocasionam descontrole de proliferação, diferenciação e morte celular, depende de efeitos iniciadores ou mutagênicos, como substâncias químicas. Logo, o álcool e sua influência sobre a carcinogênese varia conforme a tipo e consumo de bebidas alcoólicas e se agrava quando associado à outros hábitos. Entretanto, a quantidade total de álcool ingerida e a duração desse hábito, são mais significativas do que o tipo da bebida que foi consumida. Métodos: Foi realizado levantamento bibliográfico nas bases de dados do Scielo, PubMed, NCBI, Revista Arquivos Médicos do ABC e Europe PMC. Foram utilizadas as palavras chaves “álcool”, “câncer”, “neoplasias”, “trato gastrointestinal superior”, “alcoolismo”, “cavidade oral” e “digestório superior”. Foram selecionados 9 artigos e após a leitura de todo o corpo do texto apenas 7 abordavam o tema. Resultados: As literaturas apontam que segundo a análise de células meta-nucleadas de alcoólicos portadores de carcinomas orais, que o álcool está mais associado a tumores de cavidade oral, faringe, laringe e esofago. Além disso, o álcool pode influenciar as células proliferativas pelas vias intracelular e intercelular o que causa a exposição carcinogênica das células-tronco proliferantes na camada basal. Considerações finais: A associação do câncer no trato gastrointestinal superior tem sido estudada nos últimos anos e foi comprovado que os riscos aumentam devido a associação com o tabagismo, má higiene oral, distúrbios imunológicos e nutricionais.",

Beneficial habits include exercise and eating lots of vegetables. Unhealthy habits include drinking too much alcohol, eating too much comfort food, and spending too much time on social media. Our habits often take hold because we use them to soothe our stress, anxiety, and depression. Habits are hard to break because they are established in our brains in networks of our brain cells.",

However, their efficacy in some health outcomes is also fiercely disputed, and some side effects have been confirmed. To assess the quality and strength of the associations between spicy food and chili pepper consumption and different health outcomes. An umbrella review is performed in humans. Eleven systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a total of 27 findings are identified. The health effect of consuming spicy food and chili peppers is unclear. Furthermore, the characteristics and context of different world regions and populations should be carefully considered. Direct correlations exist in esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and gallbladder cancer. However, negative connections are reported in metabolism, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. Dose-response analysis reveals a significant nonlinear relationship between gastric cancer risk and capsaicin intake. The consumption of spicy foods and chili peppers is typically safe. However, high-quality proof is available to confirm this conclusion.",

      "title": "Efectos del consumo de alcohol en la adolescencia sobre los procesos de aprendizaje y memoria dependientes del hipocampo: administración intermitente-excesiva vs. Crónico-moderada",
      "abstract": "El alcohol es la droga de abuso mas consumida a nivel mundial, siendo ademas este consumo el de inicio mas precoz. Se ha demostrado que la adolescencia es una etapa especialmente vulnerable a los efectos del alcohol y, en las ultimas decadas, ha surgido entre la poblacion mas joven un nuevo patron de ingesta de alcohol, llamado binge drinking, que consiste en el consumo intermitente y de grandes cantidades de esta droga en un breve periodo de tiempo. Por ello, en este trabajo, utilizando un modelo animal de autoadministracion y otro de administracion intraperitoneal, ambos durante la adolescencia, se ha evaluado si el patron de consumo de alcohol (cronico-moderado vs. intermitente-excesivo) es un factor relevante en los efectos de esta droga sobre los procesos de aprendizaje y memoria espacial dependientes del hipocampo, asi como sobre los mecanismos plasticos subyacentes, la expresion de diferentes proteinas hipocampales y la supervivencia neuronal. Nuestros resultados revelan que ambas formas de consumo provocan el deterioro del aprendizaje y la memoria espacial, y que, en el caso del consumo intermitente-excesivo, los efectos son dependientes de la dosis. Por otro lado, el consumo intermitente-excesivo de alcohol produce alteraciones en la plasticidad sinaptica hipocampal, en concreto inhibiendo la depresion a largo plazo (LTD) y cambios en la proporcion de las subunidades de los principales receptores AMPA hipocampales (GluA1/2 y GluA2/3), mientras que la administracion cronico-moderada induce principalmente cambios en la expresion genica y proteica de la mayoria de las subunidades de los receptores NMDA y un desequilibrio en la proporcion de receptores AMPA. En ambos tipos de administracion, se observa un aumento en la fosforilacion de la proteina glucogeno sintasa quinasa 3 beta (GSK3β) en Ser9, mecanismo de inactivacion de esta quinasa, que correlaciona positivamente con el deterioro de la memoria espacial encontrado, es decir, a mayor inactivacion de esta quinasa, mayor deficit de memoria espacial. Por otro lado, en este trabajo tambien se ha estudiado el fosfoproteoma hipocampal y se ha demostrado que la administracion no contingente de una unica dosis de alcohol, durante la adolescencia, disminuye la fosforilacion de algunas proteinas (PSA3, GLNA y SODm) en el hipocampo. Al estudiar los patrones de consumo, se observo que la administracion cronico-moderada reduce la expresion de la mayoria de proteinas identificadas (como GBB1, NAPG, COPS6 y LDH-B), mientras que la intermitente-excesiva las aumenta, independientemente de la dosis (MDH1, PSMA2, ARPC2, SODm, PPIA, entre otras). Casi todas las proteinas que sufrieron cambios por la administracion de alcohol, ya fuese de manera aguda, cronica o intermitente, estan relacionadas con procesos de neurodegeneracion y neuroproteccion. En conclusion, los efectos del consumo de alcohol en la adolescencia sobre los procesos hipocampales son dependientes del patron de consumo y, cuando este es intermitente, la dosis administrada se convierte en un factor clave. Ademas, el nivel de activacion de GSK3β parece ser un buen biomarcador del dano hipocampal provocado por esta droga.",

However, most clients do agree music that promotes violence is never very helpful. The chapter shows that clients often find a spiritual practice helps them cope with their voices, or with the anxiety which arises from hearing voices. Finding an activity to distract from the voices is a popular way clients cope. Group clients frequently say they notice a correlation between substance use and their voices. When clients use street drugs and/or alcohol, they notice their voices become more pronounced, nastier, and/or scarier. When these clients discontinue their substance use or cut way back, the voices recede. Tracking voices has helped many clients recognize their triggers and make lifestyle adjustments.",

      "abstract": "Energy drinks contain several ingredients with primarily stimulating effects. Consumption of these drinks greatly increased in the last several years, especially among young people. Recently, scientists focused on investigating their safety. Apart from its desirable effects like boosted mental and physical performance, studies show that energy drinks can also cause adverse effects, which currently remain not well described. The purpose of this article was to present current trends in energy drink consumption among young adults and to describe the mechanisms of adverse effects, which might be caused by it. The ingredients of energy drinks, like caffeine, consumed in high doses ( > 200 mg/day), were shown to cause shaking, dizziness, heart palpitations, and sleep disorders. The excessive consumption of energy drinks can also lead to electrolyte imbalance, and heart-related diseases, e.g. myocardial infarction. It is essential to familiarise oneself with the composition of the energy drinks and follow the recommendations for maximum daily intake of substances contained in these drinks. In addition, it is necessary to raise awareness of pharmacological mechanisms of possible side effects and to further the research on the consumption of energy drinks, especially among young people.",

      "title": "Smoking cessation changes basic metabolism, body weight, leptin and insulin levels, adipose tissue percentage, index of insulin resistance and index of insulin secretion",
      "abstract": "Background It is known that nicotine increases energy expenditure, basic metabolism and has appetite-suppressing properties, which likely explains why smokers tend to have lower body weight than non-smokers and why smoking cessation is followed by weight gain up to 12 kgr (7 kgr in median). Thus smoking cessation often has the disadvantage of increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome; fact that both decreases the benefits of smoking cessation and can discourage smokers (mostly women) from quitting. On the top of that, weight gain has been found to increase the risk of relapse, particularly among normalweight or underweight women who report chronic dieting, but also among men. Varenicline is a nicotiniccholinergic receptor partial agonist and therefore should share nicotine’s properties. Thus we believe that during its intake for three months in the process of smoking cessation basic metabolism will be sustained in levels comparable to these while smoking. During this period ex-smokers are also protected from withdrawal syndromes and thus capable of following psychological and physical activity counselling in order to sustain stable body weight. Quitting smoking is a process of changing life habits and is extremely difficult due to the addictive properties of nicotine. Post cessation weight gain decreases the benefits and leads to increased relaption rates. Varenicline improves succession and decrease relaption rates. Materials and methods During the three months period of varenicline intake, we enrolled 15 smokers that visited our smoking cessation clinic and succeeded in quitting smoking. Eight used varenicline. Basic metabolism and body weight were measured before (BSC) and one month after smoking cessation (ASC).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Cigarette smoking induces many chronic illnesses, but in developed countries it is a preventable risk factor. However, by increasing the protective protection mechanism, it may be possible to alleviate the smoke-induced damage. As smoking risk is minimised by vitamin C intake, it is recommended that smokers should take more vitamin C. This inverse correlation between both vitamin C intake and serum levels and smoking was independent of age, sex, body weight, ethnicity, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The negative association between cigarette smoking and serum vitamin C levels continued, following further adjustment for dietary vitamin C intake. The risk of severe hypovitaminosis C, especially when not accompanied by vitamin supplementation, has been increased in smokers. These data indicate that the inverse relationship between smoking and serum vitamin C levels exists independently of dietary intake, while smoking adversely affects preferences for vitamin C rich foods.&#x0D; Methods: A survey method was performed, with 50 smokers (S) receiving either 500 mg of vitamin C or placebo (P) daily for 4 weeks, and 50 non-smokers receiving vitamin C without supplementation. All finished the hearing. Both groups were equal and C: 14.2 + /- 1.8 pack-years was the amount of cigarettes smoked. Concentrations of plasma vitamin C increased significantly (p &lt; 0.005) only in the vitamin C supplement community. &#x0D; Results: At SMHRC Hospital Nagpur, we examined the relationship between smoking and vitamin C status, dietary and serum vitamin C levels of 100 participants. Smokers of 20 cigarettes a day had the lowest dietary intake of vitamin C and serum levels, whereas smokers of 1-19 cigarettes a day had lower intake of vitamin C and serum levels (compared to respondents who had never smoked. This inverse correlation between vitamin C and smoking intake and serum levels was independent of age, sex, body weight, race, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The negative association between cigarette smoking and serum vitamin C levels continued, following further adjustment for dietary vitamin C intake. In smokers, the risk of severe hypo-vitaminosis C, particularly when not accompanied by vitamin supplementation, has increased.&#x0D; Conclusion: These data indicate that the inverse relationship between smoking and serum vitamin C levels exists independently of dietary intake, while smoking adversely affects preferences for vitamin C rich foods. A balanced diet for smokers will obtain a hearty recommendation at this time, but guidelines should remain cautious about high-dose nutrition supplements.&#x0D; Keywords: Chain Smoker, Vitamin C, hypo-vitaminosis C and cigarette.",

However, little is known about the experiences of overdose among people who smoke drugs accessing the toxic drug supply. This study explores perceptions and experiences of overdose among people who smoke drugs.",

      "abstract": "Apos um levantamento sobre conhecimentos e consumo de drogas entre alunos de Brasilia, os autores fazem uma analise quanto a incidencia de sexo e idade nos estudantes que se declararam consumidores de drogas. Compara-se com outros trabalhos epidemiologicos sobre consumo de drogas que destacam sexo e idade. Quanto ao uso de fumo e alcool, os dados mostram um consumo um pouco mais acentuado na populacao masculina; no conjunto, o consumo de alcool e mais elevado do que o de tabaco, apesar dos fumantes progredirem mais rapidamente. A distribuicaodo uso de outras drogas, legais e ilegais segundo o sexo, apresenta diferencas altamente significativas. A populacao masculinatende mais para drogas ilegais e nao medicamentosas, sendo os inalantes os mais consumidos. A populacao feminina demonstra uma inclinacao maior pelos psicotropicos medicamentosos (tranquilizantes, hipnoticos e analgesicos). O uso ocasional detranquilizantes parece ultrapassar a experimentacao. Os dados agrupados segundo a idade contradizem a ideia segundo a qual a experimentacao de drogas leva a um uso intensificado. Quanto a validacao das pesquisas epidemiologicas em geral, conclui-se que os resultados dependem muito das caracteristicas regionais, locais e demograficas da amostra, sendo necessario uma complementacao em outras faixas populacionais, para se chegar a visoes mais abrangentes.",

      "abstract": "College students with positive (FH+) and negative (FH-) family history for heavy frequent alcohol use showed no differences in age of first drink, amount consumed then, amount currently consumed, current frequency, maximum consumed, or effect of current alcohol consumed. However, there were FH background differences in the reasons identified for ending, but not for starting, drinking episodes involving intoxication. The realization of already drinking too much ended these drinking episodes more often among FH- than for FH+ subjects. In contrast, nausea and lateness of the hour were related to the end of drinking more often for FH+ subjects.",

      "abstract": "From the Western countries a new dangerous phenomenon is approaching the Central and Eastern Europe. The pressure on psychical performance while studying and at work is becoming that hard that many individuals are reaching for stimulants. When cigarettes, coffee and energy drinks do not help anymore, the next in row are compulsory prescription drugs, which have been developed for entirely different purposes and which can sometimes have far-reaching lifelong consequences for the health. This phenomenon is called brain doping or cognitive enhancement.",
